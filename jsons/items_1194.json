This is normally interpreted as the satisfactory completion  of Conversation and Composition (FREN-UA 30) with the grade of B- or  better (or an equivalent course or exam). No grade lower than C may  be counted toward the major. The overall GPA in French courses must  be 2.0 or above.      The major consists of  nine 4-point courses (36 points), distributed as follows:         Written  Contemporary French (FREN-UA 105). Advanced Composition (FREN-UA  9106, taught in Paris) may be substituted. Three core courses.  Every major must take at least one course in the two-course sequence   Readings in French Literature I: From the Middle Ages to the French  Revolution (FREN-UA 120) and Readings in French Literature II: From  1800 to the Present (FREN-UA 121). The other core courses to choose  from are: Approaches to Francophone Literature (FREN-UA 145), French  Society and Culture from the Middle Ages to 1900 (FREN-UA 163), and   Contemporary France (FREN-UA 164). Four electives. Up  to two electives may be advanced language courses chosen from:   Phonetics (FREN-UA 103), Translation (FREN-UA 107), Advanced  Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108), Acting French (FREN-UA 109),  and Business French (FREN-UA 110). The other electives must revolve  around French and Francophone literature and civilization. With  permission of the adviser, students may take some electives at the  same time as core courses. With permission, students may also  substitute additional core courses, or a graduate course, for  electives. Approved courses taken in French universities may count as  electives. A Senior Seminar.   The Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992) is typically taken in the fall  or spring of senior year.            At least one of the  courses completed in fulfillment of the major (either a core course  or an elective) must focus on the period preceding 1800. Majors may  count one of the department's English-language courses toward the  major, but only if they do the written work in French.      Transfer students must  complete at least five courses (20 points) of the nine courses  required for the French major at the College of Arts and Science or  at NYU Paris.      A student who fulfills  the requirements above may thereby fulfill the state minimum of 24  credits required for certification to teach French in New York State  junior or senior high schools.

Major in Romance  Languages    See the Romance Languages section of this Bulletin for details and requirements.         Major in French and  Linguistics    This joint major  requires a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points).      The French part of this  major is satisfied by taking four 4-point courses (16 points) as  follows:      One advanced  language course chosen from the following:    Phonetics (FREN-UA 103) Translation (FREN-UA 107) Acting French (FREN-UA 109) Business French (FREN-UA 110) One course in  advanced written French (usually Written Contemporary French , FREN-UA  105) Two courses in  French literature (in French), to be determined in consultation with  the director of undergraduate studies                  The linguistics part of  this major is satisfied by taking the following five courses (20  points):         One introductory  course: Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 28) Sound and Language   (LING-UA 11) Grammatical  Analysis (LING-UA 13) A total of two  additional courses from two different fields of linguistics, chosen  from the following (please see Linguistics in this Bulletin for  course titles and descriptions): Historical linguistics (LING-UA 14, LING-UA 17, LING-UA 76) Sociolinguistics (LING-UA 15, LING-UA 18, LING-UA 30, LING-UA 38) Phonology (LING-UA 12)    Syntax and Semantics (LING-UA 4)    Computational linguistics (LING-UA 3, LING-UA 24) Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5, LING-UA 43, LING-UA 54)                        Minors in French    All students who wish  to minor in the Department of French must declare with the department  and consult a departmental adviser prior to any registration.      Students may choose one  of four programs of study. They may minor in French studies, French  literature in translation, literature in translation, or Francophone  studies.      French Studies    Four courses (16  points) conducted in French. This minor normally consists of four  courses above the intermediate level, to be determined in  consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. No grade  lower than C counts toward this minor.      French Literature in  Translation    Four courses (16  points) in French literature in translation offered by the  department, to be determined in consultation with the director of  undergraduate studies. Not open to French majors. No grade lower than  C counts toward this minor.      Literature in  Translation    See the section   Literature in Translation in this Bulletin.      Francophone Studies    Four courses (16  points) in Francophone studies, to be determined in consultation with  the director of undergraduate studies. No grade lower than C counts  toward this minor.        Honors in French      Eligibility    A student must spend a  minimum of three full semesters in residence at the College of Arts  and Science. Attendance at NYU Paris counts toward  such residence. The student must maintain a general GPA of at least  3.65 and a major average of 3.65 or higher. Students who wish to  pursue honors should apply to the departmental director of honors  during their junior year.      Requirements for  Honors:      Completion of all  major requirements (above). In addition to  enrollment in a Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992), candidates for  French honors must enroll in Honors Thesis (FREN-UA 995), a 4-point  course taken over both semesters of the senior year (2 points in the  fall, 2 points in the spring). This Honors Thesis course sequence  cannot count toward completion of the credit requirements for the  French major. The honors thesis  should be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field of  French literature, culture, or Francophonie. The thesis is ordinarily  written in French (25 pages minimum); exceptionally, students may  petition to write it in English (40 to 60 pages). The seminar  professor and the thesis adviser determine based on this work and an  oral defense whether to recommend the student for an honors degree. A  grade of at least A- is required for the award of honors in French.            Internships    In addition to the  basic requirements for the major, students also have the opportunity  to participate in internships sponsored by the Department of French.  Recent internships have been completed at the French cultural  services office, the French music office, and the French film office.  For more information, please contact the undergraduate administrative  aide. Internships and independent studies do not count toward the  French major, except with special permission of the department.         Accelerated  B.A./M.A. Program in French or French Studies    The Department of  French and the Institute of French Studies offer qualified students  the opportunity to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees in a shortened  period of study. While still undergraduates, students enrolled in the  program may earn up to 12 points toward the M.A. by completing three  graduate courses in the Department of French or at the Institute of  French Studies. To earn advanced standing, these points may not be  counted toward an undergraduate degree, but must be in excess of the  128 points required for the B.A.      Under normal  circumstances, this can be achieved by students who register for the  maximum allowable number of points in their senior year. Earned in  this manner, advanced standing has the additional advantage of  enabling qualified students to start graduate work at an earlier  stage and in the most cost-efficient way.      Admission to the  program is open to students who have completed between 48 and 96  credits with a GPA of at least 3.5 and a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or  higher in the major. Application to the program can be made through  the director of undergraduate studies in French. Final acceptance  into the graduate sequence of the program is contingent on successful  completion of the B.A., formal admission into the Graduate School of  Arts and Science, and acceptance of the student's application. For  more information on the B.A./M.A. in French studies, please consult   www.ifs.as.nyu.edu/object/ifs.bama .        Facilities    The University has two  special facilities for students of French.      La Maison Fran\u00e7aise    This attractive house  in the old and picturesque Washington Mews is open to students of  French. It has a comfortable lounge, a small reading room opening  onto a terrace, and a soundproof music room. Programs of lectures and  recreational activities free to all students interested in French are  given here.      Institute of French  Studies    Adjacent to La Maison  Fran\u00e7aise in Washington Mews, the institute offers graduate courses  in contemporary French society and culture that are open to  undergraduates with special permission. The institute has a large  newspaper and periodical collection and a wide range of videotapes;  it also organizes frequent lectures and seminars by visiting  scholars, political personalities, and business and administrative  leaders from France.

Students may choose one  of four programs of study. They may minor in French studies, French  literature in translation, literature in translation, or Francophone  studies.      French Studies    Four courses (16  points) conducted in French. This minor normally consists of four  courses above the intermediate level, to be determined in  consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. No grade  lower than C counts toward this minor.      French Literature in  Translation    Four courses (16  points) in French literature in translation offered by the  department, to be determined in consultation with the director of  undergraduate studies. Not open to French majors. No grade lower than  C counts toward this minor.      Literature in  Translation    See the section   Literature in Translation in this Bulletin.      Francophone Studies    Four courses (16  points) in Francophone studies, to be determined in consultation with  the director of undergraduate studies. No grade lower than C counts  toward this minor.        Honors in French      Eligibility    A student must spend a  minimum of three full semesters in residence at the College of Arts  and Science. Attendance at NYU Paris counts toward  such residence. The student must maintain a general GPA of at least  3.65 and a major average of 3.65 or higher. Students who wish to  pursue honors should apply to the departmental director of honors  during their junior year.      Requirements for  Honors:      Completion of all  major requirements (above). In addition to  enrollment in a Senior Seminar (FREN-UA 991, 992), candidates for  French honors must enroll in Honors Thesis (FREN-UA 995), a 4-point  course taken over both semesters of the senior year (2 points in the  fall, 2 points in the spring). This Honors Thesis course sequence  cannot count toward completion of the credit requirements for the  French major. The honors thesis  should be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field of  French literature, culture, or Francophonie. The thesis is ordinarily  written in French (25 pages minimum); exceptionally, students may  petition to write it in English (40 to 60 pages). The seminar  professor and the thesis adviser determine based on this work and an  oral defense whether to recommend the student for an honors degree. A  grade of at least A- is required for the award of honors in French.            Internships    In addition to the  basic requirements for the major, students also have the opportunity  to participate in internships sponsored by the Department of French.  Recent internships have been completed at the French cultural  services office, the French music office, and the French film office.  For more information, please contact the undergraduate administrative  aide. Internships and independent studies do not count toward the  French major, except with special permission of the department.         Accelerated  B.A./M.A. Program in French or French Studies    The Department of  French and the Institute of French Studies offer qualified students  the opportunity to earn the B.A. and M.A. degrees in a shortened  period of study. While still undergraduates, students enrolled in the  program may earn up to 12 points toward the M.A. by completing three  graduate courses in the Department of French or at the Institute of  French Studies. To earn advanced standing, these points may not be  counted toward an undergraduate degree, but must be in excess of the  128 points required for the B.A.      Under normal  circumstances, this can be achieved by students who register for the  maximum allowable number of points in their senior year. Earned in  this manner, advanced standing has the additional advantage of  enabling qualified students to start graduate work at an earlier  stage and in the most cost-efficient way.      Admission to the  program is open to students who have completed between 48 and 96  credits with a GPA of at least 3.5 and a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or  higher in the major. Application to the program can be made through  the director of undergraduate studies in French. Final acceptance  into the graduate sequence of the program is contingent on successful  completion of the B.A., formal admission into the Graduate School of  Arts and Science, and acceptance of the student's application. For  more information on the B.A./M.A. in French studies, please consult   www.ifs.as.nyu.edu/object/ifs.bama .        Facilities    The University has two  special facilities for students of French.      La Maison Fran\u00e7aise    This attractive house  in the old and picturesque Washington Mews is open to students of  French. It has a comfortable lounge, a small reading room opening  onto a terrace, and a soundproof music room. Programs of lectures and  recreational activities free to all students interested in French are  given here.      Institute of French  Studies    Adjacent to La Maison  Fran\u00e7aise in Washington Mews, the institute offers graduate courses  in contemporary French society and culture that are open to  undergraduates with special permission. The institute has a large  newspaper and periodical collection and a wide range of videotapes;  it also organizes frequent lectures and seminars by visiting  scholars, political personalities, and business and administrative  leaders from France.
