First, apply to NYU using the Common Application plus the NYU supplement. Second, schedule your artistic review. Once you have submitted your NYU application, you will receive a university-issued student NetID, along with a link to our online scheduler to make an artistic review appointment.    top What is the artistic review? The artistic review process allows us to determine if our program is an environment in which you will thrive, grow and progress toward achieving your goals in the theatre and in the world. \u2028\u2028 It\u2019s a little more than just an audition. For Acting candidates, the artistic review consists of an audition and a conversation with your evaluator. For Music Theatre candidates, we'll add some singing and dancing to your acting evaluation. For Directing candidates, it's an audition, a portfolio review and a conversation. For Production &amp; Design candidates, it's a portfolio review and a conversation.  top What materials should I submit for my artistic review? When you schedule your artistic review appointment, you will be asked to select one of four options: Acting, Music Theatre, Directing or Production and Design. After you\u2019ve made an appointment, you can return to the scheduler to provide us with the following materials by one week prior to your audition date \u2013 the earlier, the better\u2026 1. Photo 2. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 3. Information about your monologues, song selections or portfolios All applicants are required to submit a photo and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for their artistic review. A snapshot is preferable, as long as you are recognizable in the photo. Your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should contain all of your performing arts-related experience. You may include show credits (high school and college only) \u2013 onstage, backstage, design, directing, writing and producing; extracurricular, summer or community theater work; summer theater camp; vocal, dance or musical instrument training; competition participation or awards won; related arts work and accomplishments. You may also include community service, non-theater extra curricular activities and academic honors. Please use the proper format for a performing arts r\u00e9sum\u00e9. However, as this r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is part of your college application, it may be longer than one side of a page.  Your evaluator will not accept additional material beyond the photo and r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Please do not send DVDs, CDs, scripts, portfolios or any additional material to the Department of Drama. top How do I upload my artistic review materials? PHOTO: A snapshot is preferable, as long as you are recognizable in the photo. The file must be in JPEG format and must be less than 500 KB in size. Photo dimensions, for example, could be 240 x 360 pixels. RESUME: Your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should contain all of your performing arts-related experience, in addition to community service, non-theater extracurricular activities and academic honors. The file must be in PDF format and must be less than 1 MB in size. ARTISTIC REVIEW MATERIALS Acting, Music Theatre and Directing candidates must provide the following information about each monologue: Play Playwright Character Music Theatre candidates must also provide the following information about each song selection: Musical Composer/Lyricist Character Song Title Directing candidates must provide the following information about the portfolio presentation: Play Playwright Production &amp; Design candidates must name two areas of interest: Scenic Design Costume Design Sound Design Lighting Design Stage Management top Do you have any tips about the audition and conversation components of the artistic review? For the audition portion of the artistic review, please choose material appropriate for you. Our concern at the audition is your natural ability as a performer and how it would be served by the training we offer. Therefore, select monologues carefully (with characters that are close to your age and experience) to allow yourself to shine through the material. Opt for material that you are passionate about \u2013 that moves you emotionally or intellectually. The Department requests two contemporary monologues. We define \u201ccontemporary\u201d as anything written from around the turn of the 20th century to now. Be sure to read the entire play from which your monologue is taken. Monologues must be from published plays\u2013no film or TV scripts or original material. Each monologue must be under two minutes in length. You will have an opportunity to converse with your evaluator immediately after presenting your monologues. This is your time to tell us about yourself\u2013your background, interests, professional and academic goals. top If I want to be considered for the Music Theatre program, do I sing and dance at the artistic review? Yes. We should begin by saying studio placement is done by the Department of Drama. The Department has six acting studios and one music theatre studio that provide primary artistic training for our incoming students. If you choose a Music Theatre artistic review, we will consider you for placement in the music theatre studio first. If we feel you are a good fit, we will place you there. If not, we will automatically consider you for placement in one of the acting studios. When you make your artistic review appointment online, we will ask you if you would like to be considered for placement in all studios or only in the music theatre program. If Tisch Drama is your overriding objective, choose ALL STUDIOS. If you plan to pursue an undergraduate course of study solely in musical theatre, you might consider choosing MUSIC THEATRE ONLY. Please keep in mind, however, that if you choose MUSIC THEATRE ONLY but we do not feel you are a good fit for the music theatre program, you will not be considered for any acting studios nor will you be accepted into NYU. \u2028\u2028 The Department of Drama at Tisch offers a range of programs where musical skills are viewed as an essential element of an actor\u2019s expressive vocabulary. Our most concentrated music theatre program is offered through the New Studio on Broadway, but students attend voice, music and dance classes throughout the Department and participate in full-length musicals at other studios, including Playwrights Horizons, Strasberg and ETW. At least one musical is traditionally chosen as a core element of the Department\u2019s produced season and the departmental curriculum offers cabaret classes, which culminate in produced final projects. Also, countless music theatre and cabaret performances are staged by Drama students both in student-produced productions and as part of the directing program at Playwrights Horizons Theater School. top Can I do an Acting artistic review AND a Music Theatre artistic review? No. You may only choose one area of concentration for your artistic review. If you participate in an Acting artistic review, you will be considered for placement in one of the six acting studios for your primary training. You will not be considered for the music theatre program at the New Studio on Broadway, our most concentrated music theatre training. \u2028 If you do a Music Theatre artistic review, you will be considered first for placement in the music theatre program at the New Studio on Broadway. If we feel you are a good fit, we will place you there. If not, we will consider you for placement in one of the acting studios. top Do I have to audition in New York City? Early Decision and Early Decision II candidates must audition in New York. \u2028\u2028 Regular Decision candidates have the option of attending an artistic review in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta and Miami. Transfer candidates may audition in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.        top Can I submit my artistic review digitally? If you cannot attend an in-person artistic review, a digital artistic review may be submitted, but you must follow specific guidelines. Submissions that do not strictly follow these guidelines will not be considered.  Please understand that while digital artistic reviews are weighed the same as in-person artistic reviews, they are more difficult to evaluate. Only use the digital submission option if you cannot make it to one of the artistic review locations for an in-person artistic review or in the event that all available appointments have been filled. You must submit your NYU application before you will be permitted to make a digital submission appointment. The digital submission appointment is actually a three-hour session during which your evaluator will contact you via phone or Skype to have a brief conversation. You must be available for the full session. In addition to reserving a digital submission session in our online scheduler, you will be asked to upload your monologues, songs or portfolio material to SlideRoom (instructions can be found on our Digital Submission page). Once an evaluator has reviewed your artistic review material, he or she will contact you by Skype for the conversation portion of your artistic review. top If I am not accepted Early Decision, can I reapply during Regular Decision? No. Early Decision and Early Decision II candidates receive a final decision letter from NYU. If you are not accepted, you may reapply as a Transfer candidate the following year. top If I am not accepted into the Department of Drama, can I be admitted into another school at NYU? By checking a box on the Common Application, you may indicate your interest in allowing NYU Admissions to consider you for other schools, colleges or programs at NYU if the committee does not feel that you meet the qualifications for Tisch. Please check the NYU Admissions website for further information. top Can my drama teacher write me a recommendation letter? No. NYU  Undergraduate Admissions requires two letters of recommendation: one from an  academic teacher and one from a guidance counselor. The Department of  Drama does not require an artistic recommendation, as we are evaluating your  natural ability as an artist through the artistic review. Letters from artistic teachers and  mentors will not be accepted during the admissions process.       top Can I sit in on a class? No. The Department of  Drama does not arrange for prospective students to watch classes.   Studio work is of a sensitive nature and is not set up for  observation.   top Do you offer summer programs for high school students? Yes. Please visit the Tisch Summer High School Program website for further information. top I am an international applicant. Is there anything special I need to know? If you are unable to travel to the United States for your artistic review, you are welcome to submit a digital artistic review, as explained above. Visit the website of NYU\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Admissions for information about the NYU application for international students. top Can I visit the Department of Drama? If you are planning to visit NYU, you are encouraged to attend a Department of Drama information session. The Department holds info sessions twice a week throughout most of the year, on Mondays and Fridays at noon. Sessions are held at Tisch Student Affairs, 726 Broadway, Second Floor.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.
