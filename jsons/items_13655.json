As a bridge to understand our global and local surroundings through a different set of lens than what we are generally used to seeing, both generational and gender-wise, the Institute of African American Affairs at New York University presents a year-long series of conversations with young diasporic women of African descent writing new visions of the world. By charting their own spaces and territories, they introduce a new creativity that recasts issues of style, gender and transformation. Their works go beyond the literature strictly about and reserved for women; their own powerful voices to the social, political and literary arts landscapes becomes critical. As we enter the second decade of a young century terms such as \u201cdiaspora\u201d \u201cgender\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d are not so discrete and easily categorized. The ways that women writers of African descent have defined and expressed themselves globally have always been complex and pose challenges not just for the writer but for audiences as well. A younger generation has had to contend with overlapping modernities and transnational migrations which have complicated the meanings of certain terms, identities and experiences. It prompts us to rethink the geographical boundaries and conceptual paradigms surrounding the production of cultural knowledge from these women writers and their diasporic communities. What are the new questions and challenges posed by their works via both the personal and the public? What does it mean to write from that perspective and explore various themes both within and outside the prescribed category of gender and race? How do cultural linkages and the notion of national origin factor in writing and reading within and outside these \u201cboundaries?\u201d Whether by personal choice or imposed, do these categories suggest an influence that is usually thought of either outside or against the mainstream? What are the processes that permit or discourage changes in our understanding of the kinds of writing these women produce? Scholars, artists, critics, students and the general public are invited for a dialogue and exchange of views with these women writers in conversations on the importance of their writings and cultural contributions in today\u2019s world.

Diamond Sefi Atta  moderated by Rich Blint, Ph.D. candidate, NYU, American Studies Time: 6:30 pm Location: Institute of African American Affairs, NYU 41 East 11th Street, 7th Floor New York, NY 10003 Free &amp; Open to the Public Limited Space Please RSVP to (212) 998-IAAA (4222)          Marilyn Heward Mills was born in Switzerland and brought up in Ghana. Her first novel, Cloth Girl , was shortlisted for the Costa First Novel Award. It is set in the Gold Coast at the end of British rule and tells the story of Matilda, who is fourteen when her childhood is ended by her marriage to Robert, a lawyer who already has a wife and children. Matilda is a 'cloth girl', the term used derogatively to describe women who wore traditional cloth (a blouse with a piece of fabric wrapped around the waist as a skirt). Mills\u2019 second book, The Association of Foreign Spouses , is set in Ghana in the turbulent eighties and is a story of love and friendship, betrayal and forgiveness. It is the story of a group of women who live in a land that at times defeats them, among people who often disappoint and baffle them. Through their trials and hardships, the women support each other, unified by their foreignness, their distance from home and the choices they have made, as ultimately they are wooed by this strange place that they come to call home. She was a practicing lawyer for over nine years, and now lives in South London.         LYDIA R.
