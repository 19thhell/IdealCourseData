Description.     Domestic political circumstances affect the policy incentives of leaders. Hence domestic political institutions, economic performance and popularity all influence foreign policy. In turn, international outcomes influence the domestic survival of leaders. This seminar explores the theoretical linkages between domestic and international events. During the seminar we will focus on the theoretical explanations and the empirical evidence used to support these hypotheses. The readings should be considered in this light. Rather than simply reading each work at face value, a primary goal is uncovering the exact relationship that each author characterizes and then to evaluate whether the evidence supports or falsifies their claims          Requirements and grading        All students are expected to come to class and have done the readings. In addition students are expected to present the readings. Although the number of reading will vary with the exact enrolment, I envision that students should expect to present two or three times during the semester. These presentations should take the form of a 10 to15 minutes summary of the reading. Presentations should include consideration of the following questions: 1) What does the author seek to explain (the dependent variable)? 2) How does he or she measure this dependent variable? 3) What is the authors explanation for the variance in the dependent variable? 4) What predictions does the author generate (the relationship between independent, or explanatory, variables and the dependent variable)? 5) What evidence would support the authors predictions? What would falsify them? 6) What evidence does the author provide?       In addition to these presentations, students are expected to write a term paper and 5 additional think pieces. These think pieces should be around 2 pages long and discuss how the research in the readings could be improved or extended. They should not be a simple summary. However, beyond these criteria students are free to write on any topic they wish. The term paper should represent further developments of a think piece. As you will note in the schedule, I have left one session free for students to present their ideas for their term paper. For this class students should prepare a brief summary and be prepared to present their idea for about 10mins. I hope this session will provide valuable feedback and help sharpen projects.        The term paper is due in my mailbox in 726 Broadway (7 th floor) by 12 noon on Wednesday May 14th. This deadline is final and non-negotiable. Late papers will result in a grade F. The think pieces should be given to me at the start of the relevant class (preferably a few hours earlier so that I have an opportunity to read them before class). You may only write one think piece per week (Warning: do not leave the think pieces until the end of the semester. You cannot write 5 papers in 4 weeks).          The final paper represents 40% of the overall grade, think pieces make up 30% (i.e., 6% each) of the final grade and presentations account for remaining 30%.

Description.     Domestic political circumstances affect the policy incentives of leaders. Hence domestic political institutions, economic performance and popularity all influence foreign policy. In turn, international outcomes influence the domestic survival of leaders. This seminar explores the theoretical linkages between domestic and international events. During the seminar we will focus on the theoretical explanations and the empirical evidence used to support these hypotheses. The readings should be considered in this light. Rather than simply reading each work at face value, a primary goal is uncovering the exact relationship that each author characterizes and then to evaluate whether the evidence supports or falsifies their claims          Requirements and grading        All students are expected to come to class and have done the readings. In addition students are expected to present the readings. Although the number of reading will vary with the exact enrolment, I envision that students should expect to present two or three times during the semester. These presentations should take the form of a 10 to15 minutes summary of the reading. Presentations should include consideration of the following questions: 1) What does the author seek to explain (the dependent variable)? 2) How does he or she measure this dependent variable? 3) What is the authors explanation for the variance in the dependent variable? 4) What predictions does the author generate (the relationship between independent, or explanatory, variables and the dependent variable)? 5) What evidence would support the authors predictions? What would falsify them? 6) What evidence does the author provide?       In addition to these presentations, students are expected to write a term paper and 5 additional think pieces. These think pieces should be around 2 pages long and discuss how the research in the readings could be improved or extended. They should not be a simple summary. However, beyond these criteria students are free to write on any topic they wish. The term paper should represent further developments of a think piece. As you will note in the schedule, I have left one session free for students to present their ideas for their term paper. For this class students should prepare a brief summary and be prepared to present their idea for about 10mins. I hope this session will provide valuable feedback and help sharpen projects.        The term paper is due in my mailbox in 726 Broadway (7 th floor) by 12 noon on Wednesday May 14th. This deadline is final and non-negotiable. Late papers will result in a grade F. The think pieces should be given to me at the start of the relevant class (preferably a few hours earlier so that I have an opportunity to read them before class). You may only write one think piece per week (Warning: do not leave the think pieces until the end of the semester. You cannot write 5 papers in 4 weeks).          The final paper represents 40% of the overall grade, think pieces make up 30% (i.e., 6% each) of the final grade and presentations account for remaining 30%.

Syllabus : [ Stevens F07 ][ Stevens F08 ] [ Acikgoz S13 ]          POL-UA 810 - Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. In this course, the tools of economic theory, game theory, and social-choice theory will be applied to the rational-choice analysis of political, economic, and social institutions, whose consequences for society will be derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. The product of such analysis, which is reflected in the title of this course, is normative: To design institutions that meet certain \u201cengineering\u201d specifications and, therefore, may be superior to institutions that, because they arose more haphazardly, may not satisfy these specifications. Like engineering in the natural sciences, which translates theory (e.g., from physics) into practical design (e.g., a bridge), engineering in the social sciences translates rational-choice analysis into the design of better political-economic-social institutions.    Syllabus : [ Brams S05 ] [ Brams S11 ]          POL-UA 812- Introduction to Political Psychology This course offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. The course introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics.    Syllabus: [ Dickson F08 ]          POL-UA 840 -- Introduction to Game Theory This course introduces the basic concepts of elementary game theory in a way that allows you to use them in solving simple problems. And second, it gives a flavor of how game theory can be used in the study of political science by presenting a wide array of example applications. In addition, throughout the course we will discuss evidence from experiments and from other sources that bears on when we should expect game theory to be most useful in applied studies, and when we might reasonably have doubts about the types of predictions that it makes about human behavior. Syllabus : [ Hafer F14 ]       POL-UA 842 -- Doing Political Economy    Political economy has made great strides in recent year in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this class is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. First students are introduced to the tools of modern political economy. In a relatively non-mathematical manner students will also learn the conceptual basis of statistical testing. These tools are then applied to policy problems in three substantive areas: international relations, American politics and comparative politics. Through these methods and their application students will learn how to evaluate public policy using theory and evidence. Syllabus : [ Smith F10 ]          POL-UA 844 - Games, Strategy, and Politics Theories of political strategy, with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and negotiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strategies and uses of power, with some applications outside political science.    Syllabus : [ Brams F13 ]          POL-UA 845 - Social Choice and Politics Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals'politics.ug.coursedescriptions voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions. The emphasis is analytical, though students are not expected to have a background in formal mathematics.    Syllabus : [Eguia F07] [ Eguia F11 ]          POL-UA 846 - Experimental Methods in Political Science    Prerequisite: POL-UA 800 This course is designed to provide an introduction to experimental methods in political science for undergraduate students. The emphasis of the course will be on several different styles of laboratory experiments, but field experiments (and briefly, survey experiments) will also be discussed.

Syllabus - [ Browne F12 ]                     Political Theory           POL-UA 100 - Political Theory (Core Course) This course is an introduction to the history of political theory. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. Despite the age of some of the texts with which we will wrestle, the purpose of the course is not exclusively historical. Instead, part of the reason that these texts are widely seen as classics is because they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. It is through the categories created and clarified by these thinkers that we conceptualize, understand, and assess our political lives. Syllabus : [ Kates Sum10 ] [ Pevnick S11 ]          POL-UA 110 - Topics in Premodern Political Philosophy Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Intensive introduction to the major themes of Western political thought through a careful analysis of classical and medieval works. Among the authors studied are Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, and St. Thomas Aquinas. Formerly Political Thought from Plato to Machiavelli.          POL-UA 120 - Modern Political Thought: 1500 to the Present Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche.          POL-UA 120 - Nietzsche and the 20th Century In Germany in the twentieth century, Nietzsche was revered by Zionists, anti-Semites, German nationalists, cosmopolitans, conservatives, anarchists, royalists, atheists and the religious. Who was this figure who managed to inspire such contradictory adherents?   We begin by examining Nietzsche\u2019s work so that we can come to some understanding of who he was. Then we look at how, and why, he influenced so many of the major thinkers of the twentieth century. The course is designed to offer students a new way to think about modernity, modern political thought, and the century from which we have just escaped. Classes will be devoted to detailed discussions of the readings.  Syllabus: [ O'Brien ]           POL-UA 130 -- Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy This course will provide students the ability systematically to evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts from normative political theory. We consider four overarching questions: Should public officials be responsible to universal laws of morality? By what criteria do we evaluate the ends of public policy? Are the intentions and internal psychological state of the public official morally relevant? How do we evaluate moral choices when outcomes depend on the decisions of more than one individual? In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to \"do bad in order to do good?\" In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Topics for this semester include the decision to drop the atomic bomb in World War II, the treatment of terrorist suspects, lying in office, racial profiling, the analysis of environmental policy, health care allocation, social welfare policy, capital punishment, international intervention in humanitarian crises, and collective responsibility in office.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S05 ]         POL-UA 138- Theories of Justice Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 This course is an undergraduate-level introduction to the subject of justice in contemporary Anglo-American political theory. Its aim is to provide students with an understanding of the current state of the theoretical literature on justice as well as to enable them to engage in their own critical thinking about the topic. For the most part, discussion proceeds in chronological order. We begin with the study of utilitarianism\u2014the dominant approach to political philosophy in the modern era. From there we proceed to a thorough treatment of the political philosopher who has, arguably, dominated the contemporary scene: John Rawls. In particular, we shall examine the arguments put forward in A Theory of Justice for what he calls \u201cjustice as fairness\u201d\u2014a conception of justice that he believed to be superior to that articulated by utilitarians. But in developing his own distinctively contractarian conception of justice, Rawls was, however, subject to much criticism. For that reason, we turn next to a variety of alternative conceptions of justice put forward in direct contrast to his position: namely, libertarianism, luck egalitarianism and the capabilities approach, Marxism, communitarianism, and, finally, feminism.    In the latter half of the course we focus on a number of related problems that have been at issue in contemporary discussions of justice. More specifically, we explore the question of whether principles of justice apply solely within the boundaries of particular states or whether their application is global in scope instead. Next, we consider whether principles of justice fix our relations with our contemporaries alone or whether they further constrain our actions towards future generations as well. In a related manner, we also ask how, if at all, justice constrains our relations with non-human animals. We end, finally, by considering whether justice and democracy conflict, and, if so, which ought to receive priority in practical political action.    Syllabus : [ Kates S11 ]          POL-UA 140 - Socialist Theory Concentrates on those socialist schools-Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism-that have proved to be the most successful. Aims to present their major theories and to examine the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live.    Syllabus : [ Ollman F07 ] [ Ollman F10 ]          POL-UA 150 - Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 This course will focus on ways to understand nationalism and ethnic identification and the conflict that they sometimes stimulate. Readings will be from varied perspectives. This course is a discussion seminar.    Syllabus : [ Hardin S07 ]           POL-UA 160 - Democracy and Dictatorship Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship.    Syllabus : [ Erbal Sum07 ]          POL-UA 170 - American Political Thought 4 points -- Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present. Topics include Puritanism, revolution and independence, the Constitution framing, Hamiltonian nationalism, Jeffersonian republicanism, Jacksonian democracy, pro- and antislavery thought, Civil War and Reconstruction, Social Darwinism and laissez-faire, the reformist thought of populism, progressivism and socialism, legal realism, the New Deal and 20th-century liberalism, modern conservatism, civil rights, and war protest. Readings and discussion are based on original and interpretative sources.          POL-UA 195 - Undergraduate Field Seminar: Political Theory Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in political theory. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.    Syllabus : Constitution-Making [ Pasquino F07 ]    Justice [ Hardin S07 ]    Dialectical Methodology [ Ollman S07 ]    Contemporary Democratic Theory [ Pevnick F09 ], [ Pevnick F10 ][ Pevnick S13 ]    Theories of Justice [ Pevnick S10 ][ Pevnick S13 ]          POL-UA 994 - Law and Courts    The general topic of the lectures will be the role of the judicial power in constitutional democracies. Notwithstanding the well know increasing role of courts in our societies political theory doesn't pay enough attention to the judicial power in the institutional structure of the separation of powers. The course will start from considering and analyzing the classical doctrine of the separation of powers (Locke, Montesquieu, J. Madison, A. Hamilton, the anti-federalist Brutus, A. Bergasse) in order to identify the limits of it concerning the role assigned to the judiciary. We will moreover consider the general theory if the judicial institutions from Aristotle to Coke, Hobbes and to the contemporary debates (the Scandinavian School, M. Shapiro, P. Stein).The last section of the course will be devoted to Supreme/Constitutional Courts and to the new balance of powers in the contemporary world.    Syllabus :           POL-UA 994 - The Constitution in the Age of Terror Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course will examine in depth the legal, moral, social and political context for counter-terrorism. It will attempt to frame issues of strategy and policy within the moral tradition of just war doctrine and the constitutional values embraced by the Supreme Court of the United States and the international courts in the Nuremberg tradition. We will read widely in journalism, philosophy, policy and law, with a number of classes devoted to court decisions.    Syllabus : [ Gerety S07 ]          POL-UA 994 - Law and Morality in the Age of Terror Prerequisite: POL-UA 100   This course seeks to deepen our understanding of the law and policy of counter-terrorism by approaching the challenges of terrorist attacks from several points of view. Notably, we will deploy moral philosophy, international and domestic law, social science--and of course policy studies , including arguments over institutional arrangements. Over the semester we will examine a variety of cases and hypotheses, touching on such matters as interrogation and torture, killing and assassination, detention and trial.  If the student has taken a course in AD that has been approved as equivalent to the POL-UA 100, can we issue a permission code, or would you prefer to do so.    Syllabus : [ Gerety S11 ]          POL-UA 994 - Religion and Politics Our focus in this course will be on the relationship between Christianity and liberal democracy in the modern era. In part one, we will read texts from the modern liberal canon with the intention of understanding the differing modes of engagement with religion, we will see that this has entailed neutrality, rejection, or an embrace whether warm or stifling. None of these approaches have been wholly successful, or a complete failure. In part two, we look at Nietzsche\u2019s claim that God is \u201cdead\u201d and see how this claim has been used, and abused, by subsequent thinkers. Overall, the course will offer students a new way to think about the evolving relationship between religion and politics and the ways in which it shapes our lives..

The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. Looks at the operations of the government in the terms Washingtonians use. Examines the roles of Congress and the bureaucracy; the procedures of budgeting and regulatory agencies; and the issues in several concrete areas of policy, mainly in the domestic area. Excellent preparation for students planning to take the Washington Semester Program.

Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies.    Syllabus : [ Kim S07 ]          POL-UA 311 - The Biology of Politics    Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? Why do individuals have the political attitudes they do? These questions are central to the study of politics. Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, mobilization, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. However, scholars have recently begun to explore the possibility that biological differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political attitudes and behavior. This course explores the relationship between biology and political behavior with an emphasis on how the two may be linked.    Syllabus : [ Dawes S12 ] [ Dawes S13 ]          POL-UA 315 - Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence This course is about using logic to think about issues of public policy and evidence to do the same thing. One way to think about this course is it is sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, and in Moneyball) applied to vastly more important topics than baseball: making schools better, designing health policy and dealing with climate change (with tons of other policy applications possible, but we will focus on these three).    Syllabus: [ Beck S13 ]          POL-UA 320 - Congress and Legislative Assemblies Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States.

POL-UA 330 - The American Constitution This course examines the major contours of the American Constitution excluding the Bill of Rights. We will discuss constitutional law in the broader framework of social and political philosophy and explore evolution of judicial doctrine through our constitutional history. The two major themes that run through most of the cases are federalism and separation of powers.    Syllabus : [Kawar F07] [ Rajsingh S07 ] [ Harrington F06 ] [ Rajsingh S11 ]          POL-UA 332 - Civil Liberties Interpretation of the Bill of Rights, the Civil War Amendments, and other rights in the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions.

Specifically, the primary focus of the course is on why the Justices decide cases in the way that they do. However, we will also look at the Justices\ufffd decisions on writs of certiorari, and at the process by which the Justices are nominated and confirmed to the Court.    Syllabus : [ Harvey S07 ]          POL-UA 334 - American Law and Legal System Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Introduction to law and the legal system through the reading of actual cases.

POL-UA 335 - Law and Society Identical to V62.0001 and V18.0722 This course studies the relationship between law and society by studying the nature of \u201crights\u201d and \u201crights claims.\u201d The topics will address many issues and debates, but we will focus particularly on several main questions. What are the different theoretical bases for rights claims? How does the law impact what rights individuals and groups in civil society fight for, and the way they frame their claims? What happens when different rights claims conflict with one another? What is the difference between a right and a policy preference, and how do those different classifications affect discourse and public policy?    Syllabus : [ Harrington F10 ] [ Ferri S11 ]          POL-UA 336 - Gender in Law    Identical to V18.0723 Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, also addresses to what extent understandings of the gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. Syllabus : [ Harrington S10 ]          POL-UA 337 - The Rule of Law    The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology. This seminar explores the theory surrounding the rule of law ideal. It focuses on the political conditions that promote the rule of law as well as on the challenges to the rule of law in time of emergencies. Topics include the connection between law and morality, the political foundation of the rule of law, the interaction among political institutions in promoting or subverting the rule of law, the rule of law in times of crisis, the eects of emergency powers on the rule of law, and the rule of law and terrorism prevention. Syllabus : [ Dragu S13 ]          POL-UA 340 - Political Parties Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Background, structure, operation, and definition of the party systems. Development of the two-party system in the United States from its origins to the present. Formal organization of parties on the national and state levels and control of the parties within the state. Party politics in the South, political machines, ethnic politics, nominations for public office, and pressure groups on the party system. The national election from first stirrings of potential candidates through the general election.          POL-UA 342 - American Public Opinion Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 What do Americans think about politics? Why do they hold these beliefs? And does it matter? This course grapples with these three questions, which lie at the core of our understanding of the health of American democratic society. In doing so, the class will give students the tools they need to critically assess the construction, conduct, and reporting of public opinion surveys.    Syllabus : [ Egan F07 ] [ Egan F08 ] [ Egan F10 ] [ Egan S13 ]          POL-UA 344 The Election Process Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Provides an understanding of election processes in the United States through different theoretical approaches to the study of campaigns and elections and the testing of empirical hypotheses.

Syllabus : [ Morton F06 ] [ Nagler S10 ]          POL-UA 350 - Bureaucracy and Public Policy Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. In this course, we will examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we will draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S07 ]          POL-UA 353 - The Military and                Defense in American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Role of the military establishment in the exercise of power and in contemporary American politics.

Evolution of local party organizations, the rise and fate of party \"bosses,\" and the predicament of the ordinary citizen in the urban community. Patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community. Conceptions of effective leadership in urban politics and the role of the police, the press, and \"good government\" groups in local political life.          POL-UA 380 Minority Representation in American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course is an exploration of whether and how racial and ethnic minorities are able to organize effectively and press their demands through the American political system. Specifically, we will focus on the political behavior of minority citizens, the relative strength and effect of these groups at the polls and in political office, the theory and practice of group formation as it applies to minority groups, the responsiveness of elected officials, and the legal and constitutional obstacles and instruments that provide context and shape these phenomena. As this course is also part of the Alexander Hamilton Center for Political Economy we focus primarily on how different public policies can be used to enhance or reduce minority representation in American politics. We examine how public policies can affect both descriptive and substantive representation.    Syllabus : [ Morton F06 ] [ Morton S08 ]          POL-UA 382 - The Politics of Poverty and Welfare Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Poverty and welfare problems in the United States and the controversies aroused by them. Concentrates on the causes of poverty and dependency among the controversial working-age poor, the history of programs and policies meant to help them, and the enormous impact these issues have had on national politics.    Syllabus : [ Mead S10 ]          POL-UA 385 - Political Economy: The United States in Comparative Perspective Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 or POL-UA 500 This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including the politics of economic reform, party systems and voting, theories of ethnic politics, and social capital.    Students in the Alexander Hamilton Institute honors sections will also focus on how the lessons of rigorous political science can be used to inform public policy decisions.    Syllabus : [ Tucker S09 ]          POL-UA 395 - Undergraduate Field Seminar: American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in American politics. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each semester.    Syllabus : Congressional Elections [ Nagler F13 ]    The Politics of Judicial Decision Making [ Harvey S07 ]    Minority Representation in American Politics [ Morton S07 ]    Welfare Politics [ Mead S05 ]       Spring 2011 Seminars:    Interest Groups We will be examining the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the difficulty of demonstrating influence empirically despite the \"you know it when you see it\" flavor of contemporary journalistic accounts.    Congressional Elections and Competitiveness    A prominent fact of congressional elections in the United States is the frequency with which they are won by incumbents. The lack of competition in these elections will be the focus of this course. To understand this lack of competition we will cover considerable ground: the basic facts of re-election rates, the amount of money spent by incumbents and challengers, and the nature of congressional districts. We will also cover existing theories and evidence about the behavior of voters that maintains so many incumbents in o ce: including the impact of issues, the impact of campaign spending, and whether or not voters have become more polarized. We will also look at the extent to which congressional elections are decided by national forces versus conditions peculiar to the individual race (see 1994, 2006, 2010). In trying to understand why congressional elections have become so uncompetitive we will look at possible reforms to increase competitiveness. We will also consider the impact of the behavior of the major parties on the competitiveness of elections, and examine how changes in party strategies could lead to more competitive elections. Syllabus: [ Nagler S11 ]          POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Politics and Finance Prerequisites: POL-UA 300, three other politics courses, Junior or Senior standing, 3.5 GPA and one course in Economics. This seminar examines how legislation and regulation influences the structure of financial markets and how players in these markets intervene in the political process to create or modify legislative and regulatory outcomes. Particular emphasis will be placed on the United States. International comparisons will also be present. The class will assume that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory will be provided. The approach will be similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions will be made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.    Syllabus : [ Rosenthal F10 ] [ Rosenthal F11 ]        POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Politics and Courts    Prerequisites: POL-UA 300 and three other politics courses, 3.5 GPA This seminar will examine the question of judicial independence. Our two primary questions are: Are federal courts in the United States independent of the elected branches? Should they be? We will read secondary and primary sources, the latter including both judicial opinions and quantitative data, and talk about how one might answer these questions. We will also look at state courts, and at how courts function in other countries. Students will write brief weekly responses to the readings, as well as develop a research paper on the question of judicial independence.    Syllabus : [ Harvey S11 ]          POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Slavery, Inequality, and the Constitution    This seminar will explore recent work on the growth and causes of income inequality in the United States. We will particularly focus on the role of political institutions in contributing to or lessening income inequality. We will also examine the choices made in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and consider the consequences of those choices for the later growth of income inequality in the United States. Finally, we will read recent work on the effects of colonial-era inequality, including the institution of slavery, on later constitutional choices. We will read secondary work, both qualitative and quantitative, and explore currently available datasets. Students will write weekly response papers and will complete a final research paper.   POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Political Economy of Inequality    Over the past four decades, the United States has experienced dramatic increases in economic inequality, political polarization, and the percentage of the population that is foreign born. It has experienced a dramatic decrease in market regulation, especially financial markets. The seminar will investigate how these major changes in American society tie together. We will seek to understand why the increase in inequality has not been counterbalanced by a political process that would lead to more taxation and more redistribution. In particular, we will ask why, after the financial crisis of 2007-08 was ruinous for millions of Americans, Congress moved sharply to the right with the rise of the Tea Party and the Republican success in the midterm elections of 2010. Syllabus: [ Rosenthal F13 ]  POL-UA 341: Private Influence in Public Policy    In this course, we will examine the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, and the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the overcoming the challenges associated with demonstrating influence empirically.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S13 ]                    Comparative Politics           POL-UA 500 - Comparative Politics (Core Course) We study politics in a comparative context, not as a form of intellectual tourism, but to broaden and deepen our understanding of important and general political processes. We do this by making systematic comparisons between political systems that are similar in many respects, but nonetheless differ in important ways. This allows us to analyze the effect of these differences in a careful and rigorous way, enriching our understanding of how politics works. The philosophy of this course is thus to concentrate on a group of developed countries that are similar in many important ways, seeking to analyze core features of representative democracy by making systematic comparisons between countries. (Other courses in comparative politics offered by the department focus more on developing countries.)    Syllabus : [ Tucker F10 ] [ Laver S06 ] [ Laver S10 ] [ Tucker F11 ]          POL-UA 505 Elections and Voting Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 or POL-UA 500 Perhaps no other political activity is as important for public policy in democratic (and even quasi-democratic) countries as voting and elections, which determine who the ultimate policy makers will be. Thus if we ever hope to understand why governments produce the policies they do, we have to begin by asking why people vote the way they do. Why do certain parties and candidates lose elections, while others win? How important is the economy in influencing election results? And why do some people choose not to vote at all? As democracy in its various forms spreads across the globe, more and more people are voting. In response, this course studies elections and voting as a truly international phenomenon. Topics closely related to voting and elections - such as political parties, electoral rules and systems, and partisan identification - are explored as well. Students will also use to learn political science methods based on logic and evidence to explore competing explanations for these and other questions.    Syllabus : [ Tucker S07 ]          POL-UA 510 - Western European Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Identical to V42.0510 Study of the politics of Britain, Ireland, France, and the German Federal Republic.

Since the early 1960s immigration has transformed European countries into multi-racial and multi-ethnic societies. We will first explore how public policy contributed to this transformation, how it was structured by different concepts, traditions and laws on citizenship, and how it was related to transformation of the party system and the emergence of the extreme right and \u201cidentity politics\u201d in Western Europe.    Syllabus : [ Schain S07 ]          POL-UA 512 - Italian Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective.

POL-UA 530 - Politics of Latin America This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development. Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world? Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada? Why did so many countries fell to dictatorship in the 20th Century? Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order? How does democracy perform in Latin America? Why have some Latin American countries performed better than others? What are the challenges for Latin America into the future? The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. The course will focus on institutional theories, but we will also discuss alternative theories. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism, amongst others. In doing so, we will study differences as well as commonalities across different Latin American countries.    Syllabus : [ C.

Syllabus : [ Zubida F05 ]          POL-UA 584 - Contemporary African Politics This course offers an introduction to contemporary African politics. Our goal is to introduce students to the most pressing problems African countries have faced since independence. Questions motivating the course include: (1) Why state institutions weaker in African than in other developing regions? (2) What explains Africa's slow economic growth? (3) What can be done to improve political accountability on the continent? (4) Why have some African countries been plagued by high levels of political violence while others have not? (5) Can or should the West attempt to \"save\" Africa?    The course is structured in three parts. In the first, we will review Africa's recent political history, concentrating on the impacts of colonialism, and the types of states created in the wake of African independence movements. Then we turn to the challenges post-colonial governments face as they attempt to manage the interests of ethnically diverse societies, and reform their economies and political institutions. We end the course with an in-depth look at patterns of violent conflict across Africa, and the daunting tasks that many African countries face as they attempt to recover from conflict.    Syllabus : [ Scacco S11]          POL-UA 994- Political and Bureaucratic Corruption Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Political and bureaucratic corruption affects the quality of public policy, and indirectly the well-being of millions of people. Empirical evidence shows that corruption slows economic development, biases government expenditures, and reinforces income inequality. What do political science and economics know about the phenomenon? This course surveys the recent literature on the political economy of corruption. Theoretical and empirical perspectives are introduced. Corruption can be understood as the collusion between special interests and politicians, against citizens. Possible causes (cultural traditions, the design of political institutions, the distribution of resources in a society) and motives (e.g., private greed, the need to finance political parties) are explored. Some attention is also paid to the possible solutions: transparency, electoral accountability, a free media market, independent prosecutors, and better pay for public servants.

Syllabus : Politics and Economics of Institutions [ Eggertsson S08 ]    Political Economy of Institutions [ Hafer S07 ]    Comparative Political Economy [ Stasavage S06 ]    Civil Wars and Negotiated Settlements [ Wood F03 ]    Topics in African Politics [ Wantchekon F08 ]       Comparative Political Economy of Affirmative Action [Samii F12]      Old and New Left in Latin America [ Castaneda F13 ]                          POL-UA 595.01 - The Politics of Inequality Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Students in this seminar will investigate how inequality shapes politics and  how politics shapes inequality, both in the advanced industrial countries  and the developing world. In the first half of the course students will  review recent work on long run trends in inequality in the industrialized  world, investigate the political factors that may have influenced these  trends, and finally examine how changes in inequality have shaped the  pattern of politics, with particular emphasis on the current US context.  The second half of the course will focus more specifically on inequality in  the developing world and its relationship to democracy, political violence,  and economic development. Syllabus : [ Stasavage F11]           POL-UA 596 - Honors Seminar: Comparative Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500, three other politics courses, Junior or Senior standing, 3.5 GPA. Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in comparative politics. The specific topic of this seminar is announced each year.    Syllabus : Ethnic Identity Politics and Democracy [ Chandra F07 ]       POL-UA 597 - Networks and Politics Are segregated neighborhoods always the result of discrimination? If a revolution is brewing, how many people must the revolutionaries personally recruit in order to incite widespread revolution? How debilitating will a snowed-in JFK Airport be to national air travel? Why are all actors separated from Kevin Bacon by 6 degrees or fewer? Why did Blu-Ray dominate HD DVD? The budding new field of Network Analysis offers the tools to answer questions like these. Network analysis is a recent import into the social sciences, and has been developed in a diverse set of fields, from physics to computer science to sociology. Recognizing that objects of study (people, genes, web pages, virus hosts, etc.) are often influenced by \u2018neighboring\u2019 objects of study, these fields have created a paradigm and a set of tools that political scientists can use to study segregation, the spread of ideas, learning, institutional design, the adoption of new technologies, epidemics, migration, trade, revolutions, and various other phenomena that involve a group of people interacting. The blend of networks and political science covered in this course will reveal a wealth of untapped research opportunities and chances to make real contributions to the field of political science. This course assumes no background in social network analysis; we will begin with the basics. By the end of the course, you will have the skills necessary to explain or make predictionsabout real world political phenomena using network techniques. You will also develop the invaluable skill of extracting meaning from academic articles that assume a level oftechnical proficiency above your own\u2014a skill that will serve you well in academia, the world of consulting, and beyond.

POL-UA 994 - Causes and Consequences of Globalization \"Globalization\" is a conceptual stand-in for highly complex, interdependent interactions between economies, polities, cultures, and almost all other national-level social constructs. Globalization has accrued a mass of de nitions and interpretations which cannot be reconciled easily (if at all) with one another as a result of its multifaceted nature. We will consequently focus on only two of globalization's faces\" in this course: economic and political globalization. After wrestling the with de ning and understanding the concept globalization, the course will be divided into two parts. The rst part of the course focuses on understanding and analyzing the causes and e ects of economic globalization, i.e. the increased interconnectedness of national and regional economies via lowered trade barriers, intensfi ed nancial ows, and increased labor mobility. We consider previous eras of globalization and theories of economic growth that inform arguments for increased globalization, focusing on the economics of neo-instutionalism. We spend a week each on trade liberalization, capital ows, and the role of multinational corporations in the international economy. We end the rst part of the course with a discussion of the domestic sects of globalization. The second part of the course turns to the globalization of political ideas as well as the s ects of the globalized economy on political outcomes. Again, we revisit the past and consider the role of economic growth and the dissemination of ideas in understanding political order. We cover both regime transitions nd stability in the face of economic shocks. We then analyze the role of national political competition in furthering or abating globalization. We then turn towards the e ects of an older era of globalization|the colonial period|onmore current political phenomena. We nish the course with the consequences of democracy promotion in the developing world.
