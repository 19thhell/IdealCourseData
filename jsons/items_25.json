[{"detail": [{"content": "Part 6: The Artist's Studio         Reading Wilde, Querying Spaces: Part   6       The Artist's Studio         The Artist's Studio is a place of seduction   and transformative power in Oscar Wilde's work. The Picture of Dorian Gray   opens in a studio: here Dorian is first seduced by Lord Henry Wotton's decadent   pronouncements and here the picture that leads Dorian to ruin is created. The   dual images of creation and decay represented by the studio draw Wilde's reader   into the very public battle waging over Aestheticism, the movement that adopted   Wilde as its most prominent emblem and most notorious sinner.     The Aesthetic Movement encompassed the   visual arts, the decorative arts, and literature. At Oxford, Wilde studied under   the two great art critics of the Victorian age, Walter Pater and John Ruskin.   Pater's injunction \"to know one's impression as it really is\" underlies Aestheticism's   guiding principle: the sole function of art is to inspire an emotion or create   a mood. Pater's influence on Wilde's art criticism is strong; \"All art is quite   useless,\" Wilde asserts in the Preface to Dorian Gray. The Aesthetic   Movement sought an art that exists for beauty alone. Arguments raged for and   against the amorality of art, with every major thinker and artist of the day   jumping into the fray. The highly publicized court battle between James McNeill   Whistler and John Ruskin over Whistler's aesthetic art set an early precedent   in the battle over the function of art in society. Later, for a time, Whistler   and Wilde were interchangeable figures to the public. They battled in the newspapers   and lecture halls for prominence, and Wilde won. He became the most visible   symbol of Aestheticism in the 1880s; he would become the scapegoat for its excesses,   both real and imagined, in the 1890s.     Wilde's own insistence on the amorality   of art was not uncomplicated, however, as shown in The Picture of Dorian   Gray. The studio represents both the perils and promises of the Aesthetic   Movement: artistic and sexual freedom from moral concerns--a space for homosexuality   and decadence. So long as these freedoms remained buried in the subtext or locked   in the studio, the outside world could enjoy the risque titillation of forbidden   life. But when the doors to the studio where flung open in the press and in   the courts, Wilde's life and art were shattered.   -- Lisa Golmitz      Walter   Pater, (1843-1894}   Studies in the History of the Renaissance. London: Macmillan, 1873.      W.   B. Yeats, in his Autobiography , quotes Wilde as saying of this book,   \"It is my golden book; I never travel anywhere without it; but it is the very   flower of decadence: the last trumpet should have sounded the moment it was   written.\" This is Walter Pater's famous book of essays, in which he attempts   to capture the spirit of the Renaissance through highly personal, impressionistic   sketches of artists and works of art. The Preface boldly gives direction to   Aestheticism, arguing against Matthew Arnold's injunction that one must \"see   the object as in itself it really is.\" Pater modifies this to knowing \"one's   impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly.\" The   aesthetic critic filters all art through the lens of himself, through the temperament   he cultivates. The Conclusion to the Renaissance became the touchstone   of the Art for Art s Sake Movement, with Pater's passionate injunction \"To burn   always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success   in life.\"          Photograph of Aubrey Beardsley             Serialized   from January through June, 1894, the exploits of Trilby, Svengali and the three   British expatriate artists in Paris were closely followed by an adoring public.   In this illustration by Du Maurier, a caricature of James McNeill Whistler as   Joe Sibley is easily identifiable in the right corner against the wall.

Here is the same illustration from    Trilby in the first hardcover edition of the novel. Du Maurier removed    the offensive references to Whistler from the text, and comically added    a rough beard to the caricature, seen here..                       Wilde v. Whistler: An Acrimonious Correspondence on Art. London:Privately   Printer, 1906.   This leaflet features many of the letters   published in the Pall Mall Gazette from both Wilde and Whistler in   which they argue over the provenance of Aesthetic theory. Whistler began in   his attacks in his series of lectures called \"Mr. Whistler's Ten o'Clock.\" Whistler   liked to believe that Wilde was his disciple, and so Wilde's increasing popularity   galled him. He attacked Wilde for his conceit, and for stealing his best ideas..   Wilde countered in the press and in his essay \"The Decay of Lying,\" which while   borrowing much of Whistler's tone, is a more coherent and interesting spin on   Aesthetic criticism than Whistler could admit.          Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics. London: Chatto and Windus,   1878.   In 1887, Whistler displayed several paintings   at the opening of Grosvenor Gallery. John Ruskin, the Slade Professor of Fine   Arts at Oxford and the leading art critic of his day, attacked Whistler's The   Nocturne in Black and Gold [The Falling Rocket] in a review of the show. Ruskin   wrote, \"I have seen and heard much of Cockney impudence before now, but never   expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint   in the public's face.\" Whistler was incensed, and sued Ruskin for libel. Although   Whistler argued that the issue of the case was not the merit of his art but   Ruskin's personal attack, the art itself was at the center of the trial. Whistler   won his case, but was awarded only a farthing in damages. Ruskin resigned his   professorship, arguing that a critic who cannot criticize is useless. Whistler   may have been morally vindicated bythe trial, but he was financially devastated.   This pamphlet was his failedattempt to recoup his losses. It was not well-received   by the art world, who sympathized with the fallen Ruskin..         Joris Karl Huysmans, (1848-1907)     Against the Grain. Paris: Groves & Michaux, 1926.    This   is a beautifully illustrated French edition of J.-K. Huysmans' infamous novel,   A Rebours . Huysmans hero, Duc Jean Floressas des Esseintes, is the   prototypical Decadent. Wilde, at his trial, admitted that des Esseintes was   one of the models for Dorian Gray, and that A Rebours is the book he   refers to in the novel that leads Dorian to a life of aesthetic and criminal   excess. Huysman's aesthete creates a completely artistic environment in which   to live, a studio where even artificial scents are introduced to create a mood.   This is an interior space where all manner of decadent behaviors can be indulged,   a space that, as the title implies, relies on nature for nothing. Des Esseintes   moves from one unsatisfying passion to another, never finding satiety for his   appetites.          Oscar   Wilde, (1854-1900)   Salom&eacute;: A Tragedy in One Act. Translated from the French of Oscar   Wilde: Pictured by Aubrey Beardsley. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane,   1894.   Mallarm&eacute; called it \"fine and sombre   like a chapter of the Apocalypse,\" but Wilde had a difficult time finding anyone   willing to stage this Decadent retelling of the Biblical tale. Written first   in French, Wilde threatened to adopt French citizenship if the British censors   refused to allow an English staging. It was refused by the Lord Chamberlain,   but Wilde went ahead with plans to publish the play in French. Elkin Mathews   & John Lane bought copies printed in France from Wilde for distribution in Britain.   Aubrey Beardsley was hired to illustrate the first English-language edition   of the play after Wilde saw an earlier drawing he had done of Salom&eacute;   for the Studio , and the results are these maniacal, sensuous drawings.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)  \"The Critic as Artist\" in Intentions . London: James R. Osgood, McIlvaine  and Company,1891.    This   dialogue between \"Ernest\" and \"Gilbert\" is a witty slap in the face to Whistler,   who felt that Wilde could not speak on the visual arts because he was not a   visual artist himself. This essay proposes that \"to know the principles of the   highest art is to know the principles of all the arts,\" and the highest art,   Wilde argues, is Criticism. \"It works with materials, and puts them into a form   that is at once new and delightful.What more can one say of poetry?\" Playing   with Arnold and Pater's rhetoric, Wilde asserts that the object of art is to   \"see the object as in itself it is not.\" Moreover, he states that \"Aesthetics   are higher than ethics. They belong to a more spiritual sphere. To discern the   beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive.\" In this essay,   Wilde praises Pater outright, obliquely criticizes Whistler, and takes on every   late Victorian argument about the purpose and function of art.          The Yellow Book. Volume I, April, 1894.   The Yellow Book was the brain-child   of Beardsley even down to its title. Novels by the French decadent writer were   often issued in yellow wrappers; the most important of the novels was J.K. Huysmans'   A Rebours , 1883. Beardsley proposed a new illustrated quarterly dedicated   to modern literature and art because \"many brilliant story painters and picture   writers cannot get their best stuff accepted in the conventional magazines,   either because they are not topical, or perhaps a little risqu.\" John Lane   agreed to publish the quarterly with Henry Harland as the literary editor and   Beardsley as the art editor. The Yellow Book published some of the   best authors and artists of the Nineties, often causing scandals to the conservative   public.   The first issue of The Yellow Book provoked outrage. The Times   referred to the \"repulsiveness and insolence\" of the cover; The Westminster   Gazette remarked about the \"Portrait of Mrs. Patrick Campbell\" it would   take \"a short act of Parliament to make this kind of thing illegal.\" Beardsley's   notoriety blossomed and the magazine sold briskly..

Following his socialist leanings and   his interest in medievalism, William Morris began the Kelmscott Press to bring   the joy of work back into the production of beautiful books. Based on close   study of the early printers, Morris developed typefaces and designed page layouts   that sparked the revival of printing. The influence of his designs can be seen   in all of Wilde's books, especially the first edition of The Picture of   Dorian Gray and The Sphinx.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)     The Sphinx. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane, 1894. Illustrated   by Charles Ricketts.   Perhaps the most beatiful book designed   in the 1890s, The Sphinx, is a tour de force of decadent style,   Wilde's elaborate poem inspired Charles Ricketts type design, use of three muted   colors of ink - cinnamon, forest, and black - and his exquisite woodcut illustrations.   Ricketts and his lover, Charles Shannon were members of Wilde's circle and Wilde   was a frequent visitor to their studio, The Vale. Basil Hallward's studio in   the opening scene of The Picture of Dorian Gray is modeled after their   studio.          George   Du Maurier, (1834-1896)   In Harper s New Monthly Magazine January-August,   1894.   George Du Maurier's Trilby became   a huge sensation when it was serialized in Harper's magazine in 1894.   Du Maurier had been an artstudent in Paris with Whistler, and while Whistler   became the leading artist of his day, Du Maurier became an illustrator for Punch .   Du Maurier's caricatures of Wilde and the Aesthetic Cult were enormously popular,   and Trilby also features Du Maurier's illustrations. Trilby is the   story of three young artists in Paris who discover a brassy artist's model and   proceed to fall in love with her. Trilby, though tone-deaf, is transformed through   mesmerism into a diva through the evil powers of the musician Svengali. Along   the way, Du Maurier illustrates the life in the studio of young, struggling   artists. Trilby became an overnight sensation, with the Trilby hat   the most memorable remnant of this fame. The Trilby Scrapbook in the Fales collection   represents a collector's excerpts from Harper's, Life, and other sources concerning   Trilby and Whistler's threatened lawsuit over Du Maurier's caricature of him   as the lazy Joe Sibley.          Prospectus for The Savoy   After being ejected from The Yellow   Book , Beardsley found financial support from two men, Andr&eacute; Raffalovich   and Leonard Smithers. Smithers became Beardsley's new publisher, starting The   Savoy with Arthur Symons as literary editor and Beardsley as art editor.   The magazine took its name from The Savoy hotel in which Wilde and Douglas entertained   the young men they met through Alfred Taylor. Beardsley developed his baroque   style in illustrations for The Savoy . Most important, his illustrations   for The Rape of the Lock and The Ballad of the Barber appeared   in subsequent issues. By 1896, shop-owners and newsstands refused to sell The   Savoy . It was a private act of censorship aimed at Beardsley. It worked.   The Savoy ceased publication after the December 1896 issue.

Our mission  is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global  citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for  student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly  communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced  Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished  faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we  think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the  intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They  challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and  beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual  responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world.      In spring 2005, the College of Arts and  Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends  the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to  upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and, if space  allows, seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the  College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and  from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental  leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars  are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes  toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count  only as electives.      Advanced Honors Seminars have three  central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between  exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students  intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking,  writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in  and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant  or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly  insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of  students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year!        G. Gabrielle Starr Acting Dean of the College        Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs          Course  Descriptions Winter 2012 The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Case  Study in Literary Research AHSEM-UA 126 Instructor: Marvin Taylor Monday through Friday, 12:30-3:20 p.m. Winter Session runs January 3-21, 2012      Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel, The  Picture of Dorian Gray , is a cultural lightning rod. When it was  first published in England, a firestorm of criticism hit the  newspapers and literary magazines, decrying the work as \u201cmorbid\u201d  and \u201cunhealthy\u201d\u2014coded language that suggested homosexuality to  the late-Victorian public. The novel has a complicated publication  history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the  U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde\u2019s novel  provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in  its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the  novel\u2019s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde\u2019s  correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text.  Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde\u2019s  London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere  Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement  philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, \u201cinversion,\u201d  late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian  ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do  in-depth research with the Fales Library\u2019s holdings exploring these  topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The  goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how  vital original sources are for the study of literary texts.   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 001.

Taylor has taught literary methodology, queer theory,  Victorian literature, and contemporary art history all from the  perspective of primary research in archives. His research about, and  interest in, Oscar Wilde led to his inclusion in the dramatis  personae of Moises Kaufman\u2019s play, Gross Indecency: The Three  Trials of Oscar Wilde.          Spring 2012            A History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will take up an extended  history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of  religion). It will begin with references to anthropology, the Hebrews  and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of  disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then will follow the uneven  progress of this idea and its consequences in Europe during the  Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the  Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the  19th century, when disbelief was allied with radical politics, before  moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism  and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence  of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course  will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the  most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief.  Readings may include selections from the Bible, as well as work by  Cicero, Hume, Mill, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Derrida, among  others.      Mitchell Stephens is Professor of  Journalism. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of  the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His  articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and  other subjects have appeared in the New York Times , Washington  Post , Los Angeles Times , and other publications. He is  currently writing books on the future of journalism and on the  history of disbelief.            \u201c Varieties of Religious  Experience\u201d Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will utilize but also  update William James\u2019s pioneering approach to interpreting and  understanding religion in psychological rather than theological  terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing  than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of  utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of  cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon  of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism,  apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort  modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the  vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral,  legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost  their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the  political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and  contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious  consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of  religious expression, understanding and experience that are  consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being  reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this  is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both  culture and personality will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was  Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      The century covered in this course saw  disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st  century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the  population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the  pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two  centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced  with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time  of wars and rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march  forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular  languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence  for all of Europe\u2026 and for our own culture. Through the darkest  periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of  the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and  Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who  transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who  informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many  historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible  of all the centuries before the 21st. Cross-listed with History as  HIST-UA 105.

The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.      Iconic images are pictures that become  rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future  reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an  iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and  takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar  explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers,  artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing  the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It  combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to  identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are  constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war  and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions  highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the  evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we  explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race,  and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display,  and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art,  music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In  addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to  archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a  photograph of their own choice.

Edmund Wilson and the Art of  Cultural Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Instructor: Paul Berman Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      Edmund Wilson (1895\u20131972) was the  greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a  good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe.  Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War  generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and  Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries.  But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political  and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic , the New  Yorker , the New York Review of Books and other magazines.  Reading a substantial sampling of Wilson\u2019s work, we will examine a  series of large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of  Greenwich Village early in the 20th century; the rise of literary  modernism; the influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War;  and various traditions of American thought and literature over the  centuries. We will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of  journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational  ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply  Wilson\u2019s principles of writing to their own compositions\u2014an  extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a  better writer.

Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in  20th-Century America AHSEM-UA 168 Instructor: Michael Nash Monday, 2:00-4:45 p.m.      Conflicts over racial equality, freedom  of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in  the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history.  These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans  fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business  interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state  governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar  examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place  as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during  periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore  these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of  political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary  course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and  read historical monographs that speak to this big and important  subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories  in the United States documenting the history of radical politics,  civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students  will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly  basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources,  interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research  questions. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664.

Political Cinema and Representation  of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is  viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be  eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternately,  reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus  primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most  conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also  explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United  States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will  explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically  and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in  filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history,  especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and  violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.

Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      The seventy-or-so years this seminar  examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world.  They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic  devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations  through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were  also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming  economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and  Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of  the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in  which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most  revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many  parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for  the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with  contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic  approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others  still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from  social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014 novels,  essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and  intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and  analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years,  including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia  Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James  Baldwin. The keynote to the seminar will come from Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s  \u201cWhat is Literature.\u201d Cross-listed with Comparative Literature  as COLIT-UA 181.

He earned an OBIE award for achievement in  Off-Broadway Theatre.            Mimesis and Mimicry AHSEM-UA 172 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This course will center on the concepts  of mimesis and its poor relation, mimicry. Mimesis refers to the way  in which aesthetic works refer: that is, it is about the  representation of reality in art. Mimicry is about closely imitating  the superficial characteristics of something or someone: it tends to  be less about art and more about life. Together, these concepts  provoke anxiety and interest about the ways in which reality and the  people and things in it can be reproduced, copied, faked, and  fictionalized. We will explore the related concepts of denotation,  appropriation, reference, plagiarism, and repetition. Texts may  include: Plato\u2019s Phaedrus ; Aristotle\u2019s Poetics ;  Michael Taussig\u2019s Mimesis and Alterity ; Derrida\u2019s   Dissemination ; Svetlana Alper\u2019s The Art of Describing ;  Roland Barthes, \u201cThe Reality Effect;\u201d Homi Bhabha, \u201cOf Mimicry  and Man;\u201d Luce Irigary, Speculum of the Other Woman ; Eric  Lott, Love and Theft ; Theodor Adorno, \u201cThe Radio Voice.\u201d   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 002.

She is currently working on a book about fictionality,  reference and metalepsis.            The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:15 p.m.      In contemporary media and in the wake  of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote  intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in  the pursuit of \u201ctruth\u201d. While some elements of this reputation  are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex  and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of  the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building,  in order to then turn to the Inquisition\u2019s internal organization  and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets  of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late fifteenth  through the late seventeenth centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism  (the conversos), Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and  Illuminati, witches, Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those  accused of sexual or religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and  sodomy). We close the semester considering what finally brought about  the definitive abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read  transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations,  historical chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an  Inquisitor\u2019s manual with instructions for torture, a witch hunting  treatise, and devotional literature. We also will examine more  contemporary reflections: Dostoevsky\u2019s 1880 The Brothers  Karamazov , Monty Python\u2019s 1970 \u201cNobody expects the Spanish  Inquisition\u201d skit, and the film adaptation of J.K.

Mapping AHSEM-UA 174 Instructor: Hilary Ballon Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      Maps are complex artifacts, both  pictorial and abstract, technical and symbolic, works of art and  science. This course will consider maps as ways of understanding,  picturing and abstracting the world, with examples from ancient Egypt  to Google Earth. Over time maps have become increasingly accurate,  built with precise measurements and rich with data, but they are also  ways of representing the world and conveying particular values and  ideas. With maps fast becoming a preferred scaffolding to organize  and access data\u2014witness, for example, the many applications of  Google Maps\u2014the rich history and complex nature of mapping has  particular relevance today. Topics to be covered in the seminar  include: Ptolemy\u2019s Geography ; world maps ( mappa mundi )  and cosmographical diagrams; mapping and geographic exploration; the  development of world atlases; the invention of true city plans;  warfare, state building and mapmaking; mapping as a tool of empire;  surveying and land ownership; Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  and spatial analysis; and experimental maps in contemporary art.

Ancient Egyptian Funerary Literature  and the Book of the Dead AHSEM-UA 175 Instructor: Rita Lucarelli Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.      This seminar gives an overview on the  religion of Pharaonic Egypt, on the basis of the numerous textual and  iconographical sources decorating tombs, coffins, papyri and other  funerary objects. In particular, the focus will be on the so-called  Book of the Dead, a collection of illustrated magical spells that  were in use in Egypt from about 1500 BCE until the Greco-Roman  period. The students will read a selection of spells (in translation)  from the Book of the Dead and analyze the illustrations related to  these texts, and will discuss aspects of the ancient Egyptian beliefs  in death and the netherworld. The ancient Egyptian pantheon of the  gods occurring in the sources will be presented and the complex  relationship among official religion, creation myths, personal piety  and everyday magical practices will be outlined and discussed in the  light of the most recent studies on the mortuary and magical  literature of ancient Egypt.      Rita Lucarelli is a Visiting Research  Scholar at NYU\u2019s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World  (ISAW). She studied at the University of Naples \u201cL\u2019Orientale,\u201d  Italy, where she took her MA degree in Classical Languages and  Egyptology. She holds her Ph.D. from Leiden University, The  Netherlands (2005) and her Ph.D. thesis was published in 2006 as The  Book of the Dead of Gatseshen: Ancient Egyptian Funerary Religion in  the 10th Century BC . Currently she works as Research Scholar at  the Book of the Dead Project of the University of Bonn, Germany. Her  primary research interests are the magical and funerary compositions  of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman Egypt, in particular those of the  so-called \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d papyri whose contents aimed at the  protection of the dead during his journey in the netherworld. She is  also currently preparing a monograph on demonology in ancient Egypt.  During her stay at the ISAW she will develop her research on  demonology on an interdisciplinary level, by comparing the beliefs in  demons in ancient Egypt with those in Mesopotamia during the 1st  Millennium BCE.            The NYU Mediation Lab: Sci-Fi  Edition AHSEM-UA 176 Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      MIT has its famous Media Lab \u201cto  envision the impact of emerging technologies.\u201d NYU now has its own  laboratory/workshop\u2014The Mediation Lab\u2014where we will scale up our  visions to include \u201cmedia\u201d of every kind. As our shorthand for  the work done by tools, \u201cmediation\u201d embraces all forms of  agency\u2014technological and human\u2014everything that intervenes,  enables, supplements, or acts in and on the world. This lab is thus  for students across the disciplines who want to participate in the  making of new knowledge\u2014knowledge that anticipates a future. Our  choice of project(s) for this edition of the Lab will be guided by  the genre best known for envisioning futures: science fiction. Our  selection of SF texts will be framed by turns to both the past\u2014Sir  Francis Bacon\u2019s arguments about new tools and new knowledge\u2014and  the present\u2014the physicist David Deutsch\u2019s new book The  Beginning of Infinity . The point of working together as a \u201clab\u201d  rather than a \u201cseminar\u201d is that we will do as well as think\u2014and  do so collaboratively rather than solely as individuals.

Irish History: Famine, Empire, and  Colonialism AHSEM-UA 177 Instructor: Joe Lee Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      The Great Famine of 1845-1851 was an  immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people and was the  catalyst for substantial changes\u2014positive and negative\u2014in Irish  society and culture; it also provoked a long history of debates about  the causes and solutions to global hunger that continue to resonate  today. This course explores the relationship between politics, power  and famine, with particular reference to the influence of political  cultures and institutions on decision making in the modern world,  through a number of case studies over the past two centuries. It  analyses the debates on the Amartya Sen thesis, that famines in the  modern world are due less to the failure of food-supply as such, and  more to the failure of non-democratic political systems. We will  explore a series of case\u2013studies of specific famines, including  Ireland (1845-52), Finland (1868), Bengal (1943-44, 1974-75) Russia  /USSR (1893, 1920-1, 1932-4), China (1964), and Ethiopia (1983-5).

Country and City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 178 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This Seminar focuses on the tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city in modern China through the prism of modern Chinese fiction and Chinese film. The story of modern China, in a sense, is the story of the transformation of a rural society into an urban, industrial one. This profound change in the socioeconomic sphere has produced equally profound changes in people\u2019s experience and consciousness, which in turn produce their cultural visions and artistic expressions. The story of modern China is also a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated \u201cindividual\u201d amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional\u2019s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. These issues, to be sure, are not unique or particular to China; rather, they speak to contemporary men and women worldwide. To study the particular historical experience and cultural formations of modern China may help us better grapple with many central concerns of contemporary life as well as our understanding of it. The compressed temporality in China\u2019s rapid metamorphosis from a sleepy rural giant to the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d not only means the mushrooming of Chinese cities, but also, and more importantly, an intense drama of social change, moral conflict, cultural diversity, and emotional strain. All of these have found their representation in literature and film: the rural-urban relationship offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity. Writers and works to be discussed include Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cHometown\u201d and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d; Lao She\u2019s \u201cCamel Xiangzi\u201d; Mao Dun\u2019s \u201cSpring Silkworm\u201d; Shen Congwen\u2019s \u201cVegetable Garden\u201d; Ailing Chang\u2019s \u201cSealed Off\u201d, among others.

Love, Prophecy and Madness in Arabic Literature and Islamic Culture, 7th-16th century AHSEM-UA 179 Instructor: Maurice Pomerantz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. In this course we will consider the important role that conceptions of love, prophecy and madness have played in religion, literature and culture in the Muslim world and its neighbors from the 7th-16th century. We will first consider earlier Ancient Near Eastern conceptions of the triad found in the Hebrew Bible, Ancient Greek thought (Plato, Aristotle, and later commentators). We will then address major works of Arabic literature and Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thought from the 7th-15th centuries, including the following topics/texts: Pre-Islamic Poetry; Qur'anic conceptions of prophecy/poetry/madness; Ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q's \"Life of the Prophet\"; the themes of lovesickness and madness in early Arabic Love Poetry (Ghazal); stories of early wise fools and sufi mystics; the Maq\u0101m\u0101t of al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b (11th century); the Arabian Nights; the Hebrew Poet Ibn Gabriol; the Persian Romance, Layli and Majnun_(madman); and Troubador Poetry. We will also read accounts of these themes in the works of the Muslim physicians, philosophers, and theologians (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b), and discuss the ways in which concepts of Love, Madness and Prophecy were received in the Medieval West and during the Renaissance and beyond.

{"detail": [{"content": "Part 6: The Artist's Studio         Reading Wilde, Querying Spaces: Part   6       The Artist's Studio         The Artist's Studio is a place of seduction   and transformative power in Oscar Wilde's work. The Picture of Dorian Gray   opens in a studio: here Dorian is first seduced by Lord Henry Wotton's decadent   pronouncements and here the picture that leads Dorian to ruin is created. The   dual images of creation and decay represented by the studio draw Wilde's reader   into the very public battle waging over Aestheticism, the movement that adopted   Wilde as its most prominent emblem and most notorious sinner.     The Aesthetic Movement encompassed the   visual arts, the decorative arts, and literature. At Oxford, Wilde studied under   the two great art critics of the Victorian age, Walter Pater and John Ruskin.   Pater's injunction \"to know one's impression as it really is\" underlies Aestheticism's   guiding principle: the sole function of art is to inspire an emotion or create   a mood. Pater's influence on Wilde's art criticism is strong; \"All art is quite   useless,\" Wilde asserts in the Preface to Dorian Gray. The Aesthetic   Movement sought an art that exists for beauty alone. Arguments raged for and   against the amorality of art, with every major thinker and artist of the day   jumping into the fray. The highly publicized court battle between James McNeill   Whistler and John Ruskin over Whistler's aesthetic art set an early precedent   in the battle over the function of art in society. Later, for a time, Whistler   and Wilde were interchangeable figures to the public. They battled in the newspapers   and lecture halls for prominence, and Wilde won. He became the most visible   symbol of Aestheticism in the 1880s; he would become the scapegoat for its excesses,   both real and imagined, in the 1890s.     Wilde's own insistence on the amorality   of art was not uncomplicated, however, as shown in The Picture of Dorian   Gray. The studio represents both the perils and promises of the Aesthetic   Movement: artistic and sexual freedom from moral concerns--a space for homosexuality   and decadence. So long as these freedoms remained buried in the subtext or locked   in the studio, the outside world could enjoy the risque titillation of forbidden   life. But when the doors to the studio where flung open in the press and in   the courts, Wilde's life and art were shattered.   -- Lisa Golmitz      Walter   Pater, (1843-1894}   Studies in the History of the Renaissance. London: Macmillan, 1873.      W.   B. Yeats, in his Autobiography , quotes Wilde as saying of this book,   \"It is my golden book; I never travel anywhere without it; but it is the very   flower of decadence: the last trumpet should have sounded the moment it was   written.\" This is Walter Pater's famous book of essays, in which he attempts   to capture the spirit of the Renaissance through highly personal, impressionistic   sketches of artists and works of art. The Preface boldly gives direction to   Aestheticism, arguing against Matthew Arnold's injunction that one must \"see   the object as in itself it really is.\" Pater modifies this to knowing \"one's   impression as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly.\" The   aesthetic critic filters all art through the lens of himself, through the temperament   he cultivates. The Conclusion to the Renaissance became the touchstone   of the Art for Art s Sake Movement, with Pater's passionate injunction \"To burn   always with this hard, gem-like flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success   in life.\"          Photograph of Aubrey Beardsley             Serialized   from January through June, 1894, the exploits of Trilby, Svengali and the three   British expatriate artists in Paris were closely followed by an adoring public.   In this illustration by Du Maurier, a caricature of James McNeill Whistler as   Joe Sibley is easily identifiable in the right corner against the wall. If the   text's description of Sibley was unmistakable to an irate Whistler, this illustration   was unmistakable to the public at large. Whistler threatened to sue if the character   was not removed..                    George Du Mau rier,    (1834-1896)      Trilby. New York: Harper's,    1894.     Here is the same illustration from    Trilby in the first hardcover edition of the novel. Du Maurier removed    the offensive references to Whistler from the text, and comically added    a rough beard to the caricature, seen here..                       Wilde v. Whistler: An Acrimonious Correspondence on Art. London:Privately   Printer, 1906.   This leaflet features many of the letters   published in the Pall Mall Gazette from both Wilde and Whistler in   which they argue over the provenance of Aesthetic theory. Whistler began in   his attacks in his series of lectures called \"Mr. Whistler's Ten o'Clock.\" Whistler   liked to believe that Wilde was his disciple, and so Wilde's increasing popularity   galled him. He attacked Wilde for his conceit, and for stealing his best ideas..   Wilde countered in the press and in his essay \"The Decay of Lying,\" which while   borrowing much of Whistler's tone, is a more coherent and interesting spin on   Aesthetic criticism than Whistler could admit.          Whistler v. Ruskin: Art and Art Critics. London: Chatto and Windus,   1878.   In 1887, Whistler displayed several paintings   at the opening of Grosvenor Gallery. John Ruskin, the Slade Professor of Fine   Arts at Oxford and the leading art critic of his day, attacked Whistler's The   Nocturne in Black and Gold [The Falling Rocket] in a review of the show. Ruskin   wrote, \"I have seen and heard much of Cockney impudence before now, but never   expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint   in the public's face.\" Whistler was incensed, and sued Ruskin for libel. Although   Whistler argued that the issue of the case was not the merit of his art but   Ruskin's personal attack, the art itself was at the center of the trial. Whistler   won his case, but was awarded only a farthing in damages. Ruskin resigned his   professorship, arguing that a critic who cannot criticize is useless. Whistler   may have been morally vindicated bythe trial, but he was financially devastated.   This pamphlet was his failedattempt to recoup his losses. It was not well-received   by the art world, who sympathized with the fallen Ruskin..         Joris Karl Huysmans, (1848-1907)     Against the Grain. Paris: Groves & Michaux, 1926.    This   is a beautifully illustrated French edition of J.-K. Huysmans' infamous novel,   A Rebours . Huysmans hero, Duc Jean Floressas des Esseintes, is the   prototypical Decadent. Wilde, at his trial, admitted that des Esseintes was   one of the models for Dorian Gray, and that A Rebours is the book he   refers to in the novel that leads Dorian to a life of aesthetic and criminal   excess. Huysman's aesthete creates a completely artistic environment in which   to live, a studio where even artificial scents are introduced to create a mood.   This is an interior space where all manner of decadent behaviors can be indulged,   a space that, as the title implies, relies on nature for nothing. Des Esseintes   moves from one unsatisfying passion to another, never finding satiety for his   appetites.          Oscar   Wilde, (1854-1900)   Salom&eacute;: A Tragedy in One Act. Translated from the French of Oscar   Wilde: Pictured by Aubrey Beardsley. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane,   1894.   Mallarm&eacute; called it \"fine and sombre   like a chapter of the Apocalypse,\" but Wilde had a difficult time finding anyone   willing to stage this Decadent retelling of the Biblical tale. Written first   in French, Wilde threatened to adopt French citizenship if the British censors   refused to allow an English staging. It was refused by the Lord Chamberlain,   but Wilde went ahead with plans to publish the play in French. Elkin Mathews   & John Lane bought copies printed in France from Wilde for distribution in Britain.   Aubrey Beardsley was hired to illustrate the first English-language edition   of the play after Wilde saw an earlier drawing he had done of Salom&eacute;   for the Studio , and the results are these maniacal, sensuous drawings.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)  \"The Critic as Artist\" in Intentions . London: James R. Osgood, McIlvaine  and Company,1891.    This   dialogue between \"Ernest\" and \"Gilbert\" is a witty slap in the face to Whistler,   who felt that Wilde could not speak on the visual arts because he was not a   visual artist himself. This essay proposes that \"to know the principles of the   highest art is to know the principles of all the arts,\" and the highest art,   Wilde argues, is Criticism. \"It works with materials, and puts them into a form   that is at once new and delightful.What more can one say of poetry?\" Playing   with Arnold and Pater's rhetoric, Wilde asserts that the object of art is to   \"see the object as in itself it is not.\" Moreover, he states that \"Aesthetics   are higher than ethics. They belong to a more spiritual sphere. To discern the   beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive.\" In this essay,   Wilde praises Pater outright, obliquely criticizes Whistler, and takes on every   late Victorian argument about the purpose and function of art.          The Yellow Book. Volume I, April, 1894.   The Yellow Book was the brain-child   of Beardsley even down to its title. Novels by the French decadent writer were   often issued in yellow wrappers; the most important of the novels was J.K. Huysmans'   A Rebours , 1883. Beardsley proposed a new illustrated quarterly dedicated   to modern literature and art because \"many brilliant story painters and picture   writers cannot get their best stuff accepted in the conventional magazines,   either because they are not topical, or perhaps a little risqu.\" John Lane   agreed to publish the quarterly with Henry Harland as the literary editor and   Beardsley as the art editor. The Yellow Book published some of the   best authors and artists of the Nineties, often causing scandals to the conservative   public.   The first issue of The Yellow Book provoked outrage. The Times   referred to the \"repulsiveness and insolence\" of the cover; The Westminster   Gazette remarked about the \"Portrait of Mrs. Patrick Campbell\" it would   take \"a short act of Parliament to make this kind of thing illegal.\" Beardsley's   notoriety blossomed and the magazine sold briskly..         Geoffrey Chaucer, (ca. 1343-1400)     The Works of Geoffry Chaucer Newly Imprinted. Hammersmith: TheKelmscott  Press, 1890.   Following his socialist leanings and   his interest in medievalism, William Morris began the Kelmscott Press to bring   the joy of work back into the production of beautiful books. Based on close   study of the early printers, Morris developed typefaces and designed page layouts   that sparked the revival of printing. The influence of his designs can be seen   in all of Wilde's books, especially the first edition of The Picture of   Dorian Gray and The Sphinx.            Oscar Wilde, (1854-1900)     The Sphinx. London: Elkin Mathews and John Lane, 1894. Illustrated   by Charles Ricketts.   Perhaps the most beatiful book designed   in the 1890s, The Sphinx, is a tour de force of decadent style,   Wilde's elaborate poem inspired Charles Ricketts type design, use of three muted   colors of ink - cinnamon, forest, and black - and his exquisite woodcut illustrations.   Ricketts and his lover, Charles Shannon were members of Wilde's circle and Wilde   was a frequent visitor to their studio, The Vale. Basil Hallward's studio in   the opening scene of The Picture of Dorian Gray is modeled after their   studio.          George   Du Maurier, (1834-1896)   In Harper s New Monthly Magazine January-August,   1894.   George Du Maurier's Trilby became   a huge sensation when it was serialized in Harper's magazine in 1894.   Du Maurier had been an artstudent in Paris with Whistler, and while Whistler   became the leading artist of his day, Du Maurier became an illustrator for Punch .   Du Maurier's caricatures of Wilde and the Aesthetic Cult were enormously popular,   and Trilby also features Du Maurier's illustrations. Trilby is the   story of three young artists in Paris who discover a brassy artist's model and   proceed to fall in love with her. Trilby, though tone-deaf, is transformed through   mesmerism into a diva through the evil powers of the musician Svengali. Along   the way, Du Maurier illustrates the life in the studio of young, struggling   artists. Trilby became an overnight sensation, with the Trilby hat   the most memorable remnant of this fame. The Trilby Scrapbook in the Fales collection   represents a collector's excerpts from Harper's, Life, and other sources concerning   Trilby and Whistler's threatened lawsuit over Du Maurier's caricature of him   as the lazy Joe Sibley.          Prospectus for The Savoy   After being ejected from The Yellow   Book , Beardsley found financial support from two men, Andr&eacute; Raffalovich   and Leonard Smithers. Smithers became Beardsley's new publisher, starting The   Savoy with Arthur Symons as literary editor and Beardsley as art editor.   The magazine took its name from The Savoy hotel in which Wilde and Douglas entertained   the young men they met through Alfred Taylor. Beardsley developed his baroque   style in illustrations for The Savoy . Most important, his illustrations   for The Rape of the Lock and The Ballad of the Barber appeared   in subsequent issues. By 1896, shop-owners and newsstands refused to sell The   Savoy . It was a private act of censorship aimed at Beardsley. It worked.   The Savoy ceased publication after the December 1896 issue. Shown is   the suppressed state of the prospectus, which was rejected because of the figure   appears to have an erection.

Our mission  is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global  citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for  student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly  communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced  Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished  faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we  think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the  intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They  challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and  beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual  responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world.      In spring 2005, the College of Arts and  Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends  the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to  upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and, if space  allows, seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the  College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and  from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental  leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars  are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes  toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count  only as electives.      Advanced Honors Seminars have three  central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between  exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students  intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking,  writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in  and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant  or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly  insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of  students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year!        G. Gabrielle Starr Acting Dean of the College        Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs          Course  Descriptions Winter 2012 The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Case  Study in Literary Research AHSEM-UA 126 Instructor: Marvin Taylor Monday through Friday, 12:30-3:20 p.m. Winter Session runs January 3-21, 2012      Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel, The  Picture of Dorian Gray , is a cultural lightning rod. When it was  first published in England, a firestorm of criticism hit the  newspapers and literary magazines, decrying the work as \u201cmorbid\u201d  and \u201cunhealthy\u201d\u2014coded language that suggested homosexuality to  the late-Victorian public. The novel has a complicated publication  history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the  U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde\u2019s novel  provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in  its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the  novel\u2019s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde\u2019s  correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text.  Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde\u2019s  London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere  Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement  philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, \u201cinversion,\u201d  late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian  ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do  in-depth research with the Fales Library\u2019s holdings exploring these  topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The  goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how  vital original sources are for the study of literary texts.   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 001.      Marvin Taylor is Director of the Fales  Library and Special Collections at NYU. He holds degrees from Indiana  University in Comparative Literature and Library Science, and in  English Literature from NYU. He has held positions at the Lilly  Library, Indiana University and the Rare Book and Manuscript Library,  and the Health Sciences Library at Columbia University before coming  to NYU. Taylor has taught literary methodology, queer theory,  Victorian literature, and contemporary art history all from the  perspective of primary research in archives. His research about, and  interest in, Oscar Wilde led to his inclusion in the dramatis  personae of Moises Kaufman\u2019s play, Gross Indecency: The Three  Trials of Oscar Wilde.          Spring 2012            A History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will take up an extended  history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of  religion). It will begin with references to anthropology, the Hebrews  and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of  disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then will follow the uneven  progress of this idea and its consequences in Europe during the  Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the  Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the  19th century, when disbelief was allied with radical politics, before  moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism  and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence  of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course  will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the  most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief.  Readings may include selections from the Bible, as well as work by  Cicero, Hume, Mill, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Derrida, among  others.      Mitchell Stephens is Professor of  Journalism. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of  the image the fall of the word and A History of News .

We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing  than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of  utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of  cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon  of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism,  apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort  modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the  vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral,  legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost  their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the  political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and  contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious  consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of  religious expression, understanding and experience that are  consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being  reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this  is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both  culture and personality will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was  Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      The century covered in this course saw  disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st  century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the  population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the  pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two  centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced  with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time  of wars and rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march  forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular  languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence  for all of Europe\u2026 and for our own culture. Through the darkest  periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of  the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and  Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who  transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who  informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many  historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible  of all the centuries before the 21st. Cross-listed with History as  HIST-UA 105.

The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.      Iconic images are pictures that become  rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future  reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an  iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and  takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar  explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers,  artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing  the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It  combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to  identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are  constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war  and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions  highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the  evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we  explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race,  and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display,  and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art,  music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In  addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to  archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a  photograph of their own choice.

Edmund Wilson and the Art of  Cultural Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Instructor: Paul Berman Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      Edmund Wilson (1895\u20131972) was the  greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a  good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe.  Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War  generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and  Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries.  But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political  and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic , the New  Yorker , the New York Review of Books and other magazines.  Reading a substantial sampling of Wilson\u2019s work, we will examine a  series of large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of  Greenwich Village early in the 20th century; the rise of literary  modernism; the influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War;  and various traditions of American thought and literature over the  centuries. We will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of  journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational  ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply  Wilson\u2019s principles of writing to their own compositions\u2014an  extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a  better writer.

Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in  20th-Century America AHSEM-UA 168 Instructor: Michael Nash Monday, 2:00-4:45 p.m.      Conflicts over racial equality, freedom  of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in  the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history.  These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans  fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business  interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state  governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar  examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place  as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during  periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore  these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of  political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary  course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and  read historical monographs that speak to this big and important  subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories  in the United States documenting the history of radical politics,  civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students  will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly  basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources,  interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research  questions. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664.

Political Cinema and Representation  of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is  viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be  eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternately,  reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus  primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most  conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also  explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United  States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will  explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically  and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in  filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history,  especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and  violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.

Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      The seventy-or-so years this seminar  examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world.  They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic  devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations  through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were  also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming  economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and  Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of  the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in  which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most  revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many  parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for  the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with  contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic  approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others  still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from  social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014 novels,  essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and  intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and  analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years,  including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia  Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James  Baldwin.

Mimesis and Mimicry AHSEM-UA 172 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This course will center on the concepts  of mimesis and its poor relation, mimicry. Mimesis refers to the way  in which aesthetic works refer: that is, it is about the  representation of reality in art. Mimicry is about closely imitating  the superficial characteristics of something or someone: it tends to  be less about art and more about life. Together, these concepts  provoke anxiety and interest about the ways in which reality and the  people and things in it can be reproduced, copied, faked, and  fictionalized. We will explore the related concepts of denotation,  appropriation, reference, plagiarism, and repetition. Texts may  include: Plato\u2019s Phaedrus ; Aristotle\u2019s Poetics ;  Michael Taussig\u2019s Mimesis and Alterity ; Derrida\u2019s   Dissemination ; Svetlana Alper\u2019s The Art of Describing ;  Roland Barthes, \u201cThe Reality Effect;\u201d Homi Bhabha, \u201cOf Mimicry  and Man;\u201d Luce Irigary, Speculum of the Other Woman ; Eric  Lott, Love and Theft ; Theodor Adorno, \u201cThe Radio Voice.\u201d   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 002.

She is currently working on a book about fictionality,  reference and metalepsis.            The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:15 p.m.      In contemporary media and in the wake  of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote  intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in  the pursuit of \u201ctruth\u201d. While some elements of this reputation  are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex  and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of  the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building,  in order to then turn to the Inquisition\u2019s internal organization  and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets  of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late fifteenth  through the late seventeenth centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism  (the conversos), Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and  Illuminati, witches, Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those  accused of sexual or religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and  sodomy). We close the semester considering what finally brought about  the definitive abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read  transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations,  historical chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an  Inquisitor\u2019s manual with instructions for torture, a witch hunting  treatise, and devotional literature. We also will examine more  contemporary reflections: Dostoevsky\u2019s 1880 The Brothers  Karamazov , Monty Python\u2019s 1970 \u201cNobody expects the Spanish  Inquisition\u201d skit, and the film adaptation of J.K.

Mapping AHSEM-UA 174 Instructor: Hilary Ballon Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      Maps are complex artifacts, both  pictorial and abstract, technical and symbolic, works of art and  science. This course will consider maps as ways of understanding,  picturing and abstracting the world, with examples from ancient Egypt  to Google Earth. Over time maps have become increasingly accurate,  built with precise measurements and rich with data, but they are also  ways of representing the world and conveying particular values and  ideas. With maps fast becoming a preferred scaffolding to organize  and access data\u2014witness, for example, the many applications of  Google Maps\u2014the rich history and complex nature of mapping has  particular relevance today. Topics to be covered in the seminar  include: Ptolemy\u2019s Geography ; world maps ( mappa mundi )  and cosmographical diagrams; mapping and geographic exploration; the  development of world atlases; the invention of true city plans;  warfare, state building and mapmaking; mapping as a tool of empire;  surveying and land ownership; Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  and spatial analysis; and experimental maps in contemporary art.

Ancient Egyptian Funerary Literature  and the Book of the Dead AHSEM-UA 175 Instructor: Rita Lucarelli Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.      This seminar gives an overview on the  religion of Pharaonic Egypt, on the basis of the numerous textual and  iconographical sources decorating tombs, coffins, papyri and other  funerary objects. In particular, the focus will be on the so-called  Book of the Dead, a collection of illustrated magical spells that  were in use in Egypt from about 1500 BCE until the Greco-Roman  period. The students will read a selection of spells (in translation)  from the Book of the Dead and analyze the illustrations related to  these texts, and will discuss aspects of the ancient Egyptian beliefs  in death and the netherworld. The ancient Egyptian pantheon of the  gods occurring in the sources will be presented and the complex  relationship among official religion, creation myths, personal piety  and everyday magical practices will be outlined and discussed in the  light of the most recent studies on the mortuary and magical  literature of ancient Egypt.      Rita Lucarelli is a Visiting Research  Scholar at NYU\u2019s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World  (ISAW). She studied at the University of Naples \u201cL\u2019Orientale,\u201d  Italy, where she took her MA degree in Classical Languages and  Egyptology. She holds her Ph.D. from Leiden University, The  Netherlands (2005) and her Ph.D. thesis was published in 2006 as The  Book of the Dead of Gatseshen: Ancient Egyptian Funerary Religion in  the 10th Century BC . Currently she works as Research Scholar at  the Book of the Dead Project of the University of Bonn, Germany. Her  primary research interests are the magical and funerary compositions  of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman Egypt, in particular those of the  so-called \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d papyri whose contents aimed at the  protection of the dead during his journey in the netherworld. She is  also currently preparing a monograph on demonology in ancient Egypt.  During her stay at the ISAW she will develop her research on  demonology on an interdisciplinary level, by comparing the beliefs in  demons in ancient Egypt with those in Mesopotamia during the 1st  Millennium BCE.            The NYU Mediation Lab: Sci-Fi  Edition AHSEM-UA 176 Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      MIT has its famous Media Lab \u201cto  envision the impact of emerging technologies.\u201d NYU now has its own  laboratory/workshop\u2014The Mediation Lab\u2014where we will scale up our  visions to include \u201cmedia\u201d of every kind. As our shorthand for  the work done by tools, \u201cmediation\u201d embraces all forms of  agency\u2014technological and human\u2014everything that intervenes,  enables, supplements, or acts in and on the world. This lab is thus  for students across the disciplines who want to participate in the  making of new knowledge\u2014knowledge that anticipates a future. Our  choice of project(s) for this edition of the Lab will be guided by  the genre best known for envisioning futures: science fiction. Our  selection of SF texts will be framed by turns to both the past\u2014Sir  Francis Bacon\u2019s arguments about new tools and new knowledge\u2014and  the present\u2014the physicist David Deutsch\u2019s new book The  Beginning of Infinity . The point of working together as a \u201clab\u201d  rather than a \u201cseminar\u201d is that we will do as well as think\u2014and  do so collaboratively rather than solely as individuals.

Irish History: Famine, Empire, and  Colonialism AHSEM-UA 177 Instructor: Joe Lee Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      The Great Famine of 1845-1851 was an  immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people and was the  catalyst for substantial changes\u2014positive and negative\u2014in Irish  society and culture; it also provoked a long history of debates about  the causes and solutions to global hunger that continue to resonate  today. This course explores the relationship between politics, power  and famine, with particular reference to the influence of political  cultures and institutions on decision making in the modern world,  through a number of case studies over the past two centuries. It  analyses the debates on the Amartya Sen thesis, that famines in the  modern world are due less to the failure of food-supply as such, and  more to the failure of non-democratic political systems. We will  explore a series of case\u2013studies of specific famines, including  Ireland (1845-52), Finland (1868), Bengal (1943-44, 1974-75) Russia  /USSR (1893, 1920-1, 1932-4), China (1964), and Ethiopia (1983-5).

Country and City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 178 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This Seminar focuses on the tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city in modern China through the prism of modern Chinese fiction and Chinese film. The story of modern China, in a sense, is the story of the transformation of a rural society into an urban, industrial one. This profound change in the socioeconomic sphere has produced equally profound changes in people\u2019s experience and consciousness, which in turn produce their cultural visions and artistic expressions. The story of modern China is also a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated \u201cindividual\u201d amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional\u2019s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. These issues, to be sure, are not unique or particular to China; rather, they speak to contemporary men and women worldwide. To study the particular historical experience and cultural formations of modern China may help us better grapple with many central concerns of contemporary life as well as our understanding of it. The compressed temporality in China\u2019s rapid metamorphosis from a sleepy rural giant to the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d not only means the mushrooming of Chinese cities, but also, and more importantly, an intense drama of social change, moral conflict, cultural diversity, and emotional strain. All of these have found their representation in literature and film: the rural-urban relationship offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity. Writers and works to be discussed include Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cHometown\u201d and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d; Lao She\u2019s \u201cCamel Xiangzi\u201d; Mao Dun\u2019s \u201cSpring Silkworm\u201d; Shen Congwen\u2019s \u201cVegetable Garden\u201d; Ailing Chang\u2019s \u201cSealed Off\u201d, among others. Films to be screened and discussed include \u201cCrows and Sparrows\u201d and \u201cThe World.\u201d Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts &amp; Science and the Department of East Asian Studies.

Love, Prophecy and Madness in Arabic Literature and Islamic Culture, 7th-16th century AHSEM-UA 179 Instructor: Maurice Pomerantz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. In this course we will consider the important role that conceptions of love, prophecy and madness have played in religion, literature and culture in the Muslim world and its neighbors from the 7th-16th century. We will first consider earlier Ancient Near Eastern conceptions of the triad found in the Hebrew Bible, Ancient Greek thought (Plato, Aristotle, and later commentators). We will then address major works of Arabic literature and Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thought from the 7th-15th centuries, including the following topics/texts: Pre-Islamic Poetry; Qur'anic conceptions of prophecy/poetry/madness; Ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q's \"Life of the Prophet\"; the themes of lovesickness and madness in early Arabic Love Poetry (Ghazal); stories of early wise fools and sufi mystics; the Maq\u0101m\u0101t of al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b (11th century); the Arabian Nights; the Hebrew Poet Ibn Gabriol; the Persian Romance, Layli and Majnun_(madman); and Troubador Poetry. We will also read accounts of these themes in the works of the Muslim physicians, philosophers, and theologians (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b), and discuss the ways in which concepts of Love, Madness and Prophecy were received in the Medieval West and during the Renaissance and beyond.

Our mission is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and, if space allows, seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  Fall 2013  The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Instructor: Deborah Willis  Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.  Iconic   images are pictures that become rooted in our personal memory and are   stored away for future reference through our experiences with them.   Often, the power of an iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its   original purpose and takes on another form socially and historically.   This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by   photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in   addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and   film. It combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches   to identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are   constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war   and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions highlight   the trends and transformations that have characterized the evolution of   the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we explore the   construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race, and pop   culture. We also consider issues of representation, display, and   reception, as well as the wider social context in which art, music, and   culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In addition to   classes held on campus, field trips are taken to archives, museums and   galleries. Each week students discuss a photograph of their own choice.

The NYU Mediation Lab: Course-of-the-Future/Make Your MOOC Edition AHSEM-UA 176 Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.  MIT   has its famous Media Lab (media.mit.edu) for \u201cenvisioning the impact of   emerging technologies.\u201d Here at NYU we use the more inclusive term,   \u201cmediation,\u201d to invite students from every discipline of FAS to   participate in the making of new knowledge. For this fourth edition of   the Lab, we\u2019ll take our cue from what the NYT insists is \u201cthe   educational happening of the moment\u201d: Massive Open Online Courses. MOOCs   exploded after 150,000 students signed up for an Artificial   Intelligence course offered by a Stanford professor. He\u2019s now left the   university to start one of many new companies competing to sign up   universities anxious to not miss the boat. Yes, it\u2019s new to them, but   what about you? Just as in your flesh and blood classrooms, these   virtual courses are primarily being designed and taught by faculty. If   this form is the future of education\u2014if it\u2019s really going to be NEW and   not (in the worst case) just the same faculty you already have acting   out in front of the camera\u2014shouldn\u2019t students be in on the act? Bring   your experiences, knowledge, and ambitions from your disciplinary homes   to the Lab where, together, we will research, write, design, invent\u2014and   possibly produce\u2014the course of the future. Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 800, section 001.  Clifford Siskin is   the Henry W. and Alfred A. Berg Professor of English and American   Literature and the Director of The Re:Enlightenment Project. His subject   is the interrelations of literary, social, and technological change.   Links between past and present inform all of his work, from his   sequencing of the genres of subjectivity ( The Historicity of Romantic Discourse ) to his recovery of literature\u2019s role in the formation of the modern disciplines (The Work of Writing ). He is also co-editor, with William Warner, of This Is Enlightenment ,   and a forthcoming monograph that asks when and how the central genre of   Enlightenment became the thing that we now love to blame: the SYSTEM.  Art Meets Brain AHSEM-UA 190 Instructor: Wendy Suzuki Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.  What   makes us creative? What is the brain basis of our creativity? This   class will explore the intersection of creative art in a wide range of   formats on the one hand and neuroscience on the other. Guests artists   will include: Julie Burstein, best-selling author, journalist and expert   on creativity; Craig D\u2019Amico, actor and acting coach; Baba Brinkman,   science rapper; Patrick Terry, magician; Matthew Wilson, professional   clown; Erika Shannon, dancer and dance instructor; and Jody Oberfelder,   choreographer. Students will first explore each of these different art   forms through direct participation (i.e., all students should be ready   to dance, act, rap etc.). We will then discuss the latest neuroscience   and cognitive psychology underlying the each of these unique creative   arts. Small teams of students will then research and present questions   and discussion topics related to the topic. Strong collaboration,   participation, and interaction as well as little sweat are all   requirements for class sessions.  Wendy Suzuki    is a Professor of Neural Science and Psychology in the Center for   Neural Science at NYU. She runs a research lab that examines the parts   of the brain important for long-term memory and the effects of exercise   on learning, memory and cognition in humans. She is also a group fitness   instructor, and teaches a course called \u201cCan Exercise Change your   Brain?\u201d that combines physical workouts in class with lecture and   discussion on the neuroscience behind how exercise can change your   brain. In addition, she co-directs a program at NYU called Empowering   New Scientists. Making Art in the Anthropocene: A Creative Research Project on Ecology, Species, and Vibrant Matter AHSEM-UA 193 Instructor: Una Chaudhuri and Fritz Ertl Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. \u201cEither   stop writing, or write like a rat!\u201d In one of the most provocative   texts in contemporary animal philosophy, the French philosophers Gilles   Deleuze and Felix Guattari famously propose \u201cbecoming animal\u201d as a   liberating artistic practice. This workshop-cum-seminar will engage   with key themes in recent \u201cpost-humanist\u201d discourse by applying and   testing them in our own creative practice. We will read recent theories   of species, ecology, and matter (by writers like Jacques Derrida, Donna   Haraway, Elizabeth Grosz, Jane Bennett, and Timothy Morton) and we will   study a variety of literary, cinematic and visual art works that seem to   resonate with key themes of that discourse (works like Wallace Shawn\u2019s Grasses of a Thousand Colors , Cesar Aira\u2019s An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter , Marina Zurkow\u2019s \u201cSlurb,\u201d Marian Engel\u2019s Bear , and Robinson Devor\u2019s Zoo ).   Our seminar-style investigations of these texts and artworks will   regularly be applied in workshop sessions where we will use space,   objects, movement, sound, imagery, and writing to explore the aesthetic   implications of these theoretical ideas. A main interest of this course   is to experiment with \u201ccreative research,\u201d a way of doing intellectual   work in which art-making is regarded as\u2014and systematically used as\u2014a   mode of knowledge and inquiry, and in which ideas are developed by doing and making    as well as by thinking/writing/speaking. Prior artistic   training/practice is welcomed but not required; however, all students   must be willing to and interested in exploring their \"inner artist.\"   Cross-listed with Animal Studies as ANST-UA 393, section 001; with   English as ENGL-UA 800, section 002; with Environmental Studies as   ENVST-UA 593, section 001; with Dramatic Literature as DRLIT-UA 971,   section 002; and with the Department of Drama in the Tisch School of the Arts as THEA-UT 801, section 004.

Realism and How To Get Rid of It AHSEM-UA 195 Instructor: Thomas Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Realism (with a capital r) was a nineteenth-century school in literature, theater, and art that sought to portray reality as objectively as possible. The twentieth century saw various reactions against Realism, such as the stream-of-consciousness novel, surrealism, Brechtian epic theater, theater of the absurd, the first-person singular narrative, postmodernism, and abstract expressionism. Though they were very different from each other, all had more subjective, idiosyncratic ways of understanding and representing reality. We start with icons of Realism (e.g., Balzac, James, Ibsen) and continue through twentieth-century masterpieces of anti-realism, from novels by Camus, Robbe-Grillet and Paul Auster, to plays by Pirandello, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett and Pinter, concentrating on form, language, and conventions, and the relationship of the work to the reader or spectator. In addition to literature, we contrast \u201ctraditional\u201d narrative cinema with nonlinear cinema, and Realism in painting with contemporary non-realistic art. Throughout, we examine critical texts related aesthetics of Realism and anti-realism. Cross-listed with Comparative Literature as COLIT-UA 181, section 001. Tom Bishop is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature, and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU.

He has received numerous decorations from the French government as well as the Grand Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. He earned an OBIE award for achievement in Off-Broadway Theatre.  Staging the Self: Biography, Autobiography &amp; Performance AHSEM-UA 196 Instructor: Carol Martin Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m. In this course we examine the representation of personal experience in its biographical and autobiographical forms in the arts, with a focus on performance. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which personhood is aesthetically, psychologically, and politically theorized in different contexts. What does an individual\u2019s experience represent in specific works of art? How is the relationship of individual experience to collective experience reconstructed in different works? Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist\u2019s oeuvre in relation to his or her personal life? In what ways do individual works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities? Are Irving Goffman\u2019s ideas about the performance of self in everyday life relevant to the personal identities represented in museums, in documentary film, in architecture, and on theatrical stages? Can the individual lives represented in art accurately represent abstract social relations? Texts for the course include works by Irving Goffman, Errol Morris, Erik Erikson, Joseph Roach, Freddie Rokem, Deirdre Heddon, and selected plays, films and museum displays. Carol Martin is Professor of Drama at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. She writes on documentary theatre, contemporary American and Japanese performance, as well as on performance and globalization. Her essays and interviews have appeared in academic journals in the U.S. and abroad and in the New York Times and have been translated into French, Polish, Chinese, and Japanese. Her most recent book is Dramaturgy of the Real on the World Stage .    Seeing the City AHSEM-UA 198 Instructor: Richard Sennett Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This seminar explores how the buildings, streets, and public spaces of a city relate to its economic, social, and political life. The seminar thus bridges visual studies and the social sciences. The seminar is pro-active. In addition to classroom readings and discussions, you will work in small teams to photograph and film particular conditions in the city. Your term project will take you into one of the Marron Institute's urban design projects. The course aims to sensitize you to the urban environment, as well as introduce you to the skills urbanists use in their work. Richard Sennett is a Professor of Sociology at NYU and at the London School of Economics, where he is also chair of The Cities Programme. He has executed design projects for New York City, Berlin, Beirut, and other cities and also headed UNESCO's Committee on Cities and World Heritage. Professor Sennett's work explores how individuals and groups make social and cultural sense of material facts (their urban environments, what they do for a living, etc.). His research entails ethnography, history, and social theory, continuing the pragmatist tradition pioneered by William James and John Dewey. His first books, The Uses of Disorder and The Hidden Injuries of Class , examined the formation of personal and working-class identity in the modern city and society. Since the 1990s he has charted the personal consequences for workers of the work-world of modern capitalism in such studies as The Corrosion of Character , Respect in a World of Inequality , and The Culture of the New Capitalism . Professor Sennett Richard is assisted in the seminar by Dom Bagnato, a film maker and researcher at the Marron Institute.   Winter 2013   The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Case Study in Literary Research AHSEM-UA 126 Instructor: Marvin Taylor Monday through Friday, 10:30 a.m.\u20131:00 p.m. Winter Session runs January 7-25, 2013  Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray , is a cultural lightning rod. When it was first published in England, a firestorm of criticism hit the newspapers and literary magazines, decrying the work as \u201cmorbid\u201d and \u201cunhealthy\u201d\u2014coded language that suggested homosexuality to the late-Victorian public. The novel has a complicated publication history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde\u2019s novel provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the novel\u2019s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde\u2019s correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text. Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde\u2019s London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, \u201cinversion,\u201d late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do in-depth research with the Fales Library\u2019s holdings exploring these topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how vital original sources are for the study of literary texts. Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252.001 .  Marvin Taylor is Director of the Fales Library and Special Collections at NYU. He holds degrees from Indiana University in Comparative Literature and Library Science, and in English Literature from NYU. He has held positions at the Lilly Library, Indiana University and the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, and the Health Sciences Library at Columbia University before coming to NYU. Taylor has taught literary methodology, queer theory, Victorian literature, and contemporary art history all from the perspective of primary research in archives. His research about, and interest in, Oscar Wilde led to his inclusion in the dramatis personae of Moises Kaufman\u2019s play, Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde .  Spring 2013  A History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.  This seminar will take up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It will begin with references to anthropology, the Hebrews and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then will follow the uneven progress of this idea and its consequences in Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was allied with radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Readings may include selections from the Bible, as well as work by Cicero, Hume, Mill, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Derrida, among others.  Mitchell Stephens is Professor of Journalism. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times , and other publications. He is currently writing books on the future of journalism and on the history of disbelief.  Abortion: Examining the Issues AHSEM-UA 142 Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.  This multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal, medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both\u2014indeed, sometimes several\u2014sides of the issues involved. We will also look at the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue. This course counts towards the major in Gender and Sexuality Studies.  Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz , is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She has published widely on many aspects of medieval literature and culture. She has also been researching and writing about abortion for several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about abortion in New York and Washington, D.C. \u201cVarieties of Religious Experience\u201d Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Instructor: James Gilligan Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This seminar will utilize but also update William James\u2019s pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur. Cross-listed with Religious Studies as RELST-UA 140.001. Please note that this course does not satisfy the advanced seminar requirement for Religious Studies majors.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.  The century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time of wars and rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe\u2026 and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 21st. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 105.001.

Metapatterns from Quarks to Culture AHSEM-UA 154 Instructor: Tyler Volk Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.  This class will allow you to develop projects along areas of interest that could aid your career as well as expand your mind. The instructor will introduce the concept of metapatterns: structural/functional patterns in systems, which occur across the levels of the universe, as it built in a series of steps of \u201ccombigenesis\u201d from quarks to culture (about 12 main-path steps, including the emergence of atoms, simplest cells, animal societies, agriculture, the state). Examining these steps, we will explore themes such as binaries, borders, centers, and alphabetic holarchies. You will apply these and more (such as complexity theory, networks, positive and negative feedbacks) to topics that interest you, from the environment to, say, music, language, biological or cultural evolution, levels in politics, or just the overall nature of reality (your imagination is the only limit). For a flavor of the material, see the instructor\u2019s book \u201cMetapatterns Across Space, Time, and Mind,\u201d or the instructor\u2019s papers about metapatterns available from this website (http://metapatterns.wikidot.com/members:tylervolk), or the instructor\u2019s 3 (so far, maybe you will make the next in this course) youtube videos on metapatterns (search \u201cprofessortylevolk\u201d and \u201cmetapatterns\u201d).

Power, Domination, and Resistance  AHSEM-UA 166 Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.  This course will introduce students to the complexities of conceptualizing and studying power. How do we determine where it lies? Who has more and who less? How do we study its mechanisms and effects, above all in view of the intuition that it is at its most effective when least observable by both agents and observers? Is power at its most effective when most imperceptible, and, if so, how are we to study it? What are the relations between the concept of \u201cpower\u201d and such related concepts as \u201cauthority,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d? What is the relationship between so-called \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d power? We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 938.001.

Political Cinema and Representation of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Monday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.  In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternatively, reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.  Shimon Dotan , a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit.

Diplomacy in the 21st Century: Contemporary Challenges to an Ancient Profession AHSEM-UA 180 Instructor: Ambassador Fran\u00e7ois Barras Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.  Diplomacy, one of the prime methods by which mankind manages relations between politically organized groups, has undergone a profound transformation in recent decades due (among other factors) to the information revolution, globalization, and the increased relevance of new non-state actors in international affairs. How do diplomats and governments react to these changes? Does traditional diplomacy still matter in today\u2019s world? What skills are required to be a competent diplomat in the 21st century? This seminar aims to answer these questions by exploring the many dimensions of contemporary diplomacy. We will begin with an historical perspective and then explore the different types of diplomatic activities, such as political, commercial, cultural, and scientific; bilateral and multilateral; soft and hard; secret, discreet, and public. We will also focus on current challenges facing diplomacy. Topics will be addressed through selected readings, discussions with the instructor, guest speakers, and visits to diplomatic missions in New York.  Ambassador Fran\u00e7ois Barras is Consul General of Switzerland in New York. He was appointed to this post in 2010, having previously served as Ambassador of Switzerland to Lebanon (2006\u20132010), Swiss General Consul to Hong Kong and Macao (2003\u20132006), and Ambassador of Switzerland to the United Arab Emirates (1999\u20132003).

History of Medicine and Dentistry AHSEM-UA 181 Instructor: Andrew I. Spielman Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.  Adqui consilium futuri ex praeterito venit . \u201cWe gain advice for the future from the past,\u201d said Seneca in 69 A.D. Understanding the history of major medical and dental discoveries leads to a better appreciation of what we have today. This seminar deals with important topics in the history of medicine and dentistry, with an emphasis on the last 500 years. Topics include: the origins of \u201can eye for an eye\u201d and \u201ca tooth for a tooth\u201d; the real DaVinci Code; three weasels, a coat-of-arms, and the rise of anatomy; how the dark secret of the Sun King changed surgeons forever; how laughing gas is no laughing matter in medicine; and the stories of Jenner, Pasteur and Koch, and other giants in the field of medicine. Additionally, the course explores the history of the modern dental and medical professions. Assignments include a short, in-class context presentation, active class participation and a final class video project that links the major medical discoveries across centuries and their dependence on each other.

During the past decade his research and educational interests have also included the history of dentistry and medicine. He is currently working on the history of the NYU College of Dentistry.  The Consolation of Philosophy: Boethius and Boethian Literature in the Middle Ages AHSEM-UA 182 Instructor: Haruko Momma Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013 12:00 p.m.  Why do bad things happen to good people? Why is Fortune so cruel? Is our fate predetermined? If so, is there any point in exercising our free will? How can we ever be happy? Can philosophy help us get through difficult times? These are questions raised in The Consolation of Philosophy , a dialogue written by the Roman philosopher Boethius (c.480-524/6), while staying in prison and waiting for King Theodoric\u2019s order for his execution. Boethius\u2019s Consolation touched the hearts of many readers in the Middle Ages (and beyond) and influenced the work of numerous writers and philosophers from this period. In the Divine Comedy , for example, Dante places Boethius in the Fifth Heaven. His Consolation was translated by, among others, King Alfred (848/9\u2013899), Chaucer (c.1340\u20131400), and Queen Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603). In our course, we will consider many of questions raised by Boethius by reading The Consolation of Philosophy and (mostly) medieval adaptations of and responses to Boethius and Boethian themes, including Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde , the Death of King Arthur ; and The Seafarer and other Old English elegies. We will also consult philosophical works that influenced Boethius: e.g. Plato, Aristotle, and St. Augustine. Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252.001 and with Medieval and Renaissance Studies as MEDI-UA 182.001. This course will count as a \"pre-1800 course\" towards the English major.

Her current project concerns the power of prayer and its role in early societies.  Civil Rights and Civil Wrongs: The Fight for Equality in the United States AHSEM-UA 183 Instructor: K. Kevyne Baar Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.  Shortly after graduating from Oberlin College in 1847, abolitionist and women\u2019s rights advocate Lucy Stone remarked, \u201cI expect to plead not for the slave only, but for suffering humanity everywhere. Especially do I mean to labor for the elevation of my sex.\u201d Three years later, 1850 found her on a national stage at a conference on women\u2019s rights that included noted abolitionists. Stone understood the necessity of a fight that brings rights to all peoples. There were those who felt she and some of the other women present were dupes of the abolitionists. History would unfortunately prove this correct, for when African-American men were given the vote through the 15th Amendment, the abolitionists felt their work was done. It would take another 50 years before women would be granted the right to vote. Recognizing, as Lucy Stone did, that the fight for human rights does not exist in a vacuum, this course will look at the intersection of the three major American movements for African-American rights, women\u2019s rights, and gay rights. Looking back over 160 years of history, we will compare and contrast the three movements. We will also examine how events in the United States and around the world informed and changed the dialogue on civil rights as so many fight even today to keep the conversation alive.

In this course, we will be reading about and discussing various forms of mobility and exchange\u2014including trade and travel, conquest and religious conversion, different diaspora communities and migrations\u2014across a large area that extends from East Africa to the islands of Southeast Asia, from Yemen and Arabia to the Indian subcontinent. Our temporal focus will be the Middle Ages; we conclude with the beginnings of the Age of Discovery (16th century) and discuss how significant changes in technology, politics, and conquest challenged older patterns of mercantile mobility and cultural exchange. The purpose of this seminar will be to understand this complex and integrated commercial and cultural system, by considering the movements of goods and peoples across the Indian Ocean world.

Enlightenment and Ideology: Ireland in the Digital Archive AHSEM-UA 185 Instructor: John Waters Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.  This course will investigate the problems of difference, progress and development that confronted those who sought to improve the condition of Ireland through the application of new ideas that gained currency in the 18th century Enlightenment. Although an integral part of the British Empire, Ireland was notoriously economically under-developed, culturally distinct, socially turbulent and religiously diverse. Consequently Ireland was the subject of a vast literary and political debate about how the society should be transformed, how its culture should evolve, its language adapt, and its people change their ways. At the end of the 18th century, the movement of the United Irishmen attempted to put in practice a vision of Enlightenment philosophy, first through cultural politics, then through revolutionary activity, finally through a failed military rebellion. To put these events in context, we will attempt to chart the history of ideas about society as they were applied to Ireland through two distinct approaches. We will read signal works of British and Irish Enlightenment philosophy and applied social analysis, by famous writers including Jonathan Swift, Adam Smith, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, and Maria Edgeworth, as well as works by lesser known writers who sought earnestly to solve what was known as the Irish Problem. Alongside this reading, we will conduct an experimental Digital analysis of a large corpus of works written about Ireland in the period. The course will be conducted as a research seminar with a weekly Digital Laboratory component in which students will work to contribute to the corpus of digitized books, as well as to the effort to analyze the corpus through custom-designed analytical tools.

Narrating Poverty in Brazilian Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 186 Instructor: Marta Peixoto Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m.  This course, CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH, examines literary works in various genres (novels, autobiography, short stories), and Brazilian films (Cinema Novo and after, including documentaries), that attempt to narrate the experience of poverty. We will discuss texts by Graciliano Ramos, Carolina Maria de Jesus, Clarice Lispector, Rubem Fonseca, and Patricia Melo and view films (Barren Lives, The Scavengers, The Hour of the Star, Pixote, Bus 174, City of God, Babil\u00f4nia 2000 and Black Orpheus ), in light of key questions. How do these texts reflect on the nature of representation and on the investments of author and reader in images of deprivation? How do they present the connections of poverty with violence, stigmatization, and citizenship rights? How do they frame the ethical responsibilities of the writer or film-maker, as well as of readers and spectators? What are the patterns of consumption and circulation of these texts? Cross-listed with Portuguese as PORT-UA 704.001.  Marta Peixoto is Associate Professor of Brazilian literature and culture in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.

She has also published articles on women\u2019s autobiographical writing, on the major nineteenth-century novelist Machado de Assis, among other topics and writers. Three of her recent articles center on questions of urban crisis and artistic representation in literature and film: \u201cFatos s\u00e3o pedras duras: Urban Poverty in Clarice Lispector,\u201d \u201cRio\u2019s Favelas in Recent Fiction and Film: Commonplaces of Urban Segregation,\u201d and \u201cUrban Violence and the Politics of Representation in Recent Brazilian Film.\u201d Her research and teaching interests also include lyric poetry, Brazilian music, and documentary film.  Memory and Forgetting AHSEM-UA 187 Instructor: Martha Rust and Suzanne England Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.  The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as \u201cHow is memory embodied?\u201d How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students will come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that will serve their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 800.004 and with the Silver School of Social Work as UNDSW-US 79.001. This course will count as an advanced elective towards the English major.

Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives--literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture.  Schism AHSEM-UA 189 Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.  This is an exploration of the type of conflict that results not simply from the clash of incompatible interests but from the shattering of a shared vision\u2014even if that vision may come to seem deluded. Can we find some connections between the type of concept that unites people, and the type of conflict that divides them? Can we distinguish between what people say about these things and deeper or truer realities? Do people sometimes act as though they have a concept that governs their union, even if they are not aware of it? How strong are the analogies between voluntary associations, where the unifying concept may be clearly codified and affirmed, and political associations? Is the knowledge system that informs these concepts and provides ancillary support a historic artifact? Do conceptual unions based on indoctrination face special challenges? We will explore these and other questions using a wide mix of materials from Greek tragedy to political theory to divorce narratives. One aim will be to draw on the diverse disciplinary perspectives that students bring to the table. The final project may, accordingly, take various forms, from a work of fiction, to sustained philosophical or literary analysis, to historical research.  William Klein studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy .

In previous lives he worked as a ghost writer, an editor and a carpenter (hence the title of a recent piece on one of Italy\u2019s great artists, Franca Ghitti: \u201cNaive Notes on Franca\u2019s Nails by a Former Carpenter\u201d). In 2011-12 he taught for NYU in Florence. The Future of Normal AHSEM-UA 192 Instructor: Bob Vorlicky Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.  This course explores historical and current notions of normalcy and non-normalcy as they influence and determine what is or is not visible\u2014what is or is not embodied\u2014in live theatrical representation. While the course focuses on the theatricalization of \u201cnon-normative\u201d bodies in staged representation, it also queries the absence or invisibility of other non-normative bodies. A significant goal of the course is to explore the relationship between non-normativity and invisibility on the U.S. stage. Through the study of drama, performance, and a variety of theoretical texts from different disciplines, the course surveys the kinds of theatre (originating in western cultures) that focus on the material body that challenges \u201cnormative\u201d ideologies, practices, conditions, and technologies of sexuality and gender as they relate to staged corporeality. We acknowledge the foundations of gender-bending in, for instance, the works of Euripides, Shakespeare, and Jonson, and explore more recent solo works by Kate Bornstein (M to F), Ron Athey (live body piercing and branding) and Greg Wallace (born with cerebral palsy). Intentionally, the course explores the complicated relationships that exist among bodies, identities, culture, science, and technology\u2014both on- and offstage\u2014with special attention paid to a glaringly invisible community from U.S. stage representation: the intersexed.
