As a course in new sensory urbanism the curriculum seeks to expand the traditional scope and range of the studied senses from sight (art, architecture) and sound (music), to smell, taste and touch, so as to rethink what it means to be a modern urban subject engaged in the pleasures and powers of consumption. Through lectures, readings, field trips--including day-trips in New York and a week-long research trip to Sydney--students will master established facts and concepts about contemporary urban food cultures and produce new knowledge of the same.    Restricted to students in the Global Honors program; titles and topics may differ.        MCC-UE.1310 &ndash; Culture &amp; Media in Urban China (4 pts)    What does it mean to be \"urban\" in China &amp; how is Chinese urbanism mediated by new cultural formations? In this course we will examine the culture &amp; media that define city life in China, including Chinese state &amp; popular media, television &amp; film, music, fashion, verbal art &amp; literature (in print &amp; online) &amp; visual art. we will focus on the period from the building booms of the mid-to-late nineties to the present. Students will work in teams to make presentations on urban culture, &amp; use primary sources in translation &amp; secondary sources to write individual essays. Chinese language ability appreciated but by no means required.    Restricted to students in the Global Honors program; titles and topics may differ.       MCC-UE.1416 &ndash; Borders, Barriers, and Buffers (4 pts)    The course begins with the paradoxical premise that we increasingly live in a borderless world thanks in large part the advent of new technologies which allow for the flow of goods, capital, people, &amp; ideas; but that we also simultaneously live in a more barricaded world made up of walls, barriers, &amp; borders of different kinds. Students will think through political &amp; symbolic borders &amp; their material &amp; immaterial formations. Readings which draw on examples from across the world will be included throughout the course. The course will culminate with a trip to Israel/Palestine.    Restricted to students in the Global Honors program; titles and topics may differ.       PHED-UE.1016/EDST-UE.1504 &ndash; Religion and Public Education in an International Context (4 pts)    The purpose of this course on religion &amp; public education in an international context is for us to engage together in a critical analysis of what continues to be an important contemporary issue. The seminar is designed especially for students preparing for careers in teaching - in both public &amp; private/religious schools, educational administration, educational research, or other professions which will involve them in the ongoing public debates about the uneasy relationship of religion &amp; public education in the United States &amp; other countries. The course will examine these issues historically &amp; in terms of current policy debates &amp; students will be asked to make connections to their own educational practice.           Expressive Culture          ARTCR-UE.10 &ndash; Art: Practice and Ideas (4 pts)    &ldquo;Art: Practice and Ideas&rdquo; examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create and reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting and sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, and computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, and postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, and technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical and social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time.       ARTCR-UE.55 &ndash; Art of Now (4 pts)    This course examines the current developments in contemporary art over the past decade &ndash; the art of &lsquo;now&rsquo; &ndash; from the viewpoint of an artist&rsquo;s practice and working ideas, looking at current global art production in aesthetic, economic, and social contexts. The major movements in painting, photography, sculpture, installation and performance are examined. Readings will be drawn from first hand interviews and point-of-view accounts, reviews, and critique; a major emphasis on interviews and online studio visits will accompany the texts. Guest artist lectures and off-site museum and gallery viewings will complement the weekly visual presentations and theory conversations.       ARTCR-UE.152 &ndash; The Internet and Contemporary Art (4 pts)    The Post-internet mentality &ndash; where the Internet is a way of creating and thinking, more than a device &ndash; is the basis for this class on contemporary digital art, 1970 to the present. This course looks at current Internet art; video, digital, virtual and mixed technology, and collaborative online art practices. Students will learn how artists are integrating digital technology in the production, display, and public encounter of their artwork. Lectures using images of art and assigned readings will focus on online and digital realities, the Internet as an art medium, contemporary time prosumers, digerati, online social networks, screen mentalities, spectatorship, and new visual formations. Visiting artists and critics will engage virtually and in person so students will be in direct contact with those creating the current landscape of Internet art.       AHUM-UE.1010 &ndash; International Art Film, Social Change, and the Experience of Modernity (4 pts)    This course will explore how films from a variety of historical situations and national cultures may shed light on a common experience: that of living in a society undergoing modernization. People in these situations have to cope with the loss of their old, familiar world and the emergence of a new one of hopes and challenges. Such settings are apt to give rise to dramas of existential meaning and to experimental art forms that facilitate our learning from such dramas; indeed, they produced the modernist art cinema. We will address questions rooted in this experience with a concrete focus on select cinematic works from a spectrum of non-Anglophone countries. There are no course prerequisites and all are welcome.       MPADE-UE.1278 &ndash; Dance as an Art Form (3 pts)    Dance is an integral and defining component of cultures throughout the world and throughout history. This course introduces students to dance as a live and performing art through a variety of experiences including attendance at live performances, examination of videos and theoretical texts, and physical participation in the practice and performance of dance. Through discussions, written assignments, and the creation of original dance compositions, students will explore the history and cultural relevance of a variety of forms of dance within their own lives, larger society, and the global community beyond.        MPAET-UE.60 &ndash; Introduction to Theatre as Art Form (4 pts)    This course introduces non-majors to theatre as a live and performing art through a variety of experiences including attendance at live performances, readings of play scripts and theoretical texts, and the creation of original plays. Through lectures, discussions, and written assignments, students will explore the roles of the playwright, actor, director, and designer in the production process, as well as examine the role of the audience in the live performance.       MPAJZ-UE.1278 &ndash; Jazz: An American Artform in Global Context (4 pts)    What is jazz music and how was it shaped and developed by the specific regions around the world? This class will explore the diverse musical cultures that helped shape jazz music into an original art form. Today, music from around the world has been integrated into modern jazz styles including Latin America, Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. By exploring the history and culture of specific geographic points, we hope to better understand the process of jazz through its history as a model that supports diversity in culture as well as art.    Restricted to students in the Global Honors program; titles and topics may differ.           Foreign Language           ASL-UE 91 &ndash; American Sign Language I Fundamental principles of grammar and syntax, a basic vocabulary, and conventions of conversational discourse in the deaf community. Emphasis is placed on developing the visual perception skills critical to understanding ASL. Taught in a visual-manual method using no spoken English.          Natural Sciences          CSCD-UE.33 &ndash; Voices and Listeners (4 pts)    The course provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary overview of the multifaceted role that vocal expression plays in everyday communication. Familiar voice recognition; perception of emotion, attitude, and personality; and interactions between speech and voice perception are described from sociological, psychological, physiological, and neurological perspectives. Evolutionary biology, cultural differences, singing, and uses in media and courtroom are discussed. Clinical studies examine self-awareness of vocal expression and the influence of vocal quality on personal identity. Voice as communication vehicle for speaker and listener is fully explored.       CSCD-UE.1045 &ndash; Science of Language (4 pts)    This course provides an overview of the scientific study of the human language faculty, focusing on the cognitive and neural processing mechanisms that underlie linguistic knowledge and use. We describe contemporary approaches to delineating levels of language structure and review various scientific methodologies used to study language. Topics include language knowledge and use as well as language change and variation.       NUTR-UE.119 &ndash; Nutrition and Health (3 pts)    Introduction to nutrition science and its role in health and society: nutrient characteristics, requirements, and food sources, energy balance, weight control, dietary guides and food planning, and social and economic factors that affect food production and consumption.
