The event is Tuesday, January 20, at 6:30 p.m.     Their music bridges past and present - a past where the clocks tick differently and a present where we can connect to the entire world and choose from an immeasurable number of opinions, and pick the most precious, most suitable items for our individual character. The result: A type of unique music that is inseparable from the people who perform it. It needs to take place within them, earnestly, yet with a wink.     \u201cThe most beautiful moment in a concert is when everything starts to coalesce: we with our music, our music with the audience, the audience with space and time, so that only the present moment exists with its sound and image.&quot;     The playground they are moving on contains traditional tunes and songs from Austria as well as improvisations and their own written tunes. Simon Z\u00f6chbauer was born in 1988 in Herzogenburg, Lower Austria. He performs vocals, and plays the trumpet, zither, electr. tanpura, and shruti box. Simon studies at the Vienna University of Music and Performing Arts (among others) and work as a musician and composer in Austria and abroad.     Julia Lacherstorfer was born in 1985 in Bad Hall, Upper Austria. Julia performs vocals, and plays the violin, ankle bells, and shruti box. Julia studies at the Anton Bruckner Private University in Linz (among others) and works as a freelance musician and composer in Austria and abroad.
