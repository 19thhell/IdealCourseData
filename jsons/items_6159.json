NYULMC is a member of the University Healthsystem Consortium (UHC), an organization of over 100 academic medical centers and was recognized in 2010 as a \u201ctop 10 performer\u201d in Quality and Safety within UHC.      Quality and performance improvement is a dynamic, interdisciplinary process that strives to achieve the outcomes established annually by the hospital leadership and the Board of trustees. The annual Hospital Quality and Safety Performance Improvement Program (QSPIP), which outlines the Hospital\u2019s goals, is designed to foster a culture that supports the highest possible quality patient care.\u00a0 The Departments of Nursing Quality and Performance Improvement Plan is aligned with the goals outlined in QSPIP and prides itself as a staff-driven program that showcases the excellence that is NYU Nursing.     Mission      Provide a coordinated system that continuously assesses and evaluates quality in patient care and nursing practice through a regular review of NYULMC and benchmark data    Develop, implement, and evaluate unit and service performance improvement efforts    Promote a forum for the development, discussion, and implementation of Hospitals Center wide, interdepartmental, and intradepartmental performance improvement efforts     Goals            To foster a commitment to the pursuit of quality through education of and participation of staff at all levels in interdisciplinary performance improvement efforts    To highlight the direct contribution of the nursing profession to the achievement of quality patient outcomes through the identification and trending of nurse sensitive indicators    To identify care issues that benefit from performance improvement efforts utilizing honest, data driven self assessment and reassessment    To promote and share best practice based on the evidence     Nursing Quality and Performance Improvement Council          This department-level committee provides nursing staff with an opportunity for leadership in the identification, implementation and dissemination of improvement projects at the unit, service and departmental level. All nursing staff are encouraged to participate in the monthly meetings and each service is scheduled to present outcomes from their PI projects to their peers and nursing leadership which provides an invaluable forum for discussion and sharing of best practice. These projects provide the basis for developing nursing research at NYULMC and many go on to be presented at regional and national conferences. Each clinical nursing service has a service-level Quality and Performance Improvement Council that is comprised of nursing staff and leadership from the specific clinical service. Service-specific projects include improvements in patient satisfaction, pain management, patient education, reduction of hospital acquired conditions, improved regulatory compliance and workflow.      Nursing participation in quality initiatives is also demonstrated in our Partnering for Quality program (P4Q). This program, spearheaded by the Senior VP for Patient Care Services and Chief Nursing Officer, Kimberly Glassman, PhD, RN, NEA-BC and the Chief Medical Officer, Robert Press, MD pairs Nurse Managers and Physician leaders at the unit level in the pursuit of performance improvement projects that improve the quality of care for patients and families.      Nursing staff at all levels also have the opportunity to participate in Rapid Improvement Events (RIEs) which are coordinated through our Lean Management Office. These 3-4 day intensive events, utilizing process improvement principles based on lean and Six Sigma methodology, focus on streamlining and refining specific work processes and involve staff representatives from all disciplines that are directly involved in the process. Lean Management is supporting advances in diverse areas, from patient safety and satisfaction to revenue enhancement.

NYULMC is a member of the University Healthsystem Consortium (UHC), an organization of over 100 academic medical centers and was recognized in 2010 as a \u201ctop 10 performer\u201d in Quality and Safety within UHC.      Quality and performance improvement is a dynamic, interdisciplinary process that strives to achieve the outcomes established annually by the hospital leadership and the Board of trustees. The annual Hospital Quality and Safety Performance Improvement Program (QSPIP), which outlines the Hospital\u2019s goals, is designed to foster a culture that supports the highest possible quality patient care.\u00a0 The Departments of Nursing Quality and Performance Improvement Plan is aligned with the goals outlined in QSPIP and prides itself as a staff-driven program that showcases the excellence that is NYU Nursing.     Mission      Provide a coordinated system that continuously assesses and evaluates quality in patient care and nursing practice through a regular review of NYULMC and benchmark data    Develop, implement, and evaluate unit and service performance improvement efforts    Promote a forum for the development, discussion, and implementation of Hospitals Center wide, interdepartmental, and intradepartmental performance improvement efforts     Goals            To foster a commitment to the pursuit of quality through education of and participation of staff at all levels in interdisciplinary performance improvement efforts    To highlight the direct contribution of the nursing profession to the achievement of quality patient outcomes through the identification and trending of nurse sensitive indicators    To identify care issues that benefit from performance improvement efforts utilizing honest, data driven self assessment and reassessment    To promote and share best practice based on the evidence     Nursing Quality and Performance Improvement Council          This department-level committee provides nursing staff with an opportunity for leadership in the identification, implementation and dissemination of improvement projects at the unit, service and departmental level. All nursing staff are encouraged to participate in the monthly meetings and each service is scheduled to present outcomes from their PI projects to their peers and nursing leadership which provides an invaluable forum for discussion and sharing of best practice. These projects provide the basis for developing nursing research at NYULMC and many go on to be presented at regional and national conferences. Each clinical nursing service has a service-level Quality and Performance Improvement Council that is comprised of nursing staff and leadership from the specific clinical service. Service-specific projects include improvements in patient satisfaction, pain management, patient education, reduction of hospital acquired conditions, improved regulatory compliance and workflow.      Nursing participation in quality initiatives is also demonstrated in our Partnering for Quality program (P4Q). This program, spearheaded by the Senior VP for Patient Care Services and Chief Nursing Officer, Kimberly Glassman, PhD, RN, NEA-BC and the Chief Medical Officer, Robert Press, MD pairs Nurse Managers and Physician leaders at the unit level in the pursuit of performance improvement projects that improve the quality of care for patients and families.      Nursing staff at all levels also have the opportunity to participate in Rapid Improvement Events (RIEs) which are coordinated through our Lean Management Office. These 3-4 day intensive events, utilizing process improvement principles based on lean and Six Sigma methodology, focus on streamlining and refining specific work processes and involve staff representatives from all disciplines that are directly involved in the process. Lean Management is supporting advances in diverse areas, from patient safety and satisfaction to revenue enhancement.
