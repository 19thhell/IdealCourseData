Required Courses Choose two of the courses listed below.      Producing Essentials NCRD-UT 1006 There is a need for quality producers in all of today\u2019s major creative fields: film, television, music, theatre, dance and new media. A producer with a firm knowledge of thecraft, a discerning eye for material, fundraising ability, a grasp of the law, cash flow, people and ethics, is rare. This is a specialized course designed to provide students with a framework for understanding the dynamics of producing \u2013 as an art form and a business profession \u2013 and for completing a creative product in the entertainment &amp; media industries. Students are introduced to the basic concepts, terms, and principles that apply to the role of producer in the entertainment &amp; media industries along with the specific job functions that are required to effectively and efficiently complete a production. The course aims to build a body of knowledge and information through understanding the various disciplines that cut across all the competencies required for the producer to effectively function as a key member and in most cases, the leader of the creative and business team, assembled to complete a project. Non-credit tuition: $3,575 View course schedule .      Media Moguls In The 20th Century NCRD-UT 562      A study of the origins of the performing arts and entertainment industries in America at the beginning of the 20th Century, and the alchemy that was created when new technologies in film and sound recording were introduced. This course will attempt to track the American entertainment industry from its plebian origins through its rise to becoming the predominant mass entertainment culture in the world. The class will discover the origins of the production practices that are employed in the entertainment industry today by following the legendary characters, movie moguls and media titans of the early 20 th Century, and the companies they built. The emphasis will be on the way the visionaries of the time impacted seemingly risk-averse systems to invigorate and sometimes completely revolutionize them. These innovative men and women include Louis B. Mayer, George Lucas, Maya Deren, Shirley Clark, Alan Landsberg, Nam Jun Paik, Lucille Ball, Russell Simmons, Robert Stigwood, Clive Davis, Julie Taymor, Robert Whitehead and Steve Jobs. Non-credit tuition: $3,575 View course schedule .      Seminar: Script Analysis NCRD-UT 1084         This class is designed to help the students analyze a film script. Plot and character development, character dialogue, foreground, background, and story are all examined. Using feature films, we will highlight these script elements rather than the integrated experience of the script, performance, directing, and editing elements of the film. Assignments will include two script analyses. Non-credit tuition: $3,575 Projection fee: $72 View course schedule .      Electives  Choose two of the seven courses listed below.      Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Filmmaking NCRD-UT 43      Every student will conceive, produce, direct and edit five short projects (3 silent and 2 with sound) with digital filmmaking technology. Working in crews of four, students will be exposed to a variety of specific assignments in visual storytelling that feature a broad spectrum of technical, aesthetic, craft and logistical problems to be solved. Collaborating with other students through rotating crew positions will be a central focus of all production work. Lectures, labs, critiques, technical seminars, screenings and written production books will be an important component of this class. All student work is screened and discussed in class. Students should not schedule any other course on the same days as Sight &amp; Sound: Filmmaking. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule .      Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Studio NCRD-UT 51      The course provides an in-depth exploration of the creative capabilities (technical, logistical, aesthetic) of producing narrative based studio production work in a multiple camera television studio environment. Students will be trained in working with actors and learning how to connect script and performance to the production of  four short studio based projects (each of increasing complexity). Students will have the opportunity to develop a single idea into a full-scale production that  will be produced \u201clive\u201d in the studio at the end of the semester. The fundamental skills learned in this class will serve as a foundation for all narrative, experimental and documentary based production work and will be applicable in all intermediate and advanced level production classes. Students will receive training in portable field equipment (for recording supplemental B-roll footage) Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule .      Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Documentary NCRD-UT 80      The course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, as well as hands on directing, shooting, sound-recording and editing, students rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction storytelling for video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule .      Producing for Film    NCRD-UT 1095 An examination of the creative, organizational, and managerial roles of the producer in narrative motion pictures. Topics include how a production company is formed, creating and obtaining properties, financing, budgeting, cost control, distribution. The course gives specific attention to the problems in these areas that will be faced by students as future professional directors, production managers, or writers. Each student is expected to breakdown, schedule, and budget a feature film (90 minutes or longer) of their choosing. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 Projection fee: $54 View course schedule      Producing for TV NCRD-UT 1028 This course provides fundamental and practical instruction in the step-by-step realization of a television program. While productions will not be implemented through the class, students will individually serve as executive producers on projects of their own choosing, based on assignments by the instructor (based on student submissions which include news and cultural documentaries, performance and variety shows, and dramatic works). Student producers will engage in a detailed pre-production phase, which covers research, concept, format development, securing of rights and permissions, pitching to networks and studios, contracts and agreements, formation of the production plan, budget development, assembling staff and crew, identifying on-air talent, determining locations, photo and film archive research, refining the shooting schedule and budget plan. Analysis of why some projects succeed and others fail, an overview. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 Projection fee: $54 View course schedule .  Production Management: Boards and Budgets NCRD-UT 1296      An introductory course in professional production management that provides the student with the information and practice of managing the making of a feature film or television show. Film &amp; television production has many more requirements than simply securing a camera, stock and actors, and the course will explore those management elements that a filmmaker needs to fulfill in order to shoot &amp; complete. We will examine the structure of the crew and the collaborative responsibilities of crew members; the legal issues of permits, insurance, rights, clearances and permissions; Screen Actors Guild requirements, the management of the production including scheduling, budgeting, transportation, and the production's responsibilities to cast and crew. We will pay particular attention to professional practices concerning the structure of the workday, hours and turn around time and safety issues that are the responsibility of the producer, director, DP and shop steward. The course will explore techniques for on-set casting, location scouting, tech scouts and read-throughs.   In addition to the class project, in which a feature film is scheduled and budgeted, each student will be required to find an advanced television or film student project of more than 15 pages form which to prepare a production book by the end of the course that will include a final marked script, script breakdown pages, shooting schedule, strip board, budget, cast crew and location lists. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 Projection fee: $54 View course schedule .      Producing with Bob Power: A Master Class NCRD-UT 8580      If production had to be summed up in one sentence, it might be: \u2018taking what is unique and special about the artist and using recording technologies to put that uniqueness and specialness in the best possible frame.\u2019 Sounds simple. But the journey from great singer- good song to a great record is often a circuitous and grueling journey. Acclaimed and award-winning Producer/ Mixer/ Recordist Bob Power (Erkyah Badu, Common, D\u2019Angelo, A Tribe Called Quest) will present a balance of practical and conceptual information designed to expose students to the various recording and production techniques he uses to create his consistent brand of effective production. During the course of the master class, Power and the students will build a production from the ground up: students will participate and observe as Power produces a world-class New York City talent, working in NYU\u2019s state of the art studios. Additionally, part of each day will be devoted to a presentation and discussion of both Power\u2019s and the students\u2019 production work. The course culminates with a networking session/lunch where students will have the opportunity to have their own personal productions critiqued by the instructor.

Additionally, part of each day will be devoted to a presentation and discussion of both Power\u2019s and the students\u2019 production work. The course culminates with a networking session/lunch where students will have the opportunity to have their own personal productions critiqued by the instructor.

The joint MBA/MFA degree is a partnership of two world-class programs, NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business and Kanbar Institute of Film & Television at the Tisch School of the Arts.     The MBA/MFA degree is a three-year program that enables students to pursue both degrees simultaneously. It attracts the very best producing candidates by focusing on both the creative and business sides of film. Designed to be the most comprehensive of its kind, using the top faculty and resources of each school, the dual-degree program produces highly employable individuals sought by the major film studios, independent production companies, and the major television studios and networks.     The curriculum is rigorous and demanding. It provides all the traditional MBA skills, plus courses dealing with the business side of the entertainment industry and a full MFA curriculum in filmmaking. Students must be accepted by both schools and spend about half their time taking courses at each. In addition, students become highly involved in film projects and most find time for internships sometime during their program. Our overall goal is to prepare the next generation of industry leaders who understand the complexity of the business and at the same time understand what it takes to make great films.
