When you complete the dual degree program, you will be eligible for New York State certification as a teacher of mathematics for grades 7-12.       Overview    Eligibility and Requirements    Junior/Senior Year Courses    MA Courses    Advising       Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.    Overview    The master&rsquo;s program in mathematics education is taught by full- and part-time faculty with a wide range of classroom experience, scholarly publications and long-time involvement with professional associations. The program emphasizes sound content knowledge in mathematics; current issues and trends in mathematics education; state of the art instructional materials; pedagogical approaches that promote students' conceptual understanding and address anticipated learning difficulties; and teaching methods that provoke critical thought and foster inquiry-based learning. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.       Eligibility and Requirements for the BA Mathematics/MA Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12 Program    CAS students majoring in mathematics are eligible for this dual degree program. Students complete 13 credits of the 43 credits for the MA while they are still undergraduates. These 13 credits are specified below.    Students must earn a B or better in all Steinhardt courses in order for these to be applied to the MA dual degree. Students must complete all requirements of their major as well as college-wide requirements prior to matriculating at Steinhardt.    Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.       Steinhardt Graduate Courses to be Completed During Junior or Senior Year    During their junior or senior year, CAS math majors complete 12 credits in Teaching Math in place of other electives. These 12 credits count as electives toward the BA degree in math from CAS.

When you complete the dual degree program, you will be eligible for New York State certification as a teacher of mathematics for grades 7-12.       Overview    Eligibility and Requirements    Junior/Senior Year Courses    MA Courses    Advising       Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.    Overview    The master&rsquo;s program in mathematics education is taught by full- and part-time faculty with a wide range of classroom experience, scholarly publications and long-time involvement with professional associations. The program emphasizes sound content knowledge in mathematics; current issues and trends in mathematics education; state of the art instructional materials; pedagogical approaches that promote students' conceptual understanding and address anticipated learning difficulties; and teaching methods that provoke critical thought and foster inquiry-based learning. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.       Eligibility and Requirements for the BA Mathematics/MA Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12 Program    CAS students majoring in mathematics are eligible for this dual degree program. Students complete 13 credits of the 43 credits for the MA while they are still undergraduates. These 13 credits are specified below.    Students must earn a B or better in all Steinhardt courses in order for these to be applied to the MA dual degree. Students must complete all requirements of their major as well as college-wide requirements prior to matriculating at Steinhardt.    Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.       Steinhardt Graduate Courses to be Completed During Junior or Senior Year    During their junior or senior year, CAS math majors complete 12 credits in Teaching Math in place of other electives. These 12 credits count as electives toward the BA degree in math from CAS.

Mathematics Minor    The requirement for a mathematics minor is four 4-credit courses in the department numbered MATH-UA 120 or higher. Of these four courses MATH-UA 211, 212 or 213 may not be used if you have taken Calculus. Although courses transferred from other colleges may count towards the minor, at least two courses for the minor must be taken at NYU. Students pursuing majors that require mathematics courses may follow this minor, as long as two of the four courses do not apply simultaneously to the requirements for their major.      * Courses taken under the pass/fail option are not counted toward the minor.   * A grade of C or better is required in all courses to count toward the minor.      Joint Mathematics and Computer Science Minor    The requirements are the following four courses:       MATH-UA 121 Calculus I    MATH-UA 122 Calculus II    CSCI-UA 101 Introduction to Computer Science    CSCI-UA 102 Data Structures    *Students who wish to double-count courses for the math portion of the minor and another requirement may count at most two such courses toward the minor.   * Courses taken under the pass/fail option are not counted toward the minor.   * A grade of C or better is required in all courses to count toward the minor.     Advanced Mathematical Methods Minor   The mathematical methods minor will consist of four distinct components. Students will be required to take at least one Stern course to fulfill this minor.   1.Linear Algebra MATH-UA 140 (Formerly V63.0140) or equivalent 4 units.  2.Introduction to the Theory of Probability STAT-UB 14 (Formerly C22.0014) 3 units.  3.Numerical Analysis MATH-UA 252 (Formerly V63.0252) 4 units.  OR Numerical Methods I MATH-GA 2010 (Formerly G63.2010) 3 units.  4. One course from the advanced course list below:      -Ordinary Differential Equations MATH-UA 262 (Formerly V63.0262) 4 units.    -Partial Differential Equations MATH-UA 263 (Formerly V63.0263) 4 units.    -Statistical Inference and Regression Analysis STAT-UB 15 (Formerly C22.0015) 3 units.    -Introduction to Stochastic Processes STAT-UB 21 (Formerly C22.0021) 3 units.    -Analysis MATH-UA 325 (Formerly V63.0325) 4 units.      Notes  All students must take at least one Stern course in order to meet minor requirements. If a student has completed the CAS version of Probability, STAT-UB 14 should not be taken. Instead, please select one of the following:     - Statistical Inference and Regression Analysis STAT-UB 15 (Formerly C22.0015)  3 units.   - Introduction to Stochastic Processes STAT-UB 21 (Formerly C22.0021) 3 units.   - Students who have the equivalent of MATH-UA 140 should substitute a more advanced course from the list above.    Mathematics Education Minor for Math Majors   The Mathematics Education Minor (for Mathematics Majors) enables you to complete course work as an undergraduate in CAS that will reduce the number of credits required of a Steinhardt School of Education M.A. degree in Teachers of Mathematics, Grades 7-12 that will fulfill the requirements for Initial teacher certification. The master's degree will require 30 credits including student teaching internships beyond the bachelor's degree.    Ideally you would want to declare the minor and begin taking these courses during your first semester of junior year. Please be advised that most of these courses require a field work component consisting of classroom observation and participation. For course descriptions, please see the current Steinhardt School of Education's Undergraduate Bulletin at http://www.steinhardt.nyu.edu/bulletin.              \u00a9 NEW YORK UNIVERSITY"}]}]
