Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict?

Topics include: descriptive statistics; introduction to probability; sampling; statistical inference concerning means, standard deviations, and proportions; correlation; analysis of variance; linear regression, including multiple regression analysis. Applications to empirical situations are an integral part of the course. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.

Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      Voices from the Margin: Modern Chinese and Sinophone Writers - GCHN-SHU 263 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the modern and contemporary Chinese-speaking world is diverse, vast, and challenging for the migrant and exilic minds whose creative energies are often driven by their poignant insights to the turbulent events around them. Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.                              Interactive Media and Technology                                                    Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.

It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.

Topics include: descriptive statistics; introduction to probability; sampling; statistical inference concerning means, standard deviations, and proportions; correlation; analysis of variance; linear regression, including multiple regression analysis. Applications to empirical situations are an integral part of the course. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.

Prerequisite: Microeconomics or equivalent.   This course examines the forces driving toward globalization: the integration of national business activities into globally competitive markets. International trade is a key driver of global integration. The role of comparative advantage as a determinant of the location of production is examined. Also examined are the reasons for and effects of government policies that create impediments to international trade. The second part of the course surveys the role of money and finance in global economic activity. The role of exchange rates as key variables in global finance is introduced. Also examined is the role of government policies toward the foreign exchange market, including the choice between fixed and floating exchange rates and the use of exchange controls to create impediments to currency exchanges. The course also introduces the concept of foreign direct investment and discusses the rising importance of multinational corporations.                                Experimental Discovery in the Natural World                                                  Where the City Meets the Sea - CCEX-SHU 116 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.                                Global China Studies                                                  Social and Cultural Debates in 20th Century China - GCHN-SHU 231 - 4 points                               \u201cOur present trouble lies in our clinging to old institutions without knowing how to change,\u201d Kang Youwei wrote in a letter to the Emperor in 1898. Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      Voices from the Margin: Modern Chinese and Sinophone Writers - GCHN-SHU 263 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the modern and contemporary Chinese-speaking world is diverse, vast, and challenging for the migrant and exilic minds whose creative energies are often driven by their poignant insights to the turbulent events around them. Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.

The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.

An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course will cover the first five chapters of the textbook which is developed surrounding five real-life business cases. These five companies are all multinational that have successfully operated in China by adapting their strategies to the special needs of the Chinese market. By reading, discussing, and performing communicative tasks related to those cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d, thus acquiring a better understanding of China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. The case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business within China.\u201d    In order to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the business cases, clips of the selected television interviews and talk shows will be used to accomplish the following four goals: First, the content of the textbook and the background information offered by the supplementary media materials complement each other. Second, key terms and expressions in the textbook will be repeated in the learning process to help students reinforce the knowledge. Third, in terms of cross-usage between colloquial and written language, students will have the opportunity to supplement their reading of written texts with the experience of watching television shows on the same or similar topics, which may help them understand the distinctions between the two language styles and accurately utilize both language registers to express their own ideas in different settings. Fourth, the authentic visual materials can help close the gap between pedagogy and the real world, most effectively enabling students to become familiar with all varieties of Chinese accents, \u2013 including those of Hong Kong, Taiwan and even foreigners speaking Chinese \u2013 thereby strengthening students\u2019 abilities of practical application in the real world. In order to expand and update students\u2019 knowledge on various business-related issues, in addition to the business case 2 analysis, supplementary listening, reading, writing exercises will also be provided in class. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues; discussion of Chinese business laws, translation of business terms and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China or Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) expand business vocabulary and strengthen the communication skills in real business settings; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about China and the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of authentic Chinese media materials; (4) improve reading, writing and translation skills of business terminologies and documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes. Class will be conducted in Chinese. Prerequisite: Consent of Instructor and Advanced Chinese language.

An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.

Managerial Skills - MGMT-SHU 21 - 3 points                               Many companies bestow a management title on key talent and expect appropriate behavior to follow. That is not the most effective way to develop future business leaders. Your expertise will take you just so far. Increasing self-awareness and being open to feedback are important first steps in leading today's business for tomorrow's results. DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT SKILLS is a course that focuses primarily on the practical aspects of managing. This course is highly interactive and, while based on solid research, it stresses a hands-on approach to improving your management skills. The focus is on developing:   Your Personal Skills: self-awareness; managing stress; solving problems &amp; creativity  What behaviors help or get in your way as you strive for personal/professional success?  How do your values influence your decisions and problem-solving approaches?  How do your learning styles help or hinder how you handle ethical dilemmas?, etc.)  Your Interpersonal Skills: coaching; counseling; supportive communication; gaining power &amp; influence; motivating self &amp; others; managing conflict  Your Group Skills: empowering &amp; delegating; building teams, leading change, running meetings.

You will not only learn about management skills but you will begin to apply those skills in class, at work, at home, etc., to help you become a more effective business leader. This is not the course for you, if you prefer classes where you can sit passively by and be an &quot;academic tourist&quot;.  In the self-assessment step you assess your own skills in the topic under discussion. Usually, these will be at the beginning of each chapter. Class lectures and discussions will involve such topics as: self-awareness, creative problem-solving, communication, stress management, gaining power, motivating others, managing conflict, empowering others, giving and receiving feedback, delegating, and team building, etc...not necessarily in that order. You will analyze, write about, practice and apply these topics through case studies, group exercises, and being responsible to teach some topics to the class.   NOTE: We will NOT be reading each chapter in class. The text is YOUR resource to use as we go along as a starting point. Use it. We will seldom refer to it during class. It can serve as the basis for class discussion and reflection. However, it is not to be considered the only resource available to you. This is your opportunity to explore these topics through outside sources, including but not limited to professional and popular journals/books/organizations, Human Resources professionals, web sites, etc. Your chance to network beyond your comfort zone!

Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                              Economics                                                    Principles of Macroeconomics - ECON-SHU 1 - 4 points                               Focuses on the economy as a whole (the &quot;macroeconomy&quot;). Begins with the meaning and measurement of important macroeconomic data (on unemployment, inflation, and production), then turns to the behavior of the overall economy. Topics include long-run economic growth and the standard of living; the causes and consequences of economic booms and recessions; the banking system and the Federal Reserve; the stock and bond markets; and the role of government policy.                                                                      Principles of Microeconomics - ECON-SHU 2 - 4 points                               Focuses on individual economic decision-makers\u2014households, business firms, and government agencies\u2014and how they are linked together. The emphasis is on decision making by households and firms and how these decisions shape our economic life. Explores the different environments in which businesses sell their products, hire workers, and raise funds to expand their operations; the economic effects of trade between nations; and the effects of various government policies, such as minimum-wage legislation, rent controls, antitrust laws, and more.

This course is divided into four chronological periods: Antiquity\u2014from the period of the \u2018central kingdoms\u2019 to the formation of the early empire; Middle Period\u2014China Among Equals; Early Modern: 1350-1910\u2014China, Global Trade, and Imperialism; Modern: 1910-present\u2014China Redux                                History                                                  China Encounters the World - HIST-SHU 312 - 4 points                               This is a lecture course on China\u2019s encounters with the world in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The course analyzes the age-old Chinese \u201cCentral Kingdom\u201d self-image and how the image was overturned during modern times in face of Western and Japanese challenges; it explores the Chinese \u201cvictim mentality\u201d and its impact on China\u2019s modern international experience; it examines China\u2019s foreign policy issues in the context of its political, economic, social and cultural developments in broader terms; it also pays special attention to the role of \u201chuman agencies\u201d in the shaping of historical processes.                                                                    The New Cold War History - HIST-SHU 325 - 4 points                               This is a reading and research seminar with an emphasis on the \u201cnew \u201cCold War history\u2014a scholarly phenomenon emerging in the 1990s, along with the end of the global Cold War and the new opportunities to conduct multiarchival and mutli-source research for scholars of international history. Students in this class will be exposed to various new interpretations, new methods of research, and new ways of thinking associated with the new Cold War history studies. Readings in this class will be focused on the scholarship that has appeared since the early and mid-1990s. Students are required to write several books reviews and a comprehensive review essay, as well as to present and critique the comprehensive review essay in class. The ultimate purpose of the course is to help students take the Cold War as a useful reference to pursue a better understanding of the challenges facing the human race in the 21st century.                                                                    The Global Space Age - HIST-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Over the course of the twentieth century the infinite void that surrounds planet Earth has stimulated the human imagination as never before. For several decades, anticipation of human spaceflight was intimately bound with futuristic visions of technoscientific progress, while space exploration became key to societal self-images. This course charts the rise and fall of the Age of Space from a global perspective. Individual sessions will be devoted to the \u2018rocket fad\u2019 of the Weimar Republic, Nazi \u2018wonder weapons\u2019, the so-called Sputnik shock and the American moon landings, as well as providing an introduction to the historical origins of techno-nationalism, from the Cold War to today\u2019s Space Race in Asia.                                                                    Moments of Europe - HIST-SHU 232 - 4 points                               This course will provide a broad introduction to the history of Europe since the French Revolution. Organized around eight exemplary \u2018moments of Europe\u2019 spanning two centuries, it will familiarize students with some of the principal themes and methods involved in the writing of Modern European History. Structured chronologically, individual sessions will be devoted to the revolutions of the early nineteenth century, processes of nationbuilding, fin-de-si\u00e8cle culture, the causes, experiences and effects of the First and Second World Wars, the transeuropean protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to the crucial question of whether a distinctive European identity has developed over time. Materials used include political treatises, fiction, images and film.                                                                    Histories & Politics of Noise - HIST-SHU 303 - 4 points                               In this seminar, students will consider the idea that \u201cnoise\u201d has a history, and that its history dates long before the industrial revolution\u2019s ratcheting up of noise levels due to heavy machinery and the reproduction and amplification of sound through electronic technologies. Some noises pierce our ears and disrupt both our hearing and our thinking. In contrast, background noises may be loud, persistent, and even harmful to our ears, but they suffuse our everyday lives so fully that we can ignore them. Despite our daily subjective encounters with noise, can noise have a political meaning as well, one that transcends our individual experiences with din and discord, cacophony and clamor? This course explores noise\u2019s relationship to history and politics. By spending the semester reading, talking, and writing about noise, we will seek to comprehend it rather than contain it.                                                                    European Religion from the Reformation to Enlightenment - HIST-SHU 341 - 4 points                               European Christendom exploded in the sixteenth century, creating a fragmented and fractious religious landscape that still marks Europe (and Christianity worldwide) to this day. In this undergraduate lecture course, students will examine the significant changes European Christendom experienced between the Protestant and Catholic Reformations through the Enlightenment, and will explore the impact of new religious dogmas, beliefs, practices, and institutions upon the broader order of European politics, society, and culture. The readings, which consist of both primary and secondary sources, will demonstrate that the religious changes in this period shaped not only the thinking of theologians and clergymen, but also affected the everyday lives of people throughout Europe. Furthermore, the course will examine how various denominations of European Christianity participated in Europe\u2019s commercial, colonial, and imperial projects in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Students will thus also consider the interactions, both within and beyond Europe, between European Christianity and other world religions.                              Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                Interactive Media Arts                                                  Interactive Performance - INTM-SHU 171 - 4 points                               Digital content has become an important aspect of performance and the performing arts. This course will cover the challenges and possibilities of creating and incorporating interactive media in live and unpredictable environments such as the stage, a concert hall, or an outdoor venue. Programming performative interfaces and creating physical computing props will be the primary vehicles for the class. Prior programming or performing experience is not required. Communications Lab is a prerequisite but can be waived with proven experience in digital image processing. The performance discipline, being an inherently collaborative arena, places heavy emphasis on teamwork. An open mind to work with other artists, technologists and creative leaders is a must. Students are expected to present a live staged performance during the semester.  Prerequisite: Communications Lab.                                                                      Media and Participation - INTM-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.  This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.  This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.  The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.                                                                      Solar Solutions: The Sun - INTM-SHU 240 - 4 points                               Solar power is on track to be a major contributor to renewable energy systems of the future. Small scale photovoltaic cells can provide energy directly at point of use without the expense of an electricity grid and with the added benefit that the energy is free and non-polluting. This class examines how photovoltaic cells can be incorporated into interactive art, internet enabled devices and anything in between. We will look at the science behind various photovoltaic panels, calculate power requirements, and build our understanding about panel assembly and use. Among other things, students will experiment with solar circuits, BEAM robotics (Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics) and how to use photovoltaic cells with micro-controllers. Throughout the semester students will design a series of conceptual paper prototypes and physical prototypes as solutions to artistic and design challenges given throughout the course.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab                                                                      Street Food & Urban Farming - INTM-SHU 250 - 4 points                               This course introduces and makes use of digital tools (audio, video and mapping technologies) to research and record an immersive engagement with the city. It also includes a lab-based workshop in interactive media that is designed around a relevant theme. This semester the course focuses on street food &amp; urban farming.   The preservation, adaptation and disappearance of street food raise many issues that are central to contemporary Shanghai: globalization, creativity and cultural heritage, urbanization, the informal economy, and the environment. This course examines these topics by focusing on the following questions: How is Shanghai working to both integrate and exclude its migrant population? What room is there for itinerant vendors and the informal markets of the streets in the 21st century metropolis? What role does creativity play in the attempts to preserve the city\u2019s culinary heritage? How does street food contribute to the city\u2019s attempts to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for its ever-growing population?   Adding an extra dimension to our analysis of food in the city, the course will include an intensive workshop on urban farming led by experts in the field. This will involve; an introduction to the challenges and opportunities of urban farming in China; a tour to a local urban garden, and a hands-on component aimed at building a hydroponic window farm in the IMA lab.                                                                    Expressing Data - INTM-SHU 270 - 2 points                               Human beings are producing, consuming and sharing data at any given moment. However, what kinds of data are meaningful to us? How do we capture and collect that data? What are the best ways to present it? What stories do we want to tell with data? This course will explore these questions and more. Students will learn basic techniques for data collection and filtering. Student projects can be digitial, physical, visual, musical, or (with approval) take any form imagined.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab.                                                                      Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Communications Lab - INTM-SHU 120 - 4 points                               Communications Lab: An introductory course designed to provide students with the digital toolkit. The forms and uses of new communications technologies, including digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and basic web development, are explored in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, readings, and discussion. Principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                Literature                                                  World Drama: Class Conception - LIT-SHU 150 - 4 points                               This course attempts to infuse global content and employ global perspectives in studying the classics from great theatrical traditions of the world. To examine the classics from ancient Greece through Renaissance Europe to Restoration England along with those from classical China, India and Japan is to transform how they are understood; also transformed is one\u2019s understanding of drama when studying Sophocles, Kalidassa, Shakespeare, Tang Xianzu, Chikamatsu and Moli\u00e8re in the same sequence. The objective is to deepen our understanding of the diverse aesthetic principles and cultural values that continue to impact today's theatre and drama around the world.  This course is an upper level elective for NYU Shanghai Humanities majors and NYU New York English majors.                                                                      Hispanic Cities in Translation - LIT-SHU 224 - 4 points                               This course introduces twentieth century narratives of urban life from Spain and Latin America. Through artistic and cultural depictions, the urban hubs of Barcelona, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Havana and New York can be read as archaeological sites of history and memory. We will read and discuss the novels, short stories and poetry of diverse authors including Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alejo Carpentier and Octavio Paz, working with translations of their work in English. Using images, newspaper accounts, filmic and documentary representations, students will analyze and distinguish specific national, regional and linguistic contexts, while grappling with larger thematic notions of intellectual, literary, and artistic migration across national borders.

Prerequisite: None.                                                                    Philosophy of Science - PHIL-SHU 90 - 4 points                               This is a survey course in general philosophy of science. Our topics include: Is scientific knowledge different from other forms of knowledge? Should the history of science be seen as an ever-increasing advance of knowledge? Given that most scientific theories have turned out to be false, are we justified in believing that our current theories are true? What are scientific explanations, and what makes an explanation better than another? Do the laws of nature govern the world or simply encapsulate some interesting patterns in the world? What is the relationship between more and less fundamental scientific theories? We will examine these questions through readings drawn from both the history and philosophy of science. Prerequisites: None.                              Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Methods of Social Research - SOCS-SHU 141 - 4 points                               This is an introduction to research methods in the social sciences. It is intended to provide a foundation for an understanding of the major approaches in the social sciences to the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, and the specification and testing of theories. Special attention will be given to new methods developed to study online contents, the Internet and social media (e.g., online flow, audiences, virality and impact).  The course covers the logic of scientific inquiry and various research techniques such as experimentation, scientific sampling, survey research, field methods, archival data, and quantitative analysis that are commonly used by researchers in economics, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. The most basic goal of the class is to provide students with sufficient understanding of the basic elements of research design to be critical readers of research publications in the social sciences. In particular, they should be able to understand how the researchers arrived at their conclusions, assess whether the design of the study is adequate to support them, and possibly identify shortcomings in the design that would affect the conclusions. After completing this course students should have an overall sense of the range of methodologies for data collection and analysis available to the social science researcher, and the elements of study design required to ensure the results will actually be informative. This is not a statistics or quantitative methods class, and there will be no systematic instruction in the use of statistical software, or other quantitative analysis of data. Students seeking training in social statistics should take a course in social statistics.

Creative Writing                                                  Introduction to Creative Writing - WRIT-SHU 159 - 4 points                               This introductory course is designed for students who love to read and write creatively and who are interested in developing skills in both of these areas. We will focus mostly on fiction, with a smaller emphasis given to poetry and creative nonfiction, and we will spend the semester using these modes of creative writing to engage imaginatively and thoughtfully with the world. We will work hard in these efforts. Learning to interpret and analyze what we read is invaluable in developing our own skills as writers; assigned readings (mostly from contemporary authors) will stimulate discussions and provide models for what creative writing is and can be. Students will be expected to share their own projects in a writing workshop setting.

Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict?

The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                                                                    Paper Art: History and Practice CCCF-SHU 127 - 4 points                                Beginning with the Chinese arts of Zhezhi (paper folding) and Jianzhi (paper cutting) the paper craft movement has roots on all continents. This course reviews the history of both Chinese and international traditions, in addition to examining contemporary practices. Additionally, students will have hands-on experience through weekly exercises in the fundamentals of paper engineering techniques and basic conductive materials, creating movable books and sculptures.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be needed to provide a better answer or solution.  Prerequisite: CCSC-112                          Global China Studies                                                  20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      The Concept of China - GCHN-SHU 110 - 4 points                               From the Warring States period to the present, what have Chinese and others understood to be the meaning of \u201cChina,\u201d and what have been the broad implications of this understanding? This course is divided into four chronological periods: Antiquity\u2014from the period of the \u2018central kingdoms\u2019 to the formation of the early empire; Middle Period\u2014China Among Equals; Early Modern: 1350-1910\u2014China, Global Trade, and Imperialism; Modern: 1910-present\u2014China Redux                                                                      Digital Chinese Humanities - GCHN-SHU 201 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to computational thinking with specific reference to Global China Studies, and provides a foundation for future research. Areas of focus may include the creation, enhancement, and analysis of digitized written texts, especially primary sources; methodologies for the use of the internet as a research and translation tool; the production and processing of photographs: audio recordings: video clips: and geospatial data. Prerequisite: None.                          Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.                          Interactive Media and Technology                                                    Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Great Ideas in Mathematics - MATH-SHU 10 - 4 points                               This one semester course serves as an introduction to great ideas in mathematics. During the course we will examine a variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. 1) A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? 2) Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? 3) Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa!). 4) Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. 5) Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding? Why is math a liberal art?                                                                    Linear Algebra I - MATH-SHU 117 - 4 points                               Linear systems appear throughout the applied sciences; examples include chemical equations, electrical networks, and heat distribution. This course covers linear algebra and its applications. Topics discussed include systems of linear equations, matrices and their determinants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, quadratic forms, and matrix decompositions, all with a view towards applications. Prerequisite: MATH-SHU 110.                                                                    Probability and Statistics - MATH-SHU 150 - 4 points                               Probability and statistics continue to have increasing relevance in all of the applied sciences.

Topics will include: principles of brain organization; structure and ultrastructure of neurons; neurophysiology and biophysics of excitable cells; synaptic transmission; neurotransmitter systems and neurochemistry; neuropharmacology; neuroendocrine relations; molecular biology of neurons; development and plasticity of the brain; aging and diseases of the nervous system; organization of sensory and motor systems; structure and function of cerebral cortex; modeling of neural systems. Prerequisite: CCSC-110.                            Social Foundations                                                  Global Cultural Heritage - CCSF-SHU 125 - 4 points                               In this course we explore the special place of &quot;cultural heritage&quot; in global life today. We will trace the journeys of cultural heritage items around the world \u2014 from the war trophies and curiosity cabinets of history, to our modern era\u2019s museums, and the global movements in antiquities, art, and other objects from the global South to collectors and museums in the global North, through looting, smuggling, and trade. Topics we\u2019ll investigate include &quot;biographical objects&quot; and the anthropology and psychology of collecting; the social life of objects of desire; the construction of value and knowledge in the representation and display of such objects; the beginnings of museums and their global spread; the concepts of national and global cultural heritage; as well as a series of ongoing international legal and moral battles over heritage, including cases related to China.                                                                    Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.

Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict?

Topics include: descriptive statistics; introduction to probability; sampling; statistical inference concerning means, standard deviations, and proportions; correlation; analysis of variance; linear regression, including multiple regression analysis. Applications to empirical situations are an integral part of the course. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.

Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      Voices from the Margin: Modern Chinese and Sinophone Writers - GCHN-SHU 263 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the modern and contemporary Chinese-speaking world is diverse, vast, and challenging for the migrant and exilic minds whose creative energies are often driven by their poignant insights to the turbulent events around them. Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.                              Interactive Media and Technology                                                    Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.

It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.

Pre-req: CHIN-SHU 302                                                                    Intro to Business Chinese - CHIN-SHU 411 - 4 points                               This course is designed for those who have studied Mandarin to the intermedia high or advanced level (or equivalent). The main goal of the course is to continuously enhance students\u2019 Chinese proficiency while, at the same time, preparing them for working more comfortably and confidently in a Chinese business environment. In recent years, along with the rapid growth of Chinese economy, issues on Chinese business and economy became a hot topic. Following this trend, the course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding of the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course will cover the first five chapters of the textbook which is developed surrounding five real-life business cases. These five companies are all multinational that have successfully operated in China by adapting their strategies to the special needs of the Chinese market. By reading, discussing, and performing communicative tasks related to those cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d, thus acquiring a better understanding of China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. The case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business within China.\u201d    In order to enhance students\u2019 understanding of the business cases, clips of the selected television interviews and talk shows will be used to accomplish the following four goals: First, the content of the textbook and the background information offered by the supplementary media materials complement each other. Second, key terms and expressions in the textbook will be repeated in the learning process to help students reinforce the knowledge. Third, in terms of cross-usage between colloquial and written language, students will have the opportunity to supplement their reading of written texts with the experience of watching television shows on the same or similar topics, which may help them understand the distinctions between the two language styles and accurately utilize both language registers to express their own ideas in different settings. Fourth, the authentic visual materials can help close the gap between pedagogy and the real world, most effectively enabling students to become familiar with all varieties of Chinese accents, \u2013 including those of Hong Kong, Taiwan and even foreigners speaking Chinese \u2013 thereby strengthening students\u2019 abilities of practical application in the real world. In order to expand and update students\u2019 knowledge on various business-related issues, in addition to the business case 2 analysis, supplementary listening, reading, writing exercises will also be provided in class. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues; discussion of Chinese business laws, translation of business terms and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China or Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) expand business vocabulary and strengthen the communication skills in real business settings; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about China and the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of authentic Chinese media materials; (4) improve reading, writing and translation skills of business terminologies and documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.

Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from the Real World - CHIN-SHU 429 or BUSF-SHU 188                               The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.

Business and Finance                                                  Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from the Real World - CHIN-SHU 429 or BUSF-SHU 188                               The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201dIn addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese. Permission of Instructor required.

Managerial Skills - MGMT-SHU 21 - 3 points                               Many companies bestow a management title on key talent and expect appropriate behavior to follow. That is not the most effective way to develop future business leaders. Your expertise will take you just so far. Increasing self-awareness and being open to feedback are important first steps in leading today's business for tomorrow's results. DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT SKILLS is a course that focuses primarily on the practical aspects of managing. This course is highly interactive and, while based on solid research, it stresses a hands-on approach to improving your management skills. The focus is on developing:   Your Personal Skills: self-awareness; managing stress; solving problems &amp; creativity  What behaviors help or get in your way as you strive for personal/professional success?  How do your values influence your decisions and problem-solving approaches?  How do your learning styles help or hinder how you handle ethical dilemmas?, etc.)  Your Interpersonal Skills: coaching; counseling; supportive communication; gaining power &amp; influence; motivating self &amp; others; managing conflict  Your Group Skills: empowering &amp; delegating; building teams, leading change, running meetings.  Each session will give you an opportunity to \u201cassess\u201d, \u201canalyze\u201d, \u201cpractice\u201d, \u201clearn\u201d, \u201cteach\u201d, and \u201capply\u201d the above skills to your own work or life situation so that you can turn good ideas into effective practice. You will not only learn about management skills but you will begin to apply those skills in class, at work, at home, etc., to help you become a more effective business leader. This is not the course for you, if you prefer classes where you can sit passively by and be an &quot;academic tourist&quot;.  In the self-assessment step you assess your own skills in the topic under discussion. Usually, these will be at the beginning of each chapter. Class lectures and discussions will involve such topics as: self-awareness, creative problem-solving, communication, stress management, gaining power, motivating others, managing conflict, empowering others, giving and receiving feedback, delegating, and team building, etc...not necessarily in that order. You will analyze, write about, practice and apply these topics through case studies, group exercises, and being responsible to teach some topics to the class.   NOTE: We will NOT be reading each chapter in class. The text is YOUR resource to use as we go along as a starting point. Use it. We will seldom refer to it during class. It can serve as the basis for class discussion and reflection. However, it is not to be considered the only resource available to you. This is your opportunity to explore these topics through outside sources, including but not limited to professional and popular journals/books/organizations, Human Resources professionals, web sites, etc. Your chance to network beyond your comfort zone!  You will be required to keep a journal/log from day one. A self-awareness journal allows you to keep track of the issues that help or get in the way of your career/management goals and the action-steps you take to achieve them. This will be especially important for your final project. You will be required to hand in a one-page summary of highlights about \u00be of the way through the course.  A secondary goal is to provide you an opportunity to develop your skills in critical thinking, oral and written communication, and your ability to influence others through rational and creative approaches. Therefore, at the end of this course you will be able to:  Demonstrate your understanding and competence with respect to fundamental managerial skills: Self-awareness, stress management, creative problem solving, supportive communication, gaining power and influence, motivating others, managing conflict, building effective teams, etc.  Analyze, develop, practice, and demonstrate your ability to use these fundamental personal, interpersonal and team building skills through self-assessments, textbook learning, cases, experiential exercises, written application exercises and a final paper.                                                                      Business Analytics \u2013 BUSF-SHU 210 \u2013 4 points                               This course introduces the basic principles and techniques of applied mathematical modeling for managerial decision making. You will learn to use some important analytic methods (e.g. forecasting, data mining, optimization, Monte Carlo simulation), to recognize their assumptions and limitations, and to employ them in decision making. The course is entirely hands-on. The emphasis will be on model formulation and interpretation of results, not on mathematical theory. The emphasis is on models that are widely used in diverse industries and functional areas, including finance, marketing, and operations.

Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.

This course is divided into four chronological periods: Antiquity\u2014from the period of the \u2018central kingdoms\u2019 to the formation of the early empire; Middle Period\u2014China Among Equals; Early Modern: 1350-1910\u2014China, Global Trade, and Imperialism; Modern: 1910-present\u2014China Redux                                History                                                  China Encounters the World - HIST-SHU 312 - 4 points                               This is a lecture course on China\u2019s encounters with the world in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The course analyzes the age-old Chinese \u201cCentral Kingdom\u201d self-image and how the image was overturned during modern times in face of Western and Japanese challenges; it explores the Chinese \u201cvictim mentality\u201d and its impact on China\u2019s modern international experience; it examines China\u2019s foreign policy issues in the context of its political, economic, social and cultural developments in broader terms; it also pays special attention to the role of \u201chuman agencies\u201d in the shaping of historical processes.                                                                    The New Cold War History - HIST-SHU 325 - 4 points                               This is a reading and research seminar with an emphasis on the \u201cnew \u201cCold War history\u2014a scholarly phenomenon emerging in the 1990s, along with the end of the global Cold War and the new opportunities to conduct multiarchival and mutli-source research for scholars of international history. Students in this class will be exposed to various new interpretations, new methods of research, and new ways of thinking associated with the new Cold War history studies. Readings in this class will be focused on the scholarship that has appeared since the early and mid-1990s. Students are required to write several books reviews and a comprehensive review essay, as well as to present and critique the comprehensive review essay in class. The ultimate purpose of the course is to help students take the Cold War as a useful reference to pursue a better understanding of the challenges facing the human race in the 21st century.                                                                    The Global Space Age - HIST-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Over the course of the twentieth century the infinite void that surrounds planet Earth has stimulated the human imagination as never before. For several decades, anticipation of human spaceflight was intimately bound with futuristic visions of technoscientific progress, while space exploration became key to societal self-images. This course charts the rise and fall of the Age of Space from a global perspective. Individual sessions will be devoted to the \u2018rocket fad\u2019 of the Weimar Republic, Nazi \u2018wonder weapons\u2019, the so-called Sputnik shock and the American moon landings, as well as providing an introduction to the historical origins of techno-nationalism, from the Cold War to today\u2019s Space Race in Asia.                                                                    Moments of Europe - HIST-SHU 232 - 4 points                               This course will provide a broad introduction to the history of Europe since the French Revolution. Organized around eight exemplary \u2018moments of Europe\u2019 spanning two centuries, it will familiarize students with some of the principal themes and methods involved in the writing of Modern European History. Structured chronologically, individual sessions will be devoted to the revolutions of the early nineteenth century, processes of nationbuilding, fin-de-si\u00e8cle culture, the causes, experiences and effects of the First and Second World Wars, the transeuropean protest movements of the 1960s and 1970s, in addition to the crucial question of whether a distinctive European identity has developed over time. Materials used include political treatises, fiction, images and film.                                                                    Histories & Politics of Noise - HIST-SHU 303 - 4 points                               In this seminar, students will consider the idea that \u201cnoise\u201d has a history, and that its history dates long before the industrial revolution\u2019s ratcheting up of noise levels due to heavy machinery and the reproduction and amplification of sound through electronic technologies. Some noises pierce our ears and disrupt both our hearing and our thinking. In contrast, background noises may be loud, persistent, and even harmful to our ears, but they suffuse our everyday lives so fully that we can ignore them. Despite our daily subjective encounters with noise, can noise have a political meaning as well, one that transcends our individual experiences with din and discord, cacophony and clamor? This course explores noise\u2019s relationship to history and politics. By spending the semester reading, talking, and writing about noise, we will seek to comprehend it rather than contain it.                                                                    European Religion from the Reformation to Enlightenment - HIST-SHU 341 - 4 points                               European Christendom exploded in the sixteenth century, creating a fragmented and fractious religious landscape that still marks Europe (and Christianity worldwide) to this day. In this undergraduate lecture course, students will examine the significant changes European Christendom experienced between the Protestant and Catholic Reformations through the Enlightenment, and will explore the impact of new religious dogmas, beliefs, practices, and institutions upon the broader order of European politics, society, and culture. The readings, which consist of both primary and secondary sources, will demonstrate that the religious changes in this period shaped not only the thinking of theologians and clergymen, but also affected the everyday lives of people throughout Europe. Furthermore, the course will examine how various denominations of European Christianity participated in Europe\u2019s commercial, colonial, and imperial projects in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Students will thus also consider the interactions, both within and beyond Europe, between European Christianity and other world religions.                              Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                Interactive Media Arts                                                  Interactive Performance - INTM-SHU 171 - 4 points                               Digital content has become an important aspect of performance and the performing arts. This course will cover the challenges and possibilities of creating and incorporating interactive media in live and unpredictable environments such as the stage, a concert hall, or an outdoor venue. Programming performative interfaces and creating physical computing props will be the primary vehicles for the class. Prior programming or performing experience is not required. Communications Lab is a prerequisite but can be waived with proven experience in digital image processing. The performance discipline, being an inherently collaborative arena, places heavy emphasis on teamwork. An open mind to work with other artists, technologists and creative leaders is a must. Students are expected to present a live staged performance during the semester.  Prerequisite: Communications Lab.                                                                      Media and Participation - INTM-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.  This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.  This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.  The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.                                                                      Solar Solutions: The Sun - INTM-SHU 240 - 4 points                               Solar power is on track to be a major contributor to renewable energy systems of the future. Small scale photovoltaic cells can provide energy directly at point of use without the expense of an electricity grid and with the added benefit that the energy is free and non-polluting. This class examines how photovoltaic cells can be incorporated into interactive art, internet enabled devices and anything in between. We will look at the science behind various photovoltaic panels, calculate power requirements, and build our understanding about panel assembly and use. Among other things, students will experiment with solar circuits, BEAM robotics (Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics) and how to use photovoltaic cells with micro-controllers. Throughout the semester students will design a series of conceptual paper prototypes and physical prototypes as solutions to artistic and design challenges given throughout the course.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab                                                                      Street Food & Urban Farming - INTM-SHU 250 - 4 points                               This course introduces and makes use of digital tools (audio, video and mapping technologies) to research and record an immersive engagement with the city. It also includes a lab-based workshop in interactive media that is designed around a relevant theme. This semester the course focuses on street food &amp; urban farming.   The preservation, adaptation and disappearance of street food raise many issues that are central to contemporary Shanghai: globalization, creativity and cultural heritage, urbanization, the informal economy, and the environment. This course examines these topics by focusing on the following questions: How is Shanghai working to both integrate and exclude its migrant population? What room is there for itinerant vendors and the informal markets of the streets in the 21st century metropolis? What role does creativity play in the attempts to preserve the city\u2019s culinary heritage? How does street food contribute to the city\u2019s attempts to provide safe, affordable and nutritious food for its ever-growing population?   Adding an extra dimension to our analysis of food in the city, the course will include an intensive workshop on urban farming led by experts in the field. This will involve; an introduction to the challenges and opportunities of urban farming in China; a tour to a local urban garden, and a hands-on component aimed at building a hydroponic window farm in the IMA lab.                                                                    Expressing Data - INTM-SHU 270 - 2 points                               Human beings are producing, consuming and sharing data at any given moment. However, what kinds of data are meaningful to us? How do we capture and collect that data? What are the best ways to present it? What stories do we want to tell with data? This course will explore these questions and more. Students will learn basic techniques for data collection and filtering. Student projects can be digitial, physical, visual, musical, or (with approval) take any form imagined.  Prerequisite: Interaction Lab.                                                                      Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Communications Lab - INTM-SHU 120 - 4 points                               Communications Lab: An introductory course designed to provide students with the digital toolkit. The forms and uses of new communications technologies, including digital imaging, sound, video, animation, and basic web development, are explored in a laboratory context of hands-on experimentation, readings, and discussion. Principles of interpersonal communications, media theory, and human factors are introduced. Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                Literature                                                  World Drama: Class Conception - LIT-SHU 150 - 4 points                               This course attempts to infuse global content and employ global perspectives in studying the classics from great theatrical traditions of the world. To examine the classics from ancient Greece through Renaissance Europe to Restoration England along with those from classical China, India and Japan is to transform how they are understood; also transformed is one\u2019s understanding of drama when studying Sophocles, Kalidassa, Shakespeare, Tang Xianzu, Chikamatsu and Moli\u00e8re in the same sequence. The objective is to deepen our understanding of the diverse aesthetic principles and cultural values that continue to impact today's theatre and drama around the world.  This course is an upper level elective for NYU Shanghai Humanities majors and NYU New York English majors.                                                                      Hispanic Cities in Translation - LIT-SHU 224 - 4 points                               This course introduces twentieth century narratives of urban life from Spain and Latin America. Through artistic and cultural depictions, the urban hubs of Barcelona, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Havana and New York can be read as archaeological sites of history and memory. We will read and discuss the novels, short stories and poetry of diverse authors including Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Jorge Luis Borges, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alejo Carpentier and Octavio Paz, working with translations of their work in English. Using images, newspaper accounts, filmic and documentary representations, students will analyze and distinguish specific national, regional and linguistic contexts, while grappling with larger thematic notions of intellectual, literary, and artistic migration across national borders.

Philosophy of Science - PHIL-SHU 90 - 4 points                               This is a survey course in general philosophy of science. Our topics include: Is scientific knowledge different from other forms of knowledge? Should the history of science be seen as an ever-increasing advance of knowledge? Given that most scientific theories have turned out to be false, are we justified in believing that our current theories are true? What are scientific explanations, and what makes an explanation better than another? Do the laws of nature govern the world or simply encapsulate some interesting patterns in the world? What is the relationship between more and less fundamental scientific theories? We will examine these questions through readings drawn from both the history and philosophy of science. Prerequisites: None.                              Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Methods of Social Research - SOCS-SHU 141 - 4 points                               This is an introduction to research methods in the social sciences. It is intended to provide a foundation for an understanding of the major approaches in the social sciences to the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, and the specification and testing of theories. Special attention will be given to new methods developed to study online contents, the Internet and social media (e.g., online flow, audiences, virality and impact).  The course covers the logic of scientific inquiry and various research techniques such as experimentation, scientific sampling, survey research, field methods, archival data, and quantitative analysis that are commonly used by researchers in economics, education, political science, psychology, and sociology. The most basic goal of the class is to provide students with sufficient understanding of the basic elements of research design to be critical readers of research publications in the social sciences. In particular, they should be able to understand how the researchers arrived at their conclusions, assess whether the design of the study is adequate to support them, and possibly identify shortcomings in the design that would affect the conclusions. After completing this course students should have an overall sense of the range of methodologies for data collection and analysis available to the social science researcher, and the elements of study design required to ensure the results will actually be informative. This is not a statistics or quantitative methods class, and there will be no systematic instruction in the use of statistical software, or other quantitative analysis of data. Students seeking training in social statistics should take a course in social statistics.

Creative Writing                                                  Introduction to Creative Writing - WRIT-SHU 159 - 4 points                               This introductory course is designed for students who love to read and write creatively and who are interested in developing skills in both of these areas. We will focus mostly on fiction, with a smaller emphasis given to poetry and creative nonfiction, and we will spend the semester using these modes of creative writing to engage imaginatively and thoughtfully with the world. We will work hard in these efforts. Learning to interpret and analyze what we read is invaluable in developing our own skills as writers; assigned readings (mostly from contemporary authors) will stimulate discussions and provide models for what creative writing is and can be. Students will be expected to share their own projects in a writing workshop setting.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Great Ideas in Mathematics - MATH-SHU 10 - 4 points                               This one semester course serves as an introduction to great ideas in mathematics. During the course we will examine a variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. 1) A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? 2) Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? 3) Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa!). 4) Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. 5) Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding? Why is math a liberal art?

Prerequisite: CCSC-110.                            Social Foundations                                                  Global Cultural Heritage - CCSF-SHU 125 - 4 points                               In this course we explore the special place of &quot;cultural heritage&quot; in global life today. We will trace the journeys of cultural heritage items around the world \u2014 from the war trophies and curiosity cabinets of history, to our modern era\u2019s museums, and the global movements in antiquities, art, and other objects from the global South to collectors and museums in the global North, through looting, smuggling, and trade. Topics we\u2019ll investigate include &quot;biographical objects&quot; and the anthropology and psychology of collecting; the social life of objects of desire; the construction of value and knowledge in the representation and display of such objects; the beginnings of museums and their global spread; the concepts of national and global cultural heritage; as well as a series of ongoing international legal and moral battles over heritage, including cases related to China.                                                                    Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.
