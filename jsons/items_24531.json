About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit. Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge. Read more...          Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being. All students interested in participating in a toolkit workshop should call (212) 998-4780 for further information and registration. Read more...           Relaxation Oasis     The Relaxation Oasis is a tool to help integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the SHC promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. We emphasize a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions. Read more...          Consults for Study Abroad     Many NYU students study abroad. Health and mental health services vary from country to country. Consults are recommended to clarify counseling and medication services that might be available abroad. Read more...

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being.

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

Is medication management provided?        How does the application process work?         How long does the process take before treatment begins ?        About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit. Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge. Read more...          Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being.

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit. Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge. Read more...          Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being. All students interested in participating in a toolkit workshop should call (212) 998-4780 for further information and registration. Read more...           Relaxation Oasis     The Relaxation Oasis is a tool to help integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the SHC promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. We emphasize a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions. Read more...          Consults for Study Abroad     Many NYU students study abroad. Health and mental health services vary from country to country. Consults are recommended to clarify counseling and medication services that might be available abroad. Read more...

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit. Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge. Read more...          Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being. All students interested in participating in a toolkit workshop should call (212) 998-4780 for further information and registration. Read more...           Relaxation Oasis     The Relaxation Oasis is a tool to help integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the SHC promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. We emphasize a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions. Read more...          Consults for Study Abroad     Many NYU students study abroad. Health and mental health services vary from country to country. Consults are recommended to clarify counseling and medication services that might be available abroad. Read more...

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you.
