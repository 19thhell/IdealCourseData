Access to sophisticated technologies that are beyond the reach of individual laboratories, with relevant core facilities (including the only cGMP Vaccine and Cell Therapy Core Facility in New York City).       Support for researchers, particularly junior investigators, who conduct pilot projects with potential translational application to cancer immunology.     The Cancer Immunology Program's mission is carried out at three levels:       Basic research to investigate, at the cellular and molecular levels, the mechanisms that regulate the immune system, yielding knowledge that will further our efforts to harness the power of the immune system to treat cancer.       Translational research to develop the means to translate the findings of basic science investigations into innovative therapies, and to evaluate these therapies in vitro and in animal models.       Clinical research to design and conduct clinical trials of cancer vaccines and immunotherapies.     The Cancer Immunology Program hosts monthly meetings which provide an opportunity for investigators to exchange information and forge new collaborations.

Coursework provides students with a solid foundation in all aspects of modern cancer biology, the immune system, and the interrelationship between the two disciplines, with an emphasis on molecular, genetic, cell biological, and pathophysiological aspects of cancer and immunity, as well as translational discovery and clinical cancer biology.   Research projects in the program emphasize the study of animal models and human disease as well as molecular genetic and cell biological approaches. Laboratory research opportunities run the gamut of basic studies of cancer cell biology, such as cell cycle control, the function of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, regulation of protein degradation, maintenance of genome and chromosomal integrity, analysis of the nature and function of cancer stem cells, and regulation of gene expression and signal transduction pathways; basic studies of tumor progression over a wide range of cancer models including breast, prostate, bladder, and pancreatic cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma and leukemias; and more applied approaches to cancer and immunity, such as targeted tumor cell killing, tumor gene therapy, production of anti-tumor vaccines, and immunological and molecular approaches to cancer therapy.   The program brings together investigators from across the NYU School of Medicine, who employ cutting edge tools of molecular biology and genetics, sophisticated imaging technologies, and genomewide genetic, chemical, and proteomic analysis of cancer and immunity.
