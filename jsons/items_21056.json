Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

Advanced standing credits are college credits earned before entering NYU, either through college-level work or through examination. NYU college credit may be awarded for satisfactory work completed in a few different ways:        Satisfactory work completed at another accredited  college or university    Credit  by examination, which includes AP, IB,  and the results of some foreign  maturity examinations            HOW TO GET YOUR CREDITS POSTED: STEPS TO FOLLOW       Liberal Studies students interested in having their work reviewed for possible NYU college credit should follow the following steps.                Read below for issues to consider in having college credit posted to their student account.         Consult the bulletin of their respective, intended BA school ( CAS , Steinhardt , etc.) for information about whether or not their advanced standing credits will count toward a particular requirement (typically only in the case of science or math exams). LS students can consult this page for Advanced Standing equivalencies.         Request your AP scores from College Board and have them sent to UG Admissions .         Come to the Advising Center to fill out and submit the Request for Advanced Standing Form to have credits posted.                                           ISSUES TO CONSIDER: SHOULD YOU HAVE YOUR CREDITS POSTED AFTER ALL?       Students should consider whether or not they want to have their advanced standing credits posted, especially vis-a-vis how it may affect their eligibility for Financial Aid . Please use the following points to inform your decision on having your credits posted to your account:                CREDITS TOWARD  REQUIREMENTS: Advanced standing credits, especially those  for science or math, may count toward particular program, department, and  university requirements. Students can consult the links below for more  information about how their credits may count, but should likely consult  with the Liberal Studies Program Advising staff for information tailored  specifically to them and their program goals.                 REQUIRED COURSES  FROM WHICH ADVANCED STANDING WILL NOT EXEMPT YOU: Advanced  standing credits may not be used to exempt from the Liberal Studies core  of Writing I and II, Social Foundations I, II, and III, or Cultural  Foundations I, II, or III. In addition, advanced standing will not exempt  GLS students from their Global Cultures requirement.                 REGISTRATION DAY  AND TIME: The University's Registrar assigns the  registration days and times based on the number of earned credits,  including advanced standing credits, posted to a student's account (the  more credits, the earlier the day and time of registration within the  week). For more information about the Registrar's policy, students can  visit the Registrar's website here .                 FINANCIAL AID  IMPLICATIONS: In keeping with Federal policy on the  requirement for Satisfactory  Academic Progress , accepted credit points from  advanced standing are considered to be completed credits toward a limit of four full-time  semesters spent in Liberal Studies for two-year students before transition  and toward a limit of eight full-time semesters spent in Global Liberal Studies before  graduation. Each set of 16 credits accepted from any combination of these  sources counts as one earned semester of financial aid toward the degree.  For more information about this policy, students should consult with  representatives in NYU's Office of Financial Aid either by phone at  212-998-4444 or via email at financial.aid@nyu.edu. Students should make  sure to include their name and N number in any correspondence.                 A NOTE FOR  PREHEALTH STUDENTS: Students intending to apply to  medical, veterinary, and dental schools (or another of the pre-health  programs) should consult with Eva Bacevice ,\u00a0 the Liberal Studies Prehealth Advisor, regarding any science  or math credit they may have. More information can also be found under  &quot;Pre-health courses&quot; on the following website .               CREDIT FOR COLLEGE LEVEL COURSEWORK        Credit may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or university. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere; individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen for NYU; and the degree of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study at NYU.                Point  credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of B or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and  courses that were completed within the past 10 years.         Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of  credits transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be  transferred at face value to NYU.               To be considered for credit, students must follow the steps posted under Advanced Standing as well as send their official college transcript for review to the Liberal Studies Advising Center, 726 Broadway, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10003-2339].

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .

Advanced standing credits are college credits earned before entering NYU, either through college-level work or through examination. NYU college credit may be awarded for satisfactory work completed in a few different ways:        Satisfactory work completed at another accredited  college or university    Credit  by examination, which includes AP, IB,  and the results of some foreign  maturity examinations            HOW TO GET YOUR CREDITS POSTED: STEPS TO FOLLOW       Liberal Studies students interested in having their work reviewed for possible NYU college credit should follow the following steps.                Read below for issues to consider in having college credit posted to their student account.         Consult the bulletin of their respective, intended BA school ( CAS , Steinhardt , etc.) for information about whether or not their advanced standing credits will count toward a particular requirement (typically only in the case of science or math exams). LS students can consult this page for Advanced Standing equivalencies.         Request your AP scores from College Board and have them sent to UG Admissions .         Come to the Advising Center to fill out and submit the Request for Advanced Standing Form to have credits posted.                                           ISSUES TO CONSIDER: SHOULD YOU HAVE YOUR CREDITS POSTED AFTER ALL?       Students should consider whether or not they want to have their advanced standing credits posted, especially vis-a-vis how it may affect their eligibility for Financial Aid . Please use the following points to inform your decision on having your credits posted to your account:                CREDITS TOWARD  REQUIREMENTS: Advanced standing credits, especially those  for science or math, may count toward particular program, department, and  university requirements. Students can consult the links below for more  information about how their credits may count, but should likely consult  with the Liberal Studies Program Advising staff for information tailored  specifically to them and their program goals.                 REQUIRED COURSES  FROM WHICH ADVANCED STANDING WILL NOT EXEMPT YOU: Advanced  standing credits may not be used to exempt from the Liberal Studies core  of Writing I and II, Social Foundations I, II, and III, or Cultural  Foundations I, II, or III. In addition, advanced standing will not exempt  GLS students from their Global Cultures requirement.                 REGISTRATION DAY  AND TIME: The University's Registrar assigns the  registration days and times based on the number of earned credits,  including advanced standing credits, posted to a student's account (the  more credits, the earlier the day and time of registration within the  week). For more information about the Registrar's policy, students can  visit the Registrar's website here .                 FINANCIAL AID  IMPLICATIONS: In keeping with Federal policy on the  requirement for Satisfactory  Academic Progress , accepted credit points from  advanced standing are considered to be completed credits toward a limit of four full-time  semesters spent in Liberal Studies for two-year students before transition  and toward a limit of eight full-time semesters spent in Global Liberal Studies before  graduation. Each set of 16 credits accepted from any combination of these  sources counts as one earned semester of financial aid toward the degree.  For more information about this policy, students should consult with  representatives in NYU's Office of Financial Aid either by phone at  212-998-4444 or via email at financial.aid@nyu.edu. Students should make  sure to include their name and N number in any correspondence.                 A NOTE FOR  PREHEALTH STUDENTS: Students intending to apply to  medical, veterinary, and dental schools (or another of the pre-health  programs) should consult with Eva Bacevice ,\u00a0 the Liberal Studies Prehealth Advisor, regarding any science  or math credit they may have. More information can also be found under  &quot;Pre-health courses&quot; on the following website .               CREDIT FOR COLLEGE LEVEL COURSEWORK        Credit may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or university. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere; individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen for NYU; and the degree of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study at NYU.                Point  credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of B or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and  courses that were completed within the past 10 years.         Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of  credits transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be  transferred at face value to NYU.               To be considered for credit, students must follow the steps posted under Advanced Standing as well as send their official college transcript for review to the Liberal Studies Advising Center, 726 Broadway, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10003-2339].
