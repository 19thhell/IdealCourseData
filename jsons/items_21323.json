Carter Journalism Institute has established the Matthew Power Literary Reporting Award, which will provide $12,500 every year to a young journalist researching an important story that illuminates the human condition.   The award was created in collaboration with relatives, friends, and organizations touched by journalist Matthew Power, who died while on assignment in Uganda in the spring of 2014. It will provide the financial support needed by non-fiction writers to travel and cover a wide range of stories that will continue Power\u2019s quest to seek out these narratives.   \u201cMatthew Power\u2019s singular set of skills allowed him to travel the globe, giving underreported stories the attention they deserve,\u201d said Professor Ted Conover, a friend of Power\u2019s who will coordinate administration of the award at the Carter Institute. \u201cYoung writers still building a reputation can\u2019t always wrangle the financial commitments to do this kind of work. The award will perpetuate Matt\u2019s legacy by allowing one a year to do so.\u201d   The proposal deadline for the award is February 16, 2015, with a decision anticipated around mid-April. The Matthew Power Literary Reporting Award Committee, a panel of NYU journalism professors, outside writers, and editors, will review the applications and select a recipient. Recipients of the award will complete their projects by November 4, 2015. Judges will be looking for applicants with strong storytelling abilities and a commitment to those he/she is writing about, said Conover.   Power was an established freelance writer who contributed to such publications as GQ, Harper\u2019s Magazine, Men\u2019s Journal, National Geographic Adventure, and The New York Times. He also worked in broadcast journalism. Power was a three-time finalist for the Livingston Award for Young Journalists in international reporting. His work was frequently featured in annual anthologies such as Best American Travel Writing and Best American Spiritual Writing. Power died on March 10, 2014, while accompanying the explorer Levison Wood, who was trying to become the first person to walk the entire length of the Nile River. Wood completed the journey in August 2014.   Ineligible to apply are NYU affiliates, NYU graduates with degrees dated 2013 and after, and journalists holding staff positions at established media outlets that are in a position to fund such projects on their own. The award will not fund proposals to report on armed conflicts where journalists are already imperiled or projects that are mainly investigatory.

Offered for the first time in 2015, the Award has been endowed by individuals and organizations touched by the life and work of Matthew Power, a wide-roving and award-winning journalist who sought to live and share the experience of the individuals and places on which he was reporting. Power, a longtime friend of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, died in March 2014, while on assignment in Uganda.   The award proceeds from the recognition that many important stories need to be reported from afar, and that publications do not always have the resources to send a writer where the story is. The money need not be used exclusively for travel, but we expect that most successful applications will include such expenses.   A panel of NYU journalism professors, outside writers, and editors will review the proposals. Finalists may be asked to interview in person or by Skype.   The judges will be interested in perpetuating Power's legacy, as his former editor Roger Hodge put it, of \u201cstrong, character-driven narratives with detailed scene writing and lyrical description.\u201d Power was always open to the absurdity that often attends politics and international affairs; he was always searching, as he put it, for \u201cthe human truth beneath the sorry facts.\u201d Power's ultimate ambition, he added, was literary beauty.   That said, judges will be looking for a writer as singular in his or her own approach as Power was in his.   The award will not fund proposals to report on armed conflicts where journalists are already imperiled, nor projects that are mainly investigatory. Winners will receive visiting scholar privileges at NYU, granting them library access and, staffing and space permitting, an office.
