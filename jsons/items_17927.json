NYU's New York campus is centered in two locations: the heart of New York City's famed Greenwich Village, and the School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn, one of the fastest growing hubs of science and technology in the nation.            Transportation &amp; Parking     The NYU Welcome Center is easily accessible by public transportation. The New York City subway's A, B, C, D, E, F, and M lines stop at West 4th Street station, and the N and R subway lines stop at 8th Street - NYU station, which are closest to the campus center and Washington Square Park. Also close by is the Astor Place Station, served by the 6 line.   Our Brooklyn location is served by the A, C, F, and R lines at Jay Street-MetroTech station.     Transport resources:     Amtrak   Metropolitan Transportation Authority (subway, bus, Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Rail Road)   NJ Transit (commuter rail)     New York City is served by several area airports, with John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty being the closest to campus. Airport connections are available by car service, taxi, and public transport. NYU Admissions discounts are available for select car services.   Air transport resources:     Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (operator of JFK, LGA, and EWR airports)       For guests joining us in Greenwich Village by car, there are many parking garages nearby, some of which offer discounted parking for NYU guests.
