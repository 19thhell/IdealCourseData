As the mental health needs of college students increase, both in the number of students seeking services and the severity of the pathology, 2 it is imperative that NYU continue to develop innovative approaches to engage students in necessary treatments.             Key Facts     Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds. 3   22.5% of NYU students reported that anxiety had impacted their academic performance in the past 12 months. 4   55% of NYU students reported that emotional or mental difficulties had hurt their academic performance for one or more days in the past month. 5   59% of NYU students demonstrating symptoms of depression reported that problems resulting from these symptoms had made it difficult forthem to do their schoolwork, take care of things at home, or get along with other people. 5   17.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing serious psychological distress in 2007. 5   8.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing a major depressive episode within the past year. 7   90% of college or university counseling center directors in the United States report an increase in psychological problems among their students. 7   The proportion of students, nationally, with a previous diagnosis of depression increased from 10% to 15% between 2000 and 2005. 8   75% of lifetime mental disorders have first onset by the typical college age range of 18-24. 9                                           Recommendations     Develop mental health outreach targeted to specific at-risk student groups to increase utilization of treatment.  Students from different backgrounds may experience greater levels of stigma toward mental health issues. For example, studies have shown that Asian international students - compared with American students - experience greater discomfort or shame with counseling, less openness to counseling, and a greater preference for a flexible counseling format. 10 Young adults who perceive public stigma surrounding mental illness are less likely to perceive a need to seek help. 11 This perception of stigma can contribute to underutilization of university mental health services, while concerns regarding language and culture can act as barriers to counseling. 10 New models advocate for a culturally sensitive continuity of care which tailors mental health outreach and services to diverse groups of people. 12 Ensuring that NYU\u2019s counseling services are culturally competent to accommodate the needs of a diverse student population is a necessity.       Raise student awareness of the impact of anxiety and depression on their ability to learn, function, and succeed.  Depression is a significant predictor of not only GPA but also the likelihood of withdrawing from the university. 1 Untreated depression is associated with a decrease ofa 0.49 point, or half a letter grade, in a student\u2019s grade point average. 13 In contrast, treatment for depression is correlated with a protective effect of 0.44 points. 13 Students who report greater psychological distress also tend to view themselves as less capable of succeeding, are more anxious about their class performance, 14 and possess lower self-efficacy and resource management skills. 13 With increased knowledge of the impact of mental health issues on their academic performance and college experience, students may be more likely to seek help or support.       Educate university staff and faculty about the impact of anxiety and depression on learning outcomes, ability to function, and student success.   By virtue of their interactions with students, university staff and faculty are uniquely positioned to have a positive impact on their students\u2019 mental health. Research has shown that when faculty and students are trained to recognize symptoms of depression, students may increase treatment-seeking behaviors. 15 Studies have emphasized the importance of training faculty and staff to understand the relationship between mental health and learning. 16 Additionally, graduate students who have functional relationships with their advisors are less prone to report emotional or stress-related problems. 17 Creating a university-wide culture and environment that encourages inclusiveness and support to augment campus mental health services has been recommended to improve outcomes for students. 16       Expand the development and utilization of holistic therapeutic interventions.  Evidence-based holistic interventions, such as biofeedback, art therapy, and music therapy have been shown to supplement traditional mental health treatments. Participation in the arts can benefit those with mental health difficulties, particularly increasing feelings of empowerment 18 and coping abilities. 19 Students using biofeedback in combination with relaxation techniques reported significantly lower anxiety and less mental and physical manifestations of stress than did those using relaxation techniques alone. 20 Music, as used by music therapists, has the potential to ameliorate the mental health of those with a variety of psychiatric conditions. 21 The expansion of holistic therapeutic intervention offerings may be particularly effective for students with emotional adjustment problems and serve to augment treatment for students with a mental health diagnosis.       Improve the coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community.  Fragmentation of the behavioral health service delivery system is noted as a significant obstacle to the receipt of quality mental health care. 22,23 Monitoring treatment compliance and efficacy among students diagnosed with depression using a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach among NYU primary care and counseling services as well as case management has been shown to ensure that students with mental health needs receive optimal treatment. 24 NYU students in need of long-term counseling are referred from Counseling and Wellness Services to high-quality clinicians in the community. Enhancing partnerships and improving coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community ensures that more students will receive effective and necessary mental health care.       Strengthen connections between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and student-run mental health interest groups and initiatives.   Student-run mental health initiatives, such as advocacy groups or peer-led education and support, are important components of suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Operating in conjunction with treatment, student mental health interest groups contribute to an atmosphere of inclusion and empowerment for mentally ill students. 25 Research suggests that when students become involved with student-run campus mental health awareness and/or advocacy groups, such as Active Minds, their attitudes of stigma toward mental illness decrease. 25 Furthermore, interpersonal contact between those with mental illness and those without is an effective strategy in reducing stigmatizing views of people with mental health issues. 25                                                           Indicator Technical Notes                               a) Engagement in mental health treatment among students who have seriously considered suicide     Data Source: ACHA #30J &amp; #31A1-31B7   Survey Questions: Have you ever seriously considered suicide? &amp; Within the last 12 months have you been diagnosed or treated by a professional for any of the following: anorexia; anxiety; ADHA; bipolar disorder; bulimia; depression; insomnia; other sleep disorder; OCD; panic attacks; phobia; schizophrenia; substance abuse or addiction; other addiction; other mental health condition?

Depression is a significant predictor of not only GPA but also the likelihood of withdrawing from the university. 1 Untreated depression is associated with a decrease ofa 0.49 point, or half a letter grade, in a student\u2019s grade point average. 13 In contrast, treatment for depression is correlated with a protective effect of 0.44 points. 13 Students who report greater psychological distress also tend to view themselves as less capable of succeeding, are more anxious about their class performance, 14 and possess lower self-efficacy and resource management skills. 13 With increased knowledge of the impact of mental health issues on their academic performance and college experience, students may be more likely to seek help or support.       Educate university staff and faculty about the impact of anxiety and depression on learning outcomes, ability to function, and student success.   By virtue of their interactions with students, university staff and faculty are uniquely positioned to have a positive impact on their students\u2019 mental health. Research has shown that when faculty and students are trained to recognize symptoms of depression, students may increase treatment-seeking behaviors. 15 Studies have emphasized the importance of training faculty and staff to understand the relationship between mental health and learning. 16 Additionally, graduate students who have functional relationships with their advisors are less prone to report emotional or stress-related problems. 17 Creating a university-wide culture and environment that encourages inclusiveness and support to augment campus mental health services has been recommended to improve outcomes for students. 16       Expand the development and utilization of holistic therapeutic interventions.  Evidence-based holistic interventions, such as biofeedback, art therapy, and music therapy have been shown to supplement traditional mental health treatments. Participation in the arts can benefit those with mental health difficulties, particularly increasing feelings of empowerment 18 and coping abilities. 19 Students using biofeedback in combination with relaxation techniques reported significantly lower anxiety and less mental and physical manifestations of stress than did those using relaxation techniques alone. 20 Music, as used by music therapists, has the potential to ameliorate the mental health of those with a variety of psychiatric conditions. 21 The expansion of holistic therapeutic intervention offerings may be particularly effective for students with emotional adjustment problems and serve to augment treatment for students with a mental health diagnosis.       Improve the coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community.  Fragmentation of the behavioral health service delivery system is noted as a significant obstacle to the receipt of quality mental health care. 22,23 Monitoring treatment compliance and efficacy among students diagnosed with depression using a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach among NYU primary care and counseling services as well as case management has been shown to ensure that students with mental health needs receive optimal treatment. 24 NYU students in need of long-term counseling are referred from Counseling and Wellness Services to high-quality clinicians in the community. Enhancing partnerships and improving coordination between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and treatment providers in the community ensures that more students will receive effective and necessary mental health care.       Strengthen connections between NYU Counseling and Wellness Services and student-run mental health interest groups and initiatives.   Student-run mental health initiatives, such as advocacy groups or peer-led education and support, are important components of suicide prevention and mental health promotion. Operating in conjunction with treatment, student mental health interest groups contribute to an atmosphere of inclusion and empowerment for mentally ill students. 25 Research suggests that when students become involved with student-run campus mental health awareness and/or advocacy groups, such as Active Minds, their attitudes of stigma toward mental illness decrease. 25 Furthermore, interpersonal contact between those with mental illness and those without is an effective strategy in reducing stigmatizing views of people with mental health issues. 25                                                           Indicator Technical Notes                               a) Engagement in mental health treatment among students who have seriously considered suicide     Data Source: ACHA #30J &amp; #31A1-31B7   Survey Questions: Have you ever seriously considered suicide? &amp; Within the last 12 months have you been diagnosed or treated by a professional for any of the following: anorexia; anxiety; ADHA; bipolar disorder; bulimia; depression; insomnia; other sleep disorder; OCD; panic attacks; phobia; schizophrenia; substance abuse or addiction; other addiction; other mental health condition?

As the mental health needs of college students increase, both in the number of students seeking services and the severity of the pathology, 2 it is imperative that NYU continue to develop innovative approaches to engage students in necessary treatments.             Key Facts     Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds. 3   22.5% of NYU students reported that anxiety had impacted their academic performance in the past 12 months. 4   55% of NYU students reported that emotional or mental difficulties had hurt their academic performance for one or more days in the past month. 5   59% of NYU students demonstrating symptoms of depression reported that problems resulting from these symptoms had made it difficult forthem to do their schoolwork, take care of things at home, or get along with other people. 5   17.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing serious psychological distress in 2007. 5   8.9% of adults between the ages of 18 and 25 reported experiencing a major depressive episode within the past year. 7   90% of college or university counseling center directors in the United States report an increase in psychological problems among their students. 7   The proportion of students, nationally, with a previous diagnosis of depression increased from 10% to 15% between 2000 and 2005. 8   75% of lifetime mental disorders have first onset by the typical college age range of 18-24. 9                                           Recommendations     Develop mental health outreach targeted to specific at-risk student groups to increase utilization of treatment.  Students from different backgrounds may experience greater levels of stigma toward mental health issues. For example, studies have shown that Asian international students - compared with American students - experience greater discomfort or shame with counseling, less openness to counseling, and a greater preference for a flexible counseling format. 10 Young adults who perceive public stigma surrounding mental illness are less likely to perceive a need to seek help. 11 This perception of stigma can contribute to underutilization of university mental health services, while concerns regarding language and culture can act as barriers to counseling. 10 New models advocate for a culturally sensitive continuity of care which tailors mental health outreach and services to diverse groups of people. 12 Ensuring that NYU\u2019s counseling services are culturally competent to accommodate the needs of a diverse student population is a necessity.       Raise student awareness of the impact of anxiety and depression on their ability to learn, function, and succeed.  Depression is a significant predictor of not only GPA but also the likelihood of withdrawing from the university. 1 Untreated depression is associated with a decrease ofa 0.49 point, or half a letter grade, in a student\u2019s grade point average. 13 In contrast, treatment for depression is correlated with a protective effect of 0.44 points. 13 Students who report greater psychological distress also tend to view themselves as less capable of succeeding, are more anxious about their class performance, 14 and possess lower self-efficacy and resource management skills. 13 With increased knowledge of the impact of mental health issues on their academic performance and college experience, students may be more likely to seek help or support.

Its philosophical roots can be found in the school of behaviorism which states that psychological matters can be studied scientifically by observing overt behavior, without discussing internal mental states. Classical conditioning (often associated with the work of Pavlov) is another important feature of behavior therapy. As a result of experience, or associative learning, individuals often respond in predictable ways to certain stimuli or life events which may no longer be appropriate. These techniques follow from the premise that maladaptive behaviors are learned, and therefore can be unlearned as well. Among the behavioral techniques employed are training in both assertiveness and relaxation, and gradual desensitization to feared objects.      Return To Top      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy(CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach comprised of both cognitive and behavioral techniques. The premise underlying a cognitive-behavioral orientation is that difficulties in living, relationships, general health, etc., have their origin in (and are maintained by) both cognitive and behavioral factors. CBT aims to influence problematic and dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and cognitions through a goal-oriented, systematic procedure. CBT is often brief and time-limited and is used in individual therapy as well as group settings.      Return To Top      Cognitive Therapy essentially involves helping an individual think in more effective ways and aims to uncover the irrational and problematic thinking styles that often accompany psychological distress. The goal of cognitive intervention is to challenge, and ultimately change, maladaptive, self-defeating cognitions, and allow the client to lead a more productive and satisfying life. Simple to learn cognitive strategies provide clients with practical and powerful skills that can be applied over a lifetime as effective tools in life-management.      Return To Top      Group Psychotherapy or group therapy is a form of psychotherapy which one or more therapists treat a small group of clients together as a group. In group psychotherapy the group context and group process is explicitly utilized as a mechanism of change by developing, exploring and examining interpersonal relationships within the group.      Return To Top      Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) , also known as electroshock , is most often used as a treatment for severe major depression which has not responded to other treatment, and is also used in the treatment of mania, catatonia, schizophrenia and other disorders. Treatment can be either on an inpatient or outpatient basis and usually in a course of 6-12 treatments administered 2 or 3 times a week. After treatment, drug therapy can be continued, and some patients receive continuation/maintenance ECT. Certain types of ECT have been shown to cause persistent memory loss, whereas confusion usually clears within hours of treatment.      Return To Top      Individual Psychotherapy see Psychotherapy      Inpatient Services is the care of patients whose condition requires hospitalization. Progress in modern medicine and the advent of comprehensive out patient programs ensure that patients are only admitted to a hospital when they are extremely ill.      Return To Top      Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) offers psychiatric evaluation and psychotherapeutic treatment enhanced by techniques derived from a psychotherapy model developed by Habib Davanloo, MD. ISTDP's primary goal is to help the patient overcome internal resistance to experiencing true feelings about the present and past which have been warded off because they are either too frightening or too painful. The technique is intensive in that it aims to help the patient experience these warded-off feelings to the maximum degree possible; it is short-term in that it tries to achieve this experience as quickly as possible; it is dynamic because it involves working with unconscious forces and transference feelings.      Return To Top      Pharmacotherapy is the treatment of mental illness or mental disorders with medication. This type of treatment can be combined with psychotherapy and can also stand alone.      Return To Top      Psychiatric Evaluation is an examination or assessment of the mental health of an individual and is the mental equivalent of a physical examination. A psychological evaluation may result in a diagnosis of a mental illness or disorder.      Return To Top      Psychoanalytic Treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of underlying sources of his or her difficulties, not just intellectually, but emotionally by re-experiencing them with the analyst, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the patient\u2019s life.      Return To Top      Psychotherapy or Individual Psychotherapy is an interpersonal relational intervention used by psychotherapists to help individuals, couples, families or groups in problems of living. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, dialogue, communication and behavior change that are designed to improve the mental health of the individual or to improve group relationships. Psychotherapy may be performed by practitioners with a number of different qualifications, including psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, psychiatric nurses, music therapists and creative arts therapists.Typically, the patient comes four or five times a week, lies on a couch, and attempts to say everything that comes to mind.
