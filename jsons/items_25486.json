Students who secure an internship through or with the assistance of NYU Washington, DC must confirm their spot in the program and enroll in the internship class in order to accept the internship.

Always consult with your academic adviser to confirm how the internship course and other courses you will take while away fit in with your academic progress towards degree fulfillment. Students are required to pursue a minimum of 10 hours/week in their internships to earn course credit. NYU Washington, DC advises that students pursue no more than 20 hrs/week in internship commitments.

Students are highly encouraged to consult NYU Washington DC staff for assistance with these decisions.

General Information for Studio Art, Costume Studies and Visual Arts Administration Students    Internships in Art is a variable credit course, with required hours per credit, for which a grade is administered. Internships are suited to a student&rsquo;s interests and needs and provide a vital link to the New York art world while helping students focus her or his career goals.

Do not start an internship without the prior approval of the Internships and Grants Administrator before the drop/add deadline of the semester in which you are interning or it will not count toward your degree.    Finding Internship Positions Ideally an internship is suited to your interests and needs and will provide many wonderful connections while helping you narrow down your goals for a career. Here are some things to help you think about your future internships:       Large organizations such as museums or established non-profits have internship criteria and information on their websites. If you are interested in interning at MoMA, for example, plan at least a semester ahead of time. If you are interested in a smaller non-profit like Artists Space, you should still look at their website for information. Always check any organization&rsquo;s website for the current deadlines and contact information. Larger organizations and companies such as Viacom will handle internships through their Human Resources Department.          Galleries are the exception to this rule as they do not list any of this information on their websites and do not work as far in advance as a museum or large company might. To secure a gallery internship it is recommended that you think about what type of artwork or gallery you are interested in, what part of the city you want to be in and the Internships and Grants Administrator can help you navigate the choices. You can always contact a gallery to request an internship. Most are eager to sponsor an intern but not always proactive about soliciting applications. See the Resources listing below.       Applying for an Internship Position Feel free to meet with the Internship Coordinator for feedback on your cover letter and resume before applying to an internship as well as to prepare for an interview. You may set up an Internships in Art appointment by emailing lav1@nyu.edu .    Business Cards for Students Did you know that undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in NYU Steinhardt may order (for a fee) business cards printed with the School logo, student email address/phone number, graduation month/year, etc.? The cards are useful in job searches, in informational interviews, and at informal gatherings.    Other Practical Considerations:       If sponsors require a letter verifying that you are registered for the course Internships in Art and will receive credit, please contact the Internships and Grants Administrator.          Apply for the NYU Wasserman Funded Internship Award offered every semester. The purpose of this $1,000 award is to provide financial assistance to students pursuing unpaid internships in the arts, education, public service and other not-for-profits. The deadlines and guidelines for applying are found on the Wasserman website .          International students must apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) via the NYU Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) to receive work authorization and especially to receive any form of payment including hourly wage, travel reimbursement, stipend, etc.       Resources Majors in Studio Art, Costume Studies, and Visual Arts Administration receive weekly emails through the Department listserv with current Internships and Jobs in the Arts. These are people that have contacted us and these tend to be for the immediate future. These emails will provide some wonderful opportunities but by no means are they the only way to find an internship. Use your imagination and meet with the Internships and Grants Administrator for ideas. Also visit the selected listing of internship sponsors on our website.    You can find many helpful websites that list available internships on our Employment Resources website .

General Information for Studio Art, Costume Studies and Visual Arts Administration Students    Internships in Art is a variable credit course, with required hours per credit, for which a grade is administered. Internships are suited to a student&rsquo;s interests and needs and provide a vital link to the New York art world while helping students focus her or his career goals.    Coursework for Internships in Art includes an extensive journal of your internship experience, a research paper on the organization, a summation paper and regular meetings with the Internships and Grants Administrator.

Do not start an internship without the prior approval of the Internships and Grants Administrator before the drop/add deadline of the semester in which you are interning or it will not count toward your degree.    Finding Internship Positions Ideally an internship is suited to your interests and needs and will provide many wonderful connections while helping you narrow down your goals for a career. Here are some things to help you think about your future internships:       Large organizations such as museums or established non-profits have internship criteria and information on their websites. If you are interested in interning at MoMA, for example, plan at least a semester ahead of time. If you are interested in a smaller non-profit like Artists Space, you should still look at their website for information. Always check any organization&rsquo;s website for the current deadlines and contact information. Larger organizations and companies such as Viacom will handle internships through their Human Resources Department.          Galleries are the exception to this rule as they do not list any of this information on their websites and do not work as far in advance as a museum or large company might. To secure a gallery internship it is recommended that you think about what type of artwork or gallery you are interested in, what part of the city you want to be in and the Internships and Grants Administrator can help you navigate the choices. You can always contact a gallery to request an internship. Most are eager to sponsor an intern but not always proactive about soliciting applications. See the Resources listing below.       Applying for an Internship Position Feel free to meet with the Internship Coordinator for feedback on your cover letter and resume before applying to an internship as well as to prepare for an interview. You may set up an Internships in Art appointment by emailing lav1@nyu.edu .    Business Cards for Students Did you know that undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in NYU Steinhardt may order (for a fee) business cards printed with the School logo, student email address/phone number, graduation month/year, etc.? The cards are useful in job searches, in informational interviews, and at informal gatherings.    Other Practical Considerations:       If sponsors require a letter verifying that you are registered for the course Internships in Art and will receive credit, please contact the Internships and Grants Administrator.          Apply for the NYU Wasserman Funded Internship Award offered every semester. The purpose of this $1,000 award is to provide financial assistance to students pursuing unpaid internships in the arts, education, public service and other not-for-profits. The deadlines and guidelines for applying are found on the Wasserman website .          International students must apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) via the NYU Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) to receive work authorization and especially to receive any form of payment including hourly wage, travel reimbursement, stipend, etc.       Resources Majors in Studio Art, Costume Studies, and Visual Arts Administration receive weekly emails through the Department listserv with current Internships and Jobs in the Arts. These are people that have contacted us and these tend to be for the immediate future. These emails will provide some wonderful opportunities but by no means are they the only way to find an internship. Use your imagination and meet with the Internships and Grants Administrator for ideas. Also visit the selected listing of internship sponsors on our website.    You can find many helpful websites that list available internships on our Employment Resources website .

General Information for Studio Art, Costume Studies and Visual Arts Administration Students    Internships in Art is a variable credit course, with required hours per credit, for which a grade is administered. Internships are suited to a student&rsquo;s interests and needs and provide a vital link to the New York art world while helping students focus her or his career goals.    Coursework for Internships in Art includes an extensive journal of your internship experience, a research paper on the organization, a summation paper and regular meetings with the Internships and Grants Administrator.

Do not start an internship without the prior approval of the Internships and Grants Administrator before the drop/add deadline of the semester in which you are interning or it will not count toward your degree.    Finding Internship Positions Ideally an internship is suited to your interests and needs and will provide many wonderful connections while helping you narrow down your goals for a career. Here are some things to help you think about your future internships:       Large organizations such as museums or established non-profits have internship criteria and information on their websites. If you are interested in interning at MoMA, for example, plan at least a semester ahead of time. If you are interested in a smaller non-profit like Artists Space, you should still look at their website for information. Always check any organization&rsquo;s website for the current deadlines and contact information. Larger organizations and companies such as Viacom will handle internships through their Human Resources Department.          Galleries are the exception to this rule as they do not list any of this information on their websites and do not work as far in advance as a museum or large company might. To secure a gallery internship it is recommended that you think about what type of artwork or gallery you are interested in, what part of the city you want to be in and the Internships and Grants Administrator can help you navigate the choices. You can always contact a gallery to request an internship. Most are eager to sponsor an intern but not always proactive about soliciting applications. See the Resources listing below.       Applying for an Internship Position Feel free to meet with the Internship Coordinator for feedback on your cover letter and resume before applying to an internship as well as to prepare for an interview. You may set up an Internships in Art appointment by emailing lav1@nyu.edu .    Business Cards for Students Did you know that undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in NYU Steinhardt may order (for a fee) business cards printed with the School logo, student email address/phone number, graduation month/year, etc.? The cards are useful in job searches, in informational interviews, and at informal gatherings.    Other Practical Considerations:       If sponsors require a letter verifying that you are registered for the course Internships in Art and will receive credit, please contact the Internships and Grants Administrator.          Apply for the NYU Wasserman Funded Internship Award offered every semester. The purpose of this $1,000 award is to provide financial assistance to students pursuing unpaid internships in the arts, education, public service and other not-for-profits. The deadlines and guidelines for applying are found on the Wasserman website .          International students must apply for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) via the NYU Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) to receive work authorization and especially to receive any form of payment including hourly wage, travel reimbursement, stipend, etc.       Resources Majors in Studio Art, Costume Studies, and Visual Arts Administration receive weekly emails through the Department listserv with current Internships and Jobs in the Arts. These are people that have contacted us and these tend to be for the immediate future. These emails will provide some wonderful opportunities but by no means are they the only way to find an internship. Use your imagination and meet with the Internships and Grants Administrator for ideas. Also visit the selected listing of internship sponsors on our website.
