The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.

In a multi-site study led by principal investigator Orrin Devinsky, MD , researchers saw over a 50 percent reduction in frequency of certain types of seizures in some patients taking the cannabidiol. The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s 67th Annual Meeting.

And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.

The research published online in the journal Nature could lead to a better understanding of how oxytocin and other hormones can treat behavioral problems resulting from disease or trauma to the brain. \u201cOur findings redefine oxytocin as something completely different from a \u2018love drug,\u2019 but more as an amplifier and suppressor of neural signals in the brain,\u201d explains study senior investigator Robert Froemke, PhD .

In a multi-site study led by principal investigator Orrin Devinsky, MD , researchers saw over a 50 percent reduction in frequency of certain types of seizures in some patients taking the cannabidiol. The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s 67th Annual Meeting.

MCC-GE 2027-001 Media and the Environment Nicholas Mirzoeff Mondays 11:00 AM &ndash; 1:10 PM| 4 credits MA Area of Study: Visual Culture and Cultural Studies &amp; Technology and Society This seminar takes on the twin related questions: How can we see and visualize the Anthropocene? And how can we imagine a climate justice movement to respond to it? The Anthropocene challenges our concepts of time, scale, and agency, requiring nothing less than a new history of the modern. Climate justice demands not just a reduction in emissions but an acknowledgement that climate change has most affected those already most without resource. How do we shape approaches to the Anthropocene that identify settler colonialism and industrial capitalism as the key causes, rather than humans as a whole? How do we highlight the gendered and raced ways of thinking about climate and environment? Our methods will center on mapping, archiving and activism.    MCC-GE 2112-001 Politics of the Gaze Allen Feldman Mondays 4:55 PM - 7:05 PM | 4 credits MA Area of Study: Visual Culture and Cultural Studies The meditation and technological development of vision and its dominance over the human sensorium is integral to the emergence of the modern, including experiences of urbanism, consumer desire, gender/sexual identities, race and ethnicity, trans-cultural image systems, aesthetic production, and the making of power and political truth claims. This seminar will focus on introducing participants to the core theories and analytic methods of visual culture, and the socio-political history of the human sensorium in a variety of disciplines, including ethnography, social history, urban studies, cinema studies, social geography, material culture studies, and media studies.    MCC-GE 2130-001 Topics in Digital Media: Privacy Helen Nissenbaum Thursdays 2:00 PM &ndash; 4:10 PM | 4 credits MA Area of Study: Technology and Society Information technology and digital media, often associated with threats to privacy, are increasingly called upon to protect, preserve, and enhance it. This graduate-level, project-based course observes both sides of the story through a multidisciplinary lens. It examines topical policy issues as well as controversial systems and technologies that both threaten privacy, and are called in service of its protection. Course modules may include Web tracking, biometric Identification, big data, quantified self, Internet of things, and social networks. For each of these, it will survey underlying technologies and related ethical, legal, and policy issues. Ideally, the course will attract students with diverse backgrounds, some in technical fields others in the social sciences and humanities, who will collaborate on term projects.

At the same time, the issue of global Internet governance raises challenging questions, including: where the control of the Internet should reside, what guiding principles should be used &amp; who should take part in the policy making process? Students will explore prominent narratives &amp; issues, such as the concept of architectural openness &amp; the promotion of Internet Freedom. Through weekly discussions &amp; the tracking of developmental shifts, this course seeks to provide insight into the possible future of the medium.    MCC-GE 2380-001 Topics in Globalization Arjun Appadurai Wednesdays 2:00 PM - 4:10 PM | 4 credits MA Areas of Study: Global and Transcultural Communication, Visual Culture and Cultural Studies TOPIC: CULTURAL DIMENSIONS OF GLOBALIZATION: Almost twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, our understanding of how globalization has affected the circulation of global images, forms and ideologies has changed considerably. This course will focus on new forms of commodity circulation and consumption, on new sites of ethnic and religious violence, on new debates over privacy and free expression, and on new forms of diasporic politics. The primary aim of the course will be to expose students to the major debates in these areas and to develop analytic tools for understanding the role of mediation in new formations of identity, aspiration and consumption.    MCC-GE 2900-001 Thesis in Media, Culture, and Communication Radha Hegde Mondays 4:55 &ndash; 7:05 PM | 4 credits The thesis project synthesized general knowledge in the field of media, culture and communication as well as demonstrates a high level of competency in the candidate's chosen area of study in accordance with institutional and state regulations.

MCC-GE 3130-001 Special Topics: Global and Transcultural Communication Arjun Appadurai Mondays 2:00 &ndash; 4:50 PM | 4 credits DOCTORAL Students Only\u2028 TOPIC: Mediation and Materialization. This doctoral seminar will focus on ways in which the growing literature on the relationships between humans, spirits and other animated objects are producing new forms of agency, sociality and connectivity. Readings will focus on mainly on the work of anthropologists on new ways of looking at comparative social ontologies and cosmologies - including the work of Philippe Descola, Viveiros de Castro, Tim Ingold, Nurit Bird and Marilyn Strathern. These anthropological approaches will be supplemented by selected writings of Arjun Appadurai, Bruno Latour, W.J.T. Mitchell,Jane Bennett and other theorists, to ask how new forms of material assemblage affect existing theories of society, cosmos and mediation. The goal of the class will be to ask whether an expanded vision of in-dividuality demands a different understanding of mediation, culture and communication.    MCC-GE 3150-001 Special Topics in Technology Studies Natasha Schull Mondays 11:00 AM &ndash; 1:50 PM | 4 credits DOCTORAL Students Only\u2028 TOPIC: Self as Data. The past decade has seen a great deal of public discussion and debate over the ways that governments and corporations collect data on citizens and consumers, and the ends to which they use it. This seminar takes a different approach, focusing on cases in which individuals treat their own habits, bodies, moods, and thoughts as objects of scrutiny, analysis, and intervention. Ranging from 19th-century diary writing to contemporary diet techniques, Benjamin Franklin&rsquo;s self-&shy;monitoring practices to the Quantified Self movement&rsquo;s digital data collection apps, the course explores what different modes of self-examination, self-&shy;analysis, and self-&shy;governance might reveal about changing cultural values, political contexts, and understandings of the self, and how they remake subjectivity.
