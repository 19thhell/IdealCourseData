The focus is on understanding interrelations between music businesses and consumer technologies, audio for games and other interactive applications, sound design in the digital music space, and emerging platforms for the generation and exploitation of music. Applicants for this concentration submit details of their prior academic and/or professional music and business technology experience. In their final MA projects, students in the Concentration have developed mobile apps, started businesses, proposed business and technology policies and strategies to government agencies, used technology to promote emerging music trends abroad, and built new IP (intellectual property) assets for start-up firms using recorded music samples.    The Music Business Graduate Program is a specialized graduate degree that addresses the music industry as a unique business operating within corporate and entrepreneurial structures. The skills you develop will serve you well in a fast-paced industry that needs thoroughly trained personnel who can apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension. Business courses are offered through NYU's Leonard N. Stern School of Business.
