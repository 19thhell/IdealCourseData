Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the NYU school or college after a student is admitted. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not evaluate courses for possible transfer credit before a student is admitted to NYU. Freshmen are generally awarded a maximum of 32 credits upon arrival at NYU and transfer students are generally awarded a maximum of 64 credits upon arrival at NYU. Transfer students must typically take a minimum of 64 credits at NYU to obtain a bachelor's degree from NYU.          AP Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the College Board to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (NYU's code is 2562).     IB Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the International Baccalaureate Organization to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.     College/University Course Credit   Credits Earned While In High School   Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better in the courses and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. Generally, these courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.     NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.   Credits Earned After High School   Students may be eligible for transfer credit in courses taken for credit at an accredited college within the last ten years, provided the student earned a minimum grade of &quot;C.&quot; Upon receiving an offer of admission, students will receive a detailed evaluation of transfer credit. All courses specific to a student\u2019s intended major will be reviewed by the appropriate academic department. We are not able to evaluate coursework for transfer credit until an admissions decision is made.   Credit is not awarded for Pass/Fail grades and some schools and colleges at NYU have rigorous standards for credit. For example, some schools and colleges at NYU will only grant credit for courses taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students and taught by a college/university faculty member. The Stern School of Business will not award credit to freshmen for any economics, statistics, or business course taken anywhere but at Stern. In general, Stern freshmen should also not expect to receive any credits for math courses; in some cases, a student may be eligible to receive credit for calculus-level courses \u2013 but only after first completing a calculus course here at NYU.   Academic course credit will typically not be awarded for life experiences (e.g. work, internships, military service, etc.). Credit for courses taken online will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each department/school/college after admission and upon arrival at NYU, provided that the course was completed at an accredited college or university.     For transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will provide a preliminary statement of transfer credit (accessible online) at the time of admission, to give admitted students a general sense of credit allocation a student can expect to receive upon enrollment at NYU. Preliminary transfer credit evaluations will not be provided prior to admission. Decisions on the awarding of actual credit will ultimately be made by each department/school/college at NYU.     NYU Abu Dhabi does not offer credit for any examinations or previous coursework. NYU Shanghai has yet to define its credit allocation policies.                                Country-Specific Examination Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing may be awarded for country-specific examinations according to the following standards:                                                          Commonwealth Caribbean Region                               Exam: CXC Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     Minimum Score: II     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      France                               Exam: Baccalaur\u00e9at   Minimum Score: 12     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Germany                               Exam: Abitur     Minimum Score: 10     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Italy                               Exam: Esame di Stato (Maturit\u00e1)     Minimum Score: 7     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 4 credits/points                                                                      United Kingdom                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points       Exam: Cambridge Pre-U     Minimum Score: M2     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Singapore                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Switzerland                               Exam: Matura     Minimum Score: 4.5     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.   Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but must still bear an official stamp, come from a school official, and be sent from an official school email address.

Congratulations! If you are already in the U.S. as an F-1 or J-1 student at another institution, you must complete a transfer of your immigration sponsorship to transfer to or begin a new full-time program of study at NYU. Follow these steps to learn how to transfer your immigration sponsorship to NYU.              Step 1: Receive your admission letter (or electronic version) from NYU.   To be eligible for NYU sponsorship of F-1 or J-1 student status, you need to be accepted to a full-time academic program at NYU and have an official admission notice from NYU along with an NYU University ID number. If you are not yet admitted to NYU and have questions about how to apply, please visit NYU Admissions .            Step 2: Activate your NYU NetID and NYU Email.     If you don\u2019t already know your NetID, learn your NYU NetID .   If you already know your NetID, go to start.nyu.edu to activate it.   Enter your NetID and click the \u201cStart!\u201d button.              Step 3: F-1 Students Only: Complete an F-1 Transfer Form.   You must have your current international student advisor complete an F-1 Transfer Form . Once the form is completed by both you and your current international student advisor you will want to include this completed form in your I-20 Application (see step 5).        Step 3: J-1 Students Only: Discuss your eligibility to transfer to NYU\u2019s sponsorship with your current program sponsor.     If your current international student advisor determines that you are eligible to transfer to NYU, email newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu to inform us of this.   If your current international student advisor determines that you are NOT eligible to transfer to NYU, you will have to either depart and re-enter the U.S. or apply to change your status to F-1 prior to beginning your program at NYU.              Step 4: Pay tuition deposit to the NYU Admissions Office for school you will attend.            Step 5: Complete your I-20 or DS-2019 Application   The I-20/DS-2019 Application is interactive and fillable online.       Complete it online, print it, sign it, then scan it.

Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the NYU school or college after a student is admitted. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not evaluate courses for possible transfer credit before a student is admitted to NYU. Freshmen are generally awarded a maximum of 32 credits upon arrival at NYU and transfer students are generally awarded a maximum of 64 credits upon arrival at NYU. Transfer students must typically take a minimum of 64 credits at NYU to obtain a bachelor's degree from NYU.          AP Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the College Board to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (NYU's code is 2562).     IB Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the International Baccalaureate Organization to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.     College/University Course Credit   Credits Earned While In High School   Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better in the courses and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. Generally, these courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.     NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.   Credits Earned After High School   Students may be eligible for transfer credit in courses taken for credit at an accredited college within the last ten years, provided the student earned a minimum grade of &quot;C.&quot; Upon receiving an offer of admission, students will receive a detailed evaluation of transfer credit. All courses specific to a student\u2019s intended major will be reviewed by the appropriate academic department. We are not able to evaluate coursework for transfer credit until an admissions decision is made.   Credit is not awarded for Pass/Fail grades and some schools and colleges at NYU have rigorous standards for credit. For example, some schools and colleges at NYU will only grant credit for courses taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students and taught by a college/university faculty member. The Stern School of Business will not award credit to freshmen for any economics, statistics, or business course taken anywhere but at Stern. In general, Stern freshmen should also not expect to receive any credits for math courses; in some cases, a student may be eligible to receive credit for calculus-level courses \u2013 but only after first completing a calculus course here at NYU.   Academic course credit will typically not be awarded for life experiences (e.g. work, internships, military service, etc.). Credit for courses taken online will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each department/school/college after admission and upon arrival at NYU, provided that the course was completed at an accredited college or university.     For transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will provide a preliminary statement of transfer credit (accessible online) at the time of admission, to give admitted students a general sense of credit allocation a student can expect to receive upon enrollment at NYU. Preliminary transfer credit evaluations will not be provided prior to admission. Decisions on the awarding of actual credit will ultimately be made by each department/school/college at NYU.     NYU Abu Dhabi does not offer credit for any examinations or previous coursework. NYU Shanghai has yet to define its credit allocation policies.                                Country-Specific Examination Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing may be awarded for country-specific examinations according to the following standards:                                                          Commonwealth Caribbean Region                               Exam: CXC Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     Minimum Score: II     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      France                               Exam: Baccalaur\u00e9at   Minimum Score: 12     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Germany                               Exam: Abitur     Minimum Score: 10     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Italy                               Exam: Esame di Stato (Maturit\u00e1)     Minimum Score: 7     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 4 credits/points                                                                      United Kingdom                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points       Exam: Cambridge Pre-U     Minimum Score: M2     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Singapore                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Switzerland                               Exam: Matura     Minimum Score: 4.5     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

For any student applying for transfer admission in the first semester of the freshman year of college/university, the focus of our evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance.          Because our applicants come from a broad range of secondary schools around the world, we understand that the options available to students will vary widely based on the schools they attend. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools:   4 years of English with a heavy emphasis on writing;  3-4 years of history/social studies;  3-4 years of mathematics;  3-4 years of laboratory sciences; and  3-4 years of a foreign language.   Students who are highly competitive for admission will choose the most demanding coursework available in their schools, with four years in each of the subjects above.     Proof of Graduation  Admitted students must provide the Office of Undergraduate Admissions with proof of graduation by July 1 of the year they plan to enroll. Extensions will only be granted for international students who attend schools that operate on a different academic calendar. In all cases, proof of graduation must be provided prior to beginning the first semester of classes at NYU.   The following documents serve as proof of secondary school graduation:       A final high school transcript submitted directly from the student\u2019s school. We will not accept a high school transcript submitted by the student. The final high school transcript must show the date of graduation.   Results from the General Education Development (GED) Test. Click here for more information about obtaining a GED.     Original or officially certified copies of nationally recognized high school graduation examination results, such as the Advanced Level General Certificate of Education or the International Baccalaureate Diploma.     A homeschool diploma, a certificate of completion of a homeschool program that is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma in the applicant's home state, or GED test results as listed above.       Final transcripts may be submitted by a school official through the Common Application website. All hardcopy materials should bear an official stamp, be signed and mailed from a student's school in a sealed envelope to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, 11th Floor  New York, New York 10012  USA.   Documents may also be emailed to admissions.ops@nyu.edu but must still bear an official stamp, come from a school official, and be sent from an official school email address.
