NYU-TV is New York Universitys own television network of three closed-circuit television channels dedicated to serving the information, education, and entertainment needs of the campus community. Broadcast to campus buildings and residence halls, NYU-TV reaches a wide audience of undergraduates, graduates, and academic faculty and staff. NYU-TVs three channels, The University Channel , The Movie Channel , and The Happenings Channel , meet the diverse needs of the university audience.                                                  The Television Center is a campus wide resource that serves the academic community in the creation of broadcast quality video recordings in a variety of electronic media. From traditional analog recording on tape to digital options like webcasting and podcasting, the Television Center is your go-to place for all things related to video production. The TVCenter is also home to NYU-TV, and employs both professional and student staff in a variety of technical and administrative positions.                                                           NYUs Campus Cable is a private multi-channel television system serving the NYU residence halls from 26th Street down to Broome Street and nearly every hall in-between. Campus Cable has over 60 channels of programming from local broadcasters like ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, and the CW to national cable TV networks such as MTV, CNN, ESPN, and many more. What sets Campus Cable apart from regular cable TV is that three NYU-TV channels are also included in the lineup."}]},

To our knowledge, TiVo does not have any agreements with universities.                                                                Why is the Campus Cable channel line-up different than Time Warner, RCN, or Comcast?                                   Campus Cable is a private, closed-circuit system operated by NYU. As a result, the lineup differs from subscriber services such as TimeWarner, RCN, and Comcast.                                                                Do we have the option to buy premium channels or pay-per-view?                                   The Campus Cable system is a non-addressable system that is provided to all students living in most residence halls. In other words, everyone gets the same channels, and there is no need for a set top box, as one would have in a traditional home setting. As a result, the Campus Cable system provides our viewers with a service that is easy to hook up, and it provides the same cable programming to all rooms.                                                                Can we add the YES Network to the lineup for the Yankees games?                                   Being right here in NYC, we know how you feel. Many viewers would like to see the Yankee games. Unfortunately, the YES channel is not currently on the Campus Cable lineup due to licensing costs, which are similar to premium channel costs. Considering the fact that most students leave campus in May, and the games airing in September are on national local or cable channels, the increase in cost does not balance out for two and half months of programming. As always, we wish to ensure a great channel lineup (over 80 channels!) at no cost to students. As a result, we are unable to add the YES Network to our system at this time. However, we continue to monitor the rates for the this channel should there be a change and will keep you informed of any progress.
