In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    British Art in London - ARTH-UA 9011 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   A survey of British painting, sculpture and architecture of the 17th through 20th centuries. Museums, galleries, churches, palaces and stately homes in and around London will be visited to examine and critique major works.     Sample Syllabus                                                                Contemporary Art in Britain - ARTH-UA 9675 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.   Sample Syllabus                                                                  Designing Britain - ARTH-UA 9650 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Urban Design credit or Art History elective credit.   British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures and Visits to museums, London sites etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Renaissance Art in London - ARTH-UA 9350 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Seeing London's Architecture - ARTH-UA 9674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only.   London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.   Sample Syllabus                          Biology                                                    Principles of Biology II - BIOL-UA 9012 - 4 points (Lecture & Recitation)                                Prerequisite: High school chemistry and BIOL-UA 11, Principles of Biology I or equivalent   Students registering for this course must register for the Lecture &amp; Recitation.

Sample Syllabus                                                                Principles of Biology Lab - BIOL-UA 9123 - 1 point (Laboratory)                               Note: Biology majors are not required to register for this lab course. All other students should consult with their advisor to determine if the lab is a requirement of their program of study.     Laboratory exercises illustrate the basics of experimental biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry as well as the diversity of life forms and organ systems.                                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

The class focuses on the nature of financial management from a number of perspectives including the national, the corporate and the individual, but particularly the corporate. You will become familiar with the financial system, including that relating to banking, though there will be little overlap with courses that deal with the functioning of financial markets. The importance of behavioural finance will also be stressed during the course.   Sample Syllabus                                                                International Political Economy - BPEP-UB 9011 - 4 points                               The course is informed by the significant transformation the world economy is currently undergoing, paying particular attention to the evolving dynamics of international trade and the global distribution of power within a longer-term historical perspective. The result is a course strongly geared towards providing students with an understanding of contemporary international economic and political trends, issues and events alongside the requisite analytical skills to evaluate current economic and political policies.   This course is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on the political economy of international trade. It will examine the role of labour, land and capital in determining what is traded, by whom and for what purpose. The second section examines the key global issues in 21st century political economy. It will focus on cultural transformation in an age of globalization, the economic rise of Asia, the political economy of militant Islam and, most saliently, the future of Western hegemony in light of the global economic crisis.

Britain is a multi-national state, a union of 4 nations, each with their own distinctive culture and heritage. Three of the nations, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, have been brought under the English monarchy and political system, and, in the case of the first two, they have been long-term partners in the benefits accruing to the largest empire the world has seen, and the first and (for a long time) the most successful industrial nation. The height of that unity was probably in the period of the Second World War and its aftermath. Since then, with the collapse of the British Empire, Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, and the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the union has come under increasing pressure from centrifugal forces. The course examines the image that Britain presents to the world, the myths on which the national identity of the component nations were formed and the institutions that might be considered to hold the union together today. This involves looking at the self-image of Britain in relation to empire, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism, monarchy, parliament, sport and media representations. British national identity is revealed as an increasingly contested concept in a globalised world.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein and Dracula . This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels.

The course introduces students to some of the key texts of British cultural and educational policy in India. It also gives students the opportunity to examine a major ethnographic text. The course will then grapple with a cross-section of colonial and postcolonial literary representations of India. The focus here will be on issues of identity and strategies of narrative in colonialist and nationalist texts. The course concludes with an overall view of postcolonial studies as it relates to India and some suggestions as to its future developments.

Writing London - ENGL-UA 9182 - 4 points                               This course will study a variety of texts written at particular times in the history of London. The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.   Sample Syllabus                          Environmental Studies                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                Fashion's Fictions: The Texts of Clothing - IDSEM-UG 9253 - 4 points                                Please note that students accepted to the Gallatin Fashion in London Program will be given registration priority for this course.   The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    British Art in London - ARTH-UA 9011 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   A survey of British painting, sculpture and architecture of the 17th through 20th centuries.

Sample Syllabus                                                                Contemporary Art in Britain - ARTH-UA 9675 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.   Sample Syllabus                                                                  Designing Britain - ARTH-UA 9650 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Urban Design credit or Art History elective credit.   British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures and Visits to museums, London sites etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Renaissance Art in London - ARTH-UA 9350 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Seeing London's Architecture - ARTH-UA 9674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only.   London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.   Sample Syllabus                          Biology                                                    Principles of Biology II - BIOL-UA 9012 - 4 points (Lecture & Recitation)                                Prerequisite: High school chemistry and BIOL-UA 11, Principles of Biology I or equivalent   Students registering for this course must register for the Lecture &amp; Recitation.

Sample Syllabus                                                                Principles of Biology Lab - BIOL-UA 9123 - 1 point (Laboratory)                               Note: Biology majors are not required to register for this lab course. All other students should consult with their advisor to determine if the lab is a requirement of their program of study.     Laboratory exercises illustrate the basics of experimental biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry as well as the diversity of life forms and organ systems.                                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

The class focuses on the nature of financial management from a number of perspectives including the national, the corporate and the individual, but particularly the corporate. You will become familiar with the financial system, including that relating to banking, though there will be little overlap with courses that deal with the functioning of financial markets. The importance of behavioural finance will also be stressed during the course.   Sample Syllabus                                                                International Political Economy - BPEP-UB 9011 - 4 points                               The course is informed by the significant transformation the world economy is currently undergoing, paying particular attention to the evolving dynamics of international trade and the global distribution of power within a longer-term historical perspective. The result is a course strongly geared towards providing students with an understanding of contemporary international economic and political trends, issues and events alongside the requisite analytical skills to evaluate current economic and political policies.   This course is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on the political economy of international trade. It will examine the role of labour, land and capital in determining what is traded, by whom and for what purpose. The second section examines the key global issues in 21st century political economy. It will focus on cultural transformation in an age of globalization, the economic rise of Asia, the political economy of militant Islam and, most saliently, the future of Western hegemony in light of the global economic crisis.

Britain is a multi-national state, a union of 4 nations, each with their own distinctive culture and heritage. Three of the nations, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, have been brought under the English monarchy and political system, and, in the case of the first two, they have been long-term partners in the benefits accruing to the largest empire the world has seen, and the first and (for a long time) the most successful industrial nation. The height of that unity was probably in the period of the Second World War and its aftermath. Since then, with the collapse of the British Empire, Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, and the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the union has come under increasing pressure from centrifugal forces. The course examines the image that Britain presents to the world, the myths on which the national identity of the component nations were formed and the institutions that might be considered to hold the union together today. This involves looking at the self-image of Britain in relation to empire, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism, monarchy, parliament, sport and media representations. British national identity is revealed as an increasingly contested concept in a globalised world.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein and Dracula . This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels.

The course introduces students to some of the key texts of British cultural and educational policy in India. It also gives students the opportunity to examine a major ethnographic text. The course will then grapple with a cross-section of colonial and postcolonial literary representations of India. The focus here will be on issues of identity and strategies of narrative in colonialist and nationalist texts. The course concludes with an overall view of postcolonial studies as it relates to India and some suggestions as to its future developments.

Writing London - ENGL-UA 9182 - 4 points                               This course will study a variety of texts written at particular times in the history of London. The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.   Sample Syllabus                          Environmental Studies                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                Fashion's Fictions: The Texts of Clothing - IDSEM-UG 9253 - 4 points                                Please note that students accepted to the Gallatin Fashion in London Program will be given registration priority for this course.   The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

Analytical Politics Quantitative Methods in Political Science POL-UA 800 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to the use of quantitative methods in the study of politics. Begins with a brief review of the basic elements of scientific thinking and their application to the social sciences. Next, students are introduced to probability theory and statistics with a view to testing hypotheses about politics. Students learn to use statistical software to organize and analyze data. Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions POL-UA 810 Offered every year. 4 points. Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. The tools of economic theory, game theory, and social choice theory are applied to the rational choice analysis of political institutions, whose consequences for society are derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. Introduction to Political Psychology POL-UA 812 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. It introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. Introduction to Game Theory in Political Science POL-UA 840 Offered every year. 4 points. Game theory is a mathematical tool used to study strategic interactions. Whenever the choices made by two or more distinct decision makers have an effect on the others' outcomes, the interaction between them is game-theoretic in nature. As suggested by its recent emergence into popular culture, game theory has been applied widely, in attempts to address phenomena in a variety of academic disciplines, including political science, economics, and biology. Because much of politics is about allocation of scarce goods, such as power and wealth, and the competition for these goods, much of politics would seem to be a natural fit for the language of game theory. Doing Political Economy: Approaches to Public Policy POL-UA 842 Offered every semester. 4 points. Political economy is a field of inquiry that has made great strides in recent years in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. Games, Strategy, and Politics POL-UA 844 Offered every year. 4 points. Theories of political strategy with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and negotiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strategies and the uses of power, with some applications outside political science. Social Choice and Politics POL-UA 845 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals' voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions. The emphasis is analytical, though students are not expected to have a background in formal mathematics. Experimental Methods in Political Science POL-UA 846 Prerequisites: Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Designed to provide an introduction to experimental methods in political science.

Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy POL-UA 130 Offered once a year. 4 points. Students systematically evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts of normative political theory. In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to do bad in order to do good? In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it that we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Substantive policy topics vary from semester to semester. Theories of Justice POL-UA 138 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to help students think more rigorously about questions of justice by examining the strengths and weaknesses of competing contemporary theories of justice. We survey a range of influential approaches to understanding justice, including those advocated by libertarians, utilitarians, egalitarians, feminists, communitarians, and Marxists. This course should help students to (1) recognize that political convictions rest on underlying moral assumptions; (2) learn how to interrogate, challenge, and defend these assumptions; and (3) gain some appreciation of how these issues have been addressed by major figures in contemporary political theory. Socialist Theory POL-UA 140 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Concentrates on those socialist schools\u2014Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism\u2014that have proved to be the most successful.

Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict POL-UA 150 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Seeks to explain the varied forms of nationalism and extremism. To that end, we bring various psychological, economic, anthropological, and sociological theories to bear on the origins and development of nationalist movements. We attempt to understand the historical phases of nationalist development, from the early cases of Great Britain and the United States, through the later cases of Europe and Latin America, the anticolonial cases of Africa and much of Asia, and, finally, the often religiously-based movements of the present era. We also read some of the normative literature that has tried to justify nationalism, both in the abstract and in particular cases. Democracy and Dictatorship POL-UA 160 Offered every other year. 4 points. Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship.

Public Policy POL-UA 306 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered in the fall. 4 points. Introduction to public policymaking in American federal government. The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. The course examines the way the agenda is set and issues are processed in Washington. Covers Congress, the bureaucracy, program implementation, policy analysis, and budgeting. Students do a special project on an important current issue. In recent years, these issues have included Social Security reform, Medicare, and illegal immigration. The Presidency POL-UA 310 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of the American presidency, its origins, and roles, including those of commander-in-chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice.

Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies. The Biology of Politics POL-UA 311 Offered every year. 4 points. Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? When are we most likely to participate? Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, motivation, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. Recently, however, scholars have begun to explore the possibility that genetic differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political participation. Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence POL-UA 315 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Uses logic and evidence to analyze issues of public policy. Applies sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, as seen in the film Moneyball) to such vastly more important topics as improving schools, designing health policy, and dealing with climate change. Congress and Legislative Assemblies POL-UA 320 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States.

Critically examines the relationship between law and political and social movements such as the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and the labor and environmental movements. Emphasis on law as a political process, legal remedies for racial and gender discrimination, and class-action torts. Deals with the politics of rights and the limits and possibilities of law as a process for social change. Gender in Law POL-UA 336 Identical to SCA-UA 723. Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, the course also addresses to what extent understandings of gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, the course considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. The Rule of Law POL-UA 337 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology.

Offered every year. 4 points. Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. We examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas. The Politics of Administrative Law POL-UA 354 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines legal, political, and economic issues in government regulation. Covers such classic debates and issues as the historical origins of regulation, the legal philosophy of administrative regulation, the relationship between courts and agencies, the political and social conflicts surrounding regulatory politics, and the role of law in state formation.

Offered every year. 4 points. Examines how legislation and regulation influence the structure of financial markets and how players in these markets intervene in the political process to create or modify legislative and regulatory outcomes. Particular emphasis is placed on the United States. International comparisons are also present. The course assumes that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory is provided. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange. Honors Seminar: Courts, Rights, and Politics POL-UA 396 Prerequisites: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.5 GPA. Offered every year. 4 points. When we look at the protection of civil rights and liberties in the United States, we typically restrict our attention to prominent cases decided by the Supreme Court. We do so on the theory that rights and liberties are generally abused by legislative majorities, and protected by independent courts. But many important rights and liberties in the U.S. have been protected by legislative majorities, not by the federal courts. The federal courts have in fact blocked many efforts by legislatures to protect rights and liberties. Using a variety of materials, this seminar reexamines the premise that rights are best protected by independent courts. We look at the record of rights protections both in the United States and more globally. We read court cases, historical accounts, works of political theory, and statistical analyses. We also collect our own data and conduct analyses of that data. U.S. Foreign Policy POL-UA 710 Offered every year. 4 points. See \"International Politics,\" below.

Elections and Voting POL-UA 505 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300) or Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500). Offered every year. 4 points. Examines how and why elections differ so much across democracies. Is it because voters are different in these countries? Or is it because the electoral laws differ across countries? The U.S. elections are used as the frame of reference for examining the effect of institutions and voting behavior. Other countries are discussed to illustrate how cross-national differences in voting behavior and institutions can affect the electoral processes. This comparative perspective provides a better way to understand the U.S. electoral process. Western European Politics POL-UA 510 Identical to EURO-UA 510. Prerequisite: Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500). Offered every year. 4 points. Study of the politics of Britain, Ireland, France, and Germany.

Since the early 1960s, immigration has transformed European countries into multiracial and multiethnic societies. We first explore how public policy contributed to this transformation; how it was structured by different concepts, traditions, and laws on citizenship; and how it was related to transformation of the party system and the emergence of the extreme right and \"identity politics\" in Western Europe. We then analyze the impact of this transformation on attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and then to incorporate immigrants into the national community. Finally, we explore the emerging movement within the European Union to develop harmonized policies for asylum seekers and immigration at a time of growing pressures for increased immigration in Western Europe.

How debilitating will a snowed\u2010in JFK Airport be to national air travel? Why are all actors separated from Kevin Bacon by 6 degrees or fewer? Why did Blu\u2010Ray dominate HD DVD? The budding new field of Network Analysis offers the tools to answer questions like these. Network analysis is a recent import into the social sciences, and has been developed in a diverse set of fields, from physics to computer science to sociology. Recognizing that objects of study (people, genes, web pages, virus hosts, etc.) are often influenced by \u2018neighboring\u2019 objects of study, these fields have created a paradigm and a set of tools that political scientists can use to study segregation, the spread of ideas, learning, institutional design, the adoption of new technologies, epidemics, migration, trade, revolutions, and various other phenomena that involve a group of people interacting.

In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    British Art in London - ARTH-UA 9011 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.

Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.   Sample Syllabus                                                                  Designing Britain - ARTH-UA 9650 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Urban Design credit or Art History elective credit.   British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures and Visits to museums, London sites etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Renaissance Art in London - ARTH-UA 9350 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Art History elective credit.   London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Seeing London's Architecture - ARTH-UA 9674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only.   London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.   Sample Syllabus                          Biology                                                    Principles of Biology II - BIOL-UA 9012 - 4 points (Lecture & Recitation)                                Prerequisite: High school chemistry and BIOL-UA 11, Principles of Biology I or equivalent   Students registering for this course must register for the Lecture &amp; Recitation.   Introductory course mainly for science majors designed to acquaint the student with the fundamental principles and processes of biological systems. Subjects include the basics of chemistry pertinent to biology, biochemistry and cell biology, genetics and molecular biology, anatomy and physiology, neurobiology, ecology, population genetics, and history and classification of life forms and evolution.   Sample Syllabus                                                                Principles of Biology Lab - BIOL-UA 9123 - 1 point (Laboratory)                               Note: Biology majors are not required to register for this lab course. All other students should consult with their advisor to determine if the lab is a requirement of their program of study.     Laboratory exercises illustrate the basics of experimental biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry as well as the diversity of life forms and organ systems.                                                                    Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments - BIOL-UA 9140 or ENVST-UA 9275 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

Britain is a multi-national state, a union of 4 nations, each with their own distinctive culture and heritage. Three of the nations, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, have been brought under the English monarchy and political system, and, in the case of the first two, they have been long-term partners in the benefits accruing to the largest empire the world has seen, and the first and (for a long time) the most successful industrial nation. The height of that unity was probably in the period of the Second World War and its aftermath. Since then, with the collapse of the British Empire, Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union, and the devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, the union has come under increasing pressure from centrifugal forces. The course examines the image that Britain presents to the world, the myths on which the national identity of the component nations were formed and the institutions that might be considered to hold the union together today. This involves looking at the self-image of Britain in relation to empire, foreign policy, immigration and multiculturalism, monarchy, parliament, sport and media representations. British national identity is revealed as an increasingly contested concept in a globalised world.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.

The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

Sample Syllabus                                                                  Seeing London's Architecture - ARTH-UA 9674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                                Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only.   London, like New York, is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just less than 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly, this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of a European-built environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, towns and cities throughout the United States and anywhere else.                            History                                                    A History of London - HIST-UA 9127 - 4 points                               The course examines the growth and importance of London from the Roman invasion of 43 AD to the present day. Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

This course carries an additional fee of $303 to cover the cost of theatre tickets.Students should also be prepared to pay up to \u00a3100 or $160 for extra tickets while in London as part of the Methods &amp; Practice course.   Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

They are advanced seminars for juniors and seniors who are politics majors. To take any undergraduate field seminar, students must first have completed four courses in politics, one of which must be the core in that subfield. They must also have a 3.0 cumulative GPA or the permission of the instructor. Enrollment is limited.     Analytical Politics Quantitative Methods in Political Science POL-UA 800 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to the use of quantitative methods in the study of politics. Begins with a brief review of the basic elements of scientific thinking and their application to the social sciences. Next, students are introduced to probability theory and statistics with a view to testing hypotheses about politics. Students learn to use statistical software to organize and analyze data. Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions POL-UA 810 Offered every year. 4 points. Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. The tools of economic theory, game theory, and social choice theory are applied to the rational choice analysis of political institutions, whose consequences for society are derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. Introduction to Political Psychology POL-UA 812 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. It introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. Introduction to Game Theory in Political Science POL-UA 840 Offered every year. 4 points. Game theory is a mathematical tool used to study strategic interactions. Whenever the choices made by two or more distinct decision makers have an effect on the others' outcomes, the interaction between them is game-theoretic in nature. As suggested by its recent emergence into popular culture, game theory has been applied widely, in attempts to address phenomena in a variety of academic disciplines, including political science, economics, and biology. Because much of politics is about allocation of scarce goods, such as power and wealth, and the competition for these goods, much of politics would seem to be a natural fit for the language of game theory. Doing Political Economy: Approaches to Public Policy POL-UA 842 Offered every semester. 4 points. Political economy is a field of inquiry that has made great strides in recent years in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. Games, Strategy, and Politics POL-UA 844 Offered every year. 4 points. Theories of political strategy with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and negotiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strategies and the uses of power, with some applications outside political science. Social Choice and Politics POL-UA 845 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals' voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions. The emphasis is analytical, though students are not expected to have a background in formal mathematics. Experimental Methods in Political Science POL-UA 846 Prerequisites: Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Designed to provide an introduction to experimental methods in political science. Emphasizes several different styles of laboratory experiments, but field experiments (and briefly, survey experiments) are also discussed. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Analytical Politics POL-UA 895 Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 3.0 and four previous courses in politics or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points. Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in analytical politics. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.     Political Theory Political Theory (Core course) POL-UA 100 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to some outstanding theories of politics. The theories treated offer alternative conceptions of political life, and they are examined from both theoretical and historical perspectives. Among the theorists included are Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, and Marx. Topics in Premodern Political Philosophy POL-UA 110 Formerly Political Thought from Plato to Machiavelli. Identical to MEDI-UA 110. Offered every other year. 4 points. Intensive introduction to the major themes of Western political thought. Topics in Modern Political Thought: 1500 to the Present POL-UA 120 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy POL-UA 130 Offered once a year. 4 points. Students systematically evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts of normative political theory. In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to do bad in order to do good? In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it that we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Substantive policy topics vary from semester to semester. Theories of Justice POL-UA 138 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to help students think more rigorously about questions of justice by examining the strengths and weaknesses of competing contemporary theories of justice. We survey a range of influential approaches to understanding justice, including those advocated by libertarians, utilitarians, egalitarians, feminists, communitarians, and Marxists. This course should help students to (1) recognize that political convictions rest on underlying moral assumptions; (2) learn how to interrogate, challenge, and defend these assumptions; and (3) gain some appreciation of how these issues have been addressed by major figures in contemporary political theory. Socialist Theory POL-UA 140 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Concentrates on those socialist schools\u2014Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism\u2014that have proved to be the most successful. Presents their major theories and examines the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live. Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict POL-UA 150 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Seeks to explain the varied forms of nationalism and extremism. To that end, we bring various psychological, economic, anthropological, and sociological theories to bear on the origins and development of nationalist movements. We attempt to understand the historical phases of nationalist development, from the early cases of Great Britain and the United States, through the later cases of Europe and Latin America, the anticolonial cases of Africa and much of Asia, and, finally, the often religiously-based movements of the present era. We also read some of the normative literature that has tried to justify nationalism, both in the abstract and in particular cases. Democracy and Dictatorship POL-UA 160 Offered every other year. 4 points. Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship. American Political Thought POL-UA 170 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present. Topics include Puritanism, revolution and independence, the framing of the Constitution, Hamiltonian nationalism, Jeffersonian republicanism, Jacksonian democracy, pro-slavery and antislavery thought, Civil War and Reconstruction, social Darwinism and laissez-faire, the reformist thought of populism, progressivism and socialism, legal realism, the New Deal and 20th-century liberalism, modern conservatism, civil rights, and war protest. Readings and discussion are based on original and interpretative sources. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Political Theory POL-UA 195 Prerequisites: Political Theory (POL-UA 100) and three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.0 GPA, or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. 4 points. Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in political theory. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.      American Government and Politics Power and Politics in America (Core course) POL-UA 300 Offered every semester. 4 points. A survey of national political institutions and behavior in the United States, which introduces students to a variety of analytical concepts and approaches useful for the study of domestic politics. Concepts typically covered include public goods and collective action; preference aggregation and the median voter theorem; delegation, representation, and accountability; agenda control; interbranch bargaining; and the mechanisms of private influence on public policy. Public Policy POL-UA 306 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered in the fall. 4 points. Introduction to public policymaking in American federal government. The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. The course examines the way the agenda is set and issues are processed in Washington. Covers Congress, the bureaucracy, program implementation, policy analysis, and budgeting. Students do a special project on an important current issue. In recent years, these issues have included Social Security reform, Medicare, and illegal immigration. The Presidency POL-UA 310 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of the American presidency, its origins, and roles, including those of commander-in-chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice. The president is also viewed as a decision maker and compared with the heads of other governments. Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies. The Biology of Politics POL-UA 311 Offered every year. 4 points. Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? When are we most likely to participate? Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, motivation, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. Recently, however, scholars have begun to explore the possibility that genetic differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political participation. Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence POL-UA 315 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Uses logic and evidence to analyze issues of public policy. Applies sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, as seen in the film Moneyball) to such vastly more important topics as improving schools, designing health policy, and dealing with climate change. Congress and Legislative Assemblies POL-UA 320 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States. Although some attention is given to state legislatures and municipal lawmaking bodies, the major emphasis is on the Congress.

Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, the course also addresses to what extent understandings of gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, the course considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. The Rule of Law POL-UA 337 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology. This course explores the theory surrounding the rule of law ideal. It focuses on the political conditions that promote the rule of law as well as on the challenges to the rule of law in times of emergencies. Topics include the connection between law and morality, the political foundation of the rule of law, the interaction among political institutions in promoting or subverting the rule of law, the rule of law in times of crisis, the effects of emergency powers on the rule of law, and the rule of law and terrorism prevention.

Private Influence in Public Policy POL-UA 341 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. In this course, we will examine the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, and the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the overcoming the challenges associated with demonstrating influence empirically. American Public Opinion POL-UA 342 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Covers two areas of great importance to American democratic society. One area deals with the attempts made to define, identify, survey, analyze, and evaluate the influence of what is referred to as public opinion.

Offered every year. 4 points. Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. We examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas. The Politics of Administrative Law POL-UA 354 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines legal, political, and economic issues in government regulation. Covers such classic debates and issues as the historical origins of regulation, the legal philosophy of administrative regulation, the relationship between courts and agencies, the political and social conflicts surrounding regulatory politics, and the role of law in state formation.

Study of politics and politicians in the contemporary American city. Evolution of local party organizations, the rise and fall of party \"bosses,\" and the predicament of the ordinary citizen in the urban community. Patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community.

Specifically, focuses on the political behavior of minority citizens, the relative strength and effect of these groups at the polls and in political office, the theory and practice of group formation as it applies to minority groups, the responsiveness of elected officials, and the legal and constitutional obstacles and instruments that provide context and shape these phenomena. The Politics of Poverty and Welfare POL-UA 382 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered in the spring. 4 points. Poverty and welfare problems in the United States and the controversies aroused by them. Concentrates on the causes of poverty and dependency among the working-age poor, the history of programs and policies meant to help them, and the enormous impact these issues have had on national politics.

Honors Seminar: Courts, Rights, and Politics POL-UA 396 Prerequisites: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.5 GPA. Offered every year. 4 points. When we look at the protection of civil rights and liberties in the United States, we typically restrict our attention to prominent cases decided by the Supreme Court. We do so on the theory that rights and liberties are generally abused by legislative majorities, and protected by independent courts. But many important rights and liberties in the U.S. have been protected by legislative majorities, not by the federal courts. The federal courts have in fact blocked many efforts by legislatures to protect rights and liberties. Using a variety of materials, this seminar reexamines the premise that rights are best protected by independent courts. We look at the record of rights protections both in the United States and more globally. We read court cases, historical accounts, works of political theory, and statistical analyses. We also collect our own data and conduct analyses of that data. U.S. Foreign Policy POL-UA 710 Offered every year. 4 points. See \"International Politics,\" below.

Examines how and why elections differ so much across democracies. Is it because voters are different in these countries? Or is it because the electoral laws differ across countries? The U.S. elections are used as the frame of reference for examining the effect of institutions and voting behavior. Other countries are discussed to illustrate how cross-national differences in voting behavior and institutions can affect the electoral processes. This comparative perspective provides a better way to understand the U.S. electoral process. Western European Politics POL-UA 510 Identical to EURO-UA 510.

We then analyze the impact of this transformation on attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and then to incorporate immigrants into the national community. Finally, we explore the emerging movement within the European Union to develop harmonized policies for asylum seekers and immigration at a time of growing pressures for increased immigration in Western Europe.

The budding new field of Network Analysis offers the tools to answer questions like these. Network analysis is a recent import into the social sciences, and has been developed in a diverse set of fields, from physics to computer science to sociology. Recognizing that objects of study (people, genes, web pages, virus hosts, etc.) are often influenced by \u2018neighboring\u2019 objects of study, these fields have created a paradigm and a set of tools that political scientists can use to study segregation, the spread of ideas, learning, institutional design, the adoption of new technologies, epidemics, migration, trade, revolutions, and various other phenomena that involve a group of people interacting.

Syllabus : [ Stevens F07 ][ Stevens F08 ] [ Acikgoz S13 ]          POL-UA 810 - Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. In this course, the tools of economic theory, game theory, and social-choice theory will be applied to the rational-choice analysis of political, economic, and social institutions, whose consequences for society will be derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. The product of such analysis, which is reflected in the title of this course, is normative: To design institutions that meet certain \u201cengineering\u201d specifications and, therefore, may be superior to institutions that, because they arose more haphazardly, may not satisfy these specifications. Like engineering in the natural sciences, which translates theory (e.g., from physics) into practical design (e.g., a bridge), engineering in the social sciences translates rational-choice analysis into the design of better political-economic-social institutions.    Syllabus : [ Brams S05 ] [ Brams S11 ]          POL-UA 812- Introduction to Political Psychology This course offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. The course introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics.    Syllabus: [ Dickson F08 ]          POL-UA 840 -- Introduction to Game Theory This course introduces the basic concepts of elementary game theory in a way that allows you to use them in solving simple problems. And second, it gives a flavor of how game theory can be used in the study of political science by presenting a wide array of example applications. In addition, throughout the course we will discuss evidence from experiments and from other sources that bears on when we should expect game theory to be most useful in applied studies, and when we might reasonably have doubts about the types of predictions that it makes about human behavior. Syllabus : [ Hafer F14 ]       POL-UA 842 -- Doing Political Economy    Political economy has made great strides in recent year in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this class is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. First students are introduced to the tools of modern political economy. In a relatively non-mathematical manner students will also learn the conceptual basis of statistical testing. These tools are then applied to policy problems in three substantive areas: international relations, American politics and comparative politics. Through these methods and their application students will learn how to evaluate public policy using theory and evidence. Syllabus : [ Smith F10 ]          POL-UA 844 - Games, Strategy, and Politics Theories of political strategy, with emphasis on the theory of games.

Syllabus - [ Browne F12 ]                     Political Theory           POL-UA 100 - Political Theory (Core Course) This course is an introduction to the history of political theory. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. Despite the age of some of the texts with which we will wrestle, the purpose of the course is not exclusively historical. Instead, part of the reason that these texts are widely seen as classics is because they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. It is through the categories created and clarified by these thinkers that we conceptualize, understand, and assess our political lives. Syllabus : [ Kates Sum10 ] [ Pevnick S11 ]          POL-UA 110 - Topics in Premodern Political Philosophy Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Intensive introduction to the major themes of Western political thought through a careful analysis of classical and medieval works. Among the authors studied are Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, and St. Thomas Aquinas. Formerly Political Thought from Plato to Machiavelli.          POL-UA 120 - Modern Political Thought: 1500 to the Present Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche.          POL-UA 120 - Nietzsche and the 20th Century In Germany in the twentieth century, Nietzsche was revered by Zionists, anti-Semites, German nationalists, cosmopolitans, conservatives, anarchists, royalists, atheists and the religious. Who was this figure who managed to inspire such contradictory adherents?   We begin by examining Nietzsche\u2019s work so that we can come to some understanding of who he was. Then we look at how, and why, he influenced so many of the major thinkers of the twentieth century. The course is designed to offer students a new way to think about modernity, modern political thought, and the century from which we have just escaped. Classes will be devoted to detailed discussions of the readings.  Syllabus: [ O'Brien ]           POL-UA 130 -- Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy This course will provide students the ability systematically to evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts from normative political theory. We consider four overarching questions: Should public officials be responsible to universal laws of morality? By what criteria do we evaluate the ends of public policy? Are the intentions and internal psychological state of the public official morally relevant? How do we evaluate moral choices when outcomes depend on the decisions of more than one individual? In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to \"do bad in order to do good?\" In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Topics for this semester include the decision to drop the atomic bomb in World War II, the treatment of terrorist suspects, lying in office, racial profiling, the analysis of environmental policy, health care allocation, social welfare policy, capital punishment, international intervention in humanitarian crises, and collective responsibility in office.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S05 ]         POL-UA 138- Theories of Justice Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 This course is an undergraduate-level introduction to the subject of justice in contemporary Anglo-American political theory. Its aim is to provide students with an understanding of the current state of the theoretical literature on justice as well as to enable them to engage in their own critical thinking about the topic. For the most part, discussion proceeds in chronological order. We begin with the study of utilitarianism\u2014the dominant approach to political philosophy in the modern era. From there we proceed to a thorough treatment of the political philosopher who has, arguably, dominated the contemporary scene: John Rawls. In particular, we shall examine the arguments put forward in A Theory of Justice for what he calls \u201cjustice as fairness\u201d\u2014a conception of justice that he believed to be superior to that articulated by utilitarians. But in developing his own distinctively contractarian conception of justice, Rawls was, however, subject to much criticism. For that reason, we turn next to a variety of alternative conceptions of justice put forward in direct contrast to his position: namely, libertarianism, luck egalitarianism and the capabilities approach, Marxism, communitarianism, and, finally, feminism.    In the latter half of the course we focus on a number of related problems that have been at issue in contemporary discussions of justice. More specifically, we explore the question of whether principles of justice apply solely within the boundaries of particular states or whether their application is global in scope instead. Next, we consider whether principles of justice fix our relations with our contemporaries alone or whether they further constrain our actions towards future generations as well. In a related manner, we also ask how, if at all, justice constrains our relations with non-human animals. We end, finally, by considering whether justice and democracy conflict, and, if so, which ought to receive priority in practical political action.    Syllabus : [ Kates S11 ]          POL-UA 140 - Socialist Theory Concentrates on those socialist schools-Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism-that have proved to be the most successful. Aims to present their major theories and to examine the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live.    Syllabus : [ Ollman F07 ] [ Ollman F10 ]          POL-UA 150 - Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 This course will focus on ways to understand nationalism and ethnic identification and the conflict that they sometimes stimulate. Readings will be from varied perspectives. This course is a discussion seminar.    Syllabus : [ Hardin S07 ]           POL-UA 160 - Democracy and Dictatorship Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship.    Syllabus : [ Erbal Sum07 ]          POL-UA 170 - American Political Thought 4 points -- Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present.

The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.    Syllabus : Constitution-Making [ Pasquino F07 ]    Justice [ Hardin S07 ]    Dialectical Methodology [ Ollman S07 ]    Contemporary Democratic Theory [ Pevnick F09 ], [ Pevnick F10 ][ Pevnick S13 ]    Theories of Justice [ Pevnick S10 ][ Pevnick S13 ]          POL-UA 994 - Law and Courts    The general topic of the lectures will be the role of the judicial power in constitutional democracies. Notwithstanding the well know increasing role of courts in our societies political theory doesn't pay enough attention to the judicial power in the institutional structure of the separation of powers. The course will start from considering and analyzing the classical doctrine of the separation of powers (Locke, Montesquieu, J. Madison, A. Hamilton, the anti-federalist Brutus, A. Bergasse) in order to identify the limits of it concerning the role assigned to the judiciary. We will moreover consider the general theory if the judicial institutions from Aristotle to Coke, Hobbes and to the contemporary debates (the Scandinavian School, M. Shapiro, P. Stein).The last section of the course will be devoted to Supreme/Constitutional Courts and to the new balance of powers in the contemporary world.    Syllabus :           POL-UA 994 - The Constitution in the Age of Terror Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course will examine in depth the legal, moral, social and political context for counter-terrorism. It will attempt to frame issues of strategy and policy within the moral tradition of just war doctrine and the constitutional values embraced by the Supreme Court of the United States and the international courts in the Nuremberg tradition. We will read widely in journalism, philosophy, policy and law, with a number of classes devoted to court decisions.    Syllabus : [ Gerety S07 ]          POL-UA 994 - Law and Morality in the Age of Terror Prerequisite: POL-UA 100   This course seeks to deepen our understanding of the law and policy of counter-terrorism by approaching the challenges of terrorist attacks from several points of view. Notably, we will deploy moral philosophy, international and domestic law, social science--and of course policy studies , including arguments over institutional arrangements. Over the semester we will examine a variety of cases and hypotheses, touching on such matters as interrogation and torture, killing and assassination, detention and trial.  If the student has taken a course in AD that has been approved as equivalent to the POL-UA 100, can we issue a permission code, or would you prefer to do so.    Syllabus : [ Gerety S11 ]          POL-UA 994 - Religion and Politics Our focus in this course will be on the relationship between Christianity and liberal democracy in the modern era. In part one, we will read texts from the modern liberal canon with the intention of understanding the differing modes of engagement with religion, we will see that this has entailed neutrality, rejection, or an embrace whether warm or stifling. None of these approaches have been wholly successful, or a complete failure. In part two, we look at Nietzsche\u2019s claim that God is \u201cdead\u201d and see how this claim has been used, and abused, by subsequent thinkers. Overall, the course will offer students a new way to think about the evolving relationship between religion and politics and the ways in which it shapes our lives..

The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. Looks at the operations of the government in the terms Washingtonians use. Examines the roles of Congress and the bureaucracy; the procedures of budgeting and regulatory agencies; and the issues in several concrete areas of policy, mainly in the domestic area. Excellent preparation for students planning to take the Washington Semester Program.    Syllabus : [ Mead F07 ]           POL-UA 310 - The Presidency Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Study of the American presidency, its origins and roles, including those of commander in chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice.

Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies.    Syllabus : [ Kim S07 ]          POL-UA 311 - The Biology of Politics    Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? Why do individuals have the political attitudes they do? These questions are central to the study of politics. Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, mobilization, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. However, scholars have recently begun to explore the possibility that biological differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political attitudes and behavior. This course explores the relationship between biology and political behavior with an emphasis on how the two may be linked.    Syllabus : [ Dawes S12 ] [ Dawes S13 ]          POL-UA 315 - Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence This course is about using logic to think about issues of public policy and evidence to do the same thing. One way to think about this course is it is sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, and in Moneyball) applied to vastly more important topics than baseball: making schools better, designing health policy and dealing with climate change (with tons of other policy applications possible, but we will focus on these three).    Syllabus: [ Beck S13 ]          POL-UA 320 - Congress and Legislative Assemblies Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States. Although some attention is given to state legislatures and municipal lawmaking bodies, the major emphasis is on the Congress. Readings include a textbook, official sources such as the Congressional Record and Congressional District Data Book, and the new behavioral studies and commentaries.          POL-UA 330 - The American Constitution This course examines the major contours of the American Constitution excluding the Bill of Rights. We will discuss constitutional law in the broader framework of social and political philosophy and explore evolution of judicial doctrine through our constitutional history. The two major themes that run through most of the cases are federalism and separation of powers.    Syllabus : [Kawar F07] [ Rajsingh S07 ] [ Harrington F06 ] [ Rajsingh S11 ]          POL-UA 332 - Civil Liberties Interpretation of the Bill of Rights, the Civil War Amendments, and other rights in the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Topics include freedom of speech and press; free exercise of religion and separation of church and state; the right of privacy; rights of the criminally accused; equal protection of the law against race, gender, and other discrimination; and the rights of franchise and citizenship.

Syllabus : [ Rajsingh S06 ] [ Khan F08 ] [ Harrington S13 ]          POL-UA 333 - The United States Supreme Court Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course provides an introduction to current research on Supreme Court decision making. Specifically, the primary focus of the course is on why the Justices decide cases in the way that they do. However, we will also look at the Justices\ufffd decisions on writs of certiorari, and at the process by which the Justices are nominated and confirmed to the Court.    Syllabus : [ Harvey S07 ]          POL-UA 334 - American Law and Legal System Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Introduction to law and the legal system through the reading of actual cases. Topics include the adjudication of conflict, the structure and functions of trial and appellate courts, civil and criminal procedure, judicial remedies, judicial decision making, and the limits of judicial relief. Uses tort, contract, property, divorce, and other law for illustration.          POL-UA 335 - Law and Society Identical to V62.0001 and V18.0722 This course studies the relationship between law and society by studying the nature of \u201crights\u201d and \u201crights claims.\u201d The topics will address many issues and debates, but we will focus particularly on several main questions. What are the different theoretical bases for rights claims? How does the law impact what rights individuals and groups in civil society fight for, and the way they frame their claims? What happens when different rights claims conflict with one another? What is the difference between a right and a policy preference, and how do those different classifications affect discourse and public policy?    Syllabus : [ Harrington F10 ] [ Ferri S11 ]          POL-UA 336 - Gender in Law    Identical to V18.0723 Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, also addresses to what extent understandings of the gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. Syllabus : [ Harrington S10 ]          POL-UA 337 - The Rule of Law    The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology. This seminar explores the theory surrounding the rule of law ideal. It focuses on the political conditions that promote the rule of law as well as on the challenges to the rule of law in time of emergencies. Topics include the connection between law and morality, the political foundation of the rule of law, the interaction among political institutions in promoting or subverting the rule of law, the rule of law in times of crisis, the eects of emergency powers on the rule of law, and the rule of law and terrorism prevention. Syllabus : [ Dragu S13 ]          POL-UA 340 - Political Parties Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Background, structure, operation, and definition of the party systems. Development of the two-party system in the United States from its origins to the present. Formal organization of parties on the national and state levels and control of the parties within the state. Party politics in the South, political machines, ethnic politics, nominations for public office, and pressure groups on the party system. The national election from first stirrings of potential candidates through the general election.          POL-UA 342 - American Public Opinion Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 What do Americans think about politics? Why do they hold these beliefs? And does it matter? This course grapples with these three questions, which lie at the core of our understanding of the health of American democratic society. In doing so, the class will give students the tools they need to critically assess the construction, conduct, and reporting of public opinion surveys.    Syllabus : [ Egan F07 ] [ Egan F08 ] [ Egan F10 ] [ Egan S13 ]          POL-UA 344 The Election Process Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Provides an understanding of election processes in the United States through different theoretical approaches to the study of campaigns and elections and the testing of empirical hypotheses. Analyzes campaign strategies of political candidates, the use of polls and media in campaigns, and the effects of issues and personalities on election outcomes. Evaluates the role of presidential primaries and elections in the functioning of a democracy.    Syllabus : [ Morton F06 ] [ Nagler S10 ]          POL-UA 350 - Bureaucracy and Public Policy Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. In this course, we will examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we will draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S07 ]          POL-UA 353 - The Military and                Defense in American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Role of the military establishment in the exercise of power and in contemporary American politics.

The defense industry and its links with the military and Congress. Appraisal of the military-industrial complex.          POL-UA 354 - The Politics of Administrative Law Examines legal, political, and economic issues in government regulation. Covers such classic debates and issues as the historical origins of regulation, the legal philosophy of administrative regulation, the relationship between courts and agencies, the political and social conflicts surrounding regulatory politics, and the role of law in state formation.

Syllabus : [Turem F07] [ Harrington S06 ] [ Harrington F10 ]          POL-UA 360 - Urban Government and Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Identical to V99.0371 Study of politics and politicians in the contemporary American city. Evolution of local party organizations, the rise and fate of party \"bosses,\" and the predicament of the ordinary citizen in the urban community. Patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community. Conceptions of effective leadership in urban politics and the role of the police, the press, and \"good government\" groups in local political life.          POL-UA 380 Minority Representation in American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course is an exploration of whether and how racial and ethnic minorities are able to organize effectively and press their demands through the American political system. Specifically, we will focus on the political behavior of minority citizens, the relative strength and effect of these groups at the polls and in political office, the theory and practice of group formation as it applies to minority groups, the responsiveness of elected officials, and the legal and constitutional obstacles and instruments that provide context and shape these phenomena. As this course is also part of the Alexander Hamilton Center for Political Economy we focus primarily on how different public policies can be used to enhance or reduce minority representation in American politics. We examine how public policies can affect both descriptive and substantive representation.    Syllabus : [ Morton F06 ] [ Morton S08 ]          POL-UA 382 - The Politics of Poverty and Welfare Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Poverty and welfare problems in the United States and the controversies aroused by them. Concentrates on the causes of poverty and dependency among the controversial working-age poor, the history of programs and policies meant to help them, and the enormous impact these issues have had on national politics.    Syllabus : [ Mead S10 ]          POL-UA 385 - Political Economy: The United States in Comparative Perspective Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 or POL-UA 500 This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including the politics of economic reform, party systems and voting, theories of ethnic politics, and social capital.    Students in the Alexander Hamilton Institute honors sections will also focus on how the lessons of rigorous political science can be used to inform public policy decisions.    Syllabus : [ Tucker S09 ]          POL-UA 395 - Undergraduate Field Seminar: American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in American politics. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each semester.    Syllabus : Congressional Elections [ Nagler F13 ]    The Politics of Judicial Decision Making [ Harvey S07 ]    Minority Representation in American Politics [ Morton S07 ]    Welfare Politics [ Mead S05 ]       Spring 2011 Seminars:    Interest Groups We will be examining the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the difficulty of demonstrating influence empirically despite the \"you know it when you see it\" flavor of contemporary journalistic accounts.    Congressional Elections and Competitiveness    A prominent fact of congressional elections in the United States is the frequency with which they are won by incumbents. The lack of competition in these elections will be the focus of this course. To understand this lack of competition we will cover considerable ground: the basic facts of re-election rates, the amount of money spent by incumbents and challengers, and the nature of congressional districts. We will also cover existing theories and evidence about the behavior of voters that maintains so many incumbents in o ce: including the impact of issues, the impact of campaign spending, and whether or not voters have become more polarized. We will also look at the extent to which congressional elections are decided by national forces versus conditions peculiar to the individual race (see 1994, 2006, 2010). In trying to understand why congressional elections have become so uncompetitive we will look at possible reforms to increase competitiveness. We will also consider the impact of the behavior of the major parties on the competitiveness of elections, and examine how changes in party strategies could lead to more competitive elections. Syllabus: [ Nagler S11 ]          POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Politics and Finance Prerequisites: POL-UA 300, three other politics courses, Junior or Senior standing, 3.5 GPA and one course in Economics. This seminar examines how legislation and regulation influences the structure of financial markets and how players in these markets intervene in the political process to create or modify legislative and regulatory outcomes. Particular emphasis will be placed on the United States. International comparisons will also be present. The class will assume that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory will be provided. The approach will be similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions will be made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.    Syllabus : [ Rosenthal F10 ] [ Rosenthal F11 ]        POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Politics and Courts    Prerequisites: POL-UA 300 and three other politics courses, 3.5 GPA This seminar will examine the question of judicial independence. Our two primary questions are: Are federal courts in the United States independent of the elected branches? Should they be? We will read secondary and primary sources, the latter including both judicial opinions and quantitative data, and talk about how one might answer these questions. We will also look at state courts, and at how courts function in other countries. Students will write brief weekly responses to the readings, as well as develop a research paper on the question of judicial independence.    Syllabus : [ Harvey S11 ]          POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Slavery, Inequality, and the Constitution    This seminar will explore recent work on the growth and causes of income inequality in the United States. We will particularly focus on the role of political institutions in contributing to or lessening income inequality. We will also examine the choices made in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and consider the consequences of those choices for the later growth of income inequality in the United States. Finally, we will read recent work on the effects of colonial-era inequality, including the institution of slavery, on later constitutional choices. We will read secondary work, both qualitative and quantitative, and explore currently available datasets. Students will write weekly response papers and will complete a final research paper.   POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Political Economy of Inequality    Over the past four decades, the United States has experienced dramatic increases in economic inequality, political polarization, and the percentage of the population that is foreign born. It has experienced a dramatic decrease in market regulation, especially financial markets. The seminar will investigate how these major changes in American society tie together. We will seek to understand why the increase in inequality has not been counterbalanced by a political process that would lead to more taxation and more redistribution. In particular, we will ask why, after the financial crisis of 2007-08 was ruinous for millions of Americans, Congress moved sharply to the right with the rise of the Tea Party and the Republican success in the midterm elections of 2010. Syllabus: [ Rosenthal F13 ]  POL-UA 341: Private Influence in Public Policy    In this course, we will examine the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, and the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the overcoming the challenges associated with demonstrating influence empirically.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S13 ]                    Comparative Politics           POL-UA 500 - Comparative Politics (Core Course) We study politics in a comparative context, not as a form of intellectual tourism, but to broaden and deepen our understanding of important and general political processes. We do this by making systematic comparisons between political systems that are similar in many respects, but nonetheless differ in important ways. This allows us to analyze the effect of these differences in a careful and rigorous way, enriching our understanding of how politics works. The philosophy of this course is thus to concentrate on a group of developed countries that are similar in many important ways, seeking to analyze core features of representative democracy by making systematic comparisons between countries. (Other courses in comparative politics offered by the department focus more on developing countries.)    Syllabus : [ Tucker F10 ] [ Laver S06 ] [ Laver S10 ] [ Tucker F11 ]          POL-UA 505 Elections and Voting Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 or POL-UA 500 Perhaps no other political activity is as important for public policy in democratic (and even quasi-democratic) countries as voting and elections, which determine who the ultimate policy makers will be. Thus if we ever hope to understand why governments produce the policies they do, we have to begin by asking why people vote the way they do. Why do certain parties and candidates lose elections, while others win? How important is the economy in influencing election results? And why do some people choose not to vote at all? As democracy in its various forms spreads across the globe, more and more people are voting. In response, this course studies elections and voting as a truly international phenomenon. Topics closely related to voting and elections - such as political parties, electoral rules and systems, and partisan identification - are explored as well. Students will also use to learn political science methods based on logic and evidence to explore competing explanations for these and other questions.    Syllabus : [ Tucker S07 ]          POL-UA 510 - Western European Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Identical to V42.0510 Study of the politics of Britain, Ireland, France, and the German Federal Republic.

Syllabus : [Schain F07] [ Rama S04 ] [ Schain F10 ]          POL-UA 511 Immigration and Politics in Western Europe Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 In this course we will explore immigration and patterns of immigrant incorporation in Western Europe in comparative perspective (mostly with the United States). Since the early 1960s immigration has transformed European countries into multi-racial and multi-ethnic societies. We will first explore how public policy contributed to this transformation, how it was structured by different concepts, traditions and laws on citizenship, and how it was related to transformation of the party system and the emergence of the extreme right and \u201cidentity politics\u201d in Western Europe.    Syllabus : [ Schain S07 ]          POL-UA 512 - Italian Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th-century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism.

Examines the continuing conflict and terrorism in Northern Ireland and dynamics of change in the Thatcher era and beyond.          POL-UA 520 - Government and Politics of the Former Soviet Union Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Introduction to the study of the politics of the Soviet Union and its successor, the Commonwealth of Independent States. Considers the origins and evolution of the political and economic systems, the distribution of political power, the degree of mass participation, and the sources of change and continuity in Soviet politics and society. Also deals with contemporary issues, including the politics of economic reform, the resurgence of ethnic politics, and the collapse of Communism and its aftermath.          POL-UA 522 - East European Government and Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Introduction to the politics of Eastern and Central European countries. Considers political, social, and economic developments in these countries during the post-Versailles period.

Syllabus : [ Rama S03 ]           POL-UA 525 - Modern Greek Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Introduction to the politics of modern Greece. No prior knowledge of modern Greece, Greek history, or Greek politics is assumed. Places Greece in a wider comparative and theoretical context. Focuses on domestic politics with an emphasis on political history, party politics, and political economy, as well as the relation between contemporary politics and society.          POL-UA 527 - Politics of Southern Europe Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Introduction to the politics of Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece. Based on a comparative perspective rather than a case-oriented approach. Focuses on the political institutions of the four countries, their party systems, their political economies, and the relation between state and civil societies. Examines their authoritarian experiences, their transitions to democracy, and the consolidation of their democratic polities.          POL-UA 530 - Politics of Latin America This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development. Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world? Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada? Why did so many countries fell to dictatorship in the 20th Century? Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order? How does democracy perform in Latin America? Why have some Latin American countries performed better than others? What are the challenges for Latin America into the future? The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. The course will focus on institutional theories, but we will also discuss alternative theories. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism, amongst others. In doing so, we will study differences as well as commonalities across different Latin American countries.    Syllabus : [ C.

Syllabus : [ Zubida F05 ]          POL-UA 584 - Contemporary African Politics This course offers an introduction to contemporary African politics. Our goal is to introduce students to the most pressing problems African countries have faced since independence. Questions motivating the course include: (1) Why state institutions weaker in African than in other developing regions? (2) What explains Africa's slow economic growth? (3) What can be done to improve political accountability on the continent? (4) Why have some African countries been plagued by high levels of political violence while others have not? (5) Can or should the West attempt to \"save\" Africa?    The course is structured in three parts. In the first, we will review Africa's recent political history, concentrating on the impacts of colonialism, and the types of states created in the wake of African independence movements. Then we turn to the challenges post-colonial governments face as they attempt to manage the interests of ethnically diverse societies, and reform their economies and political institutions. We end the course with an in-depth look at patterns of violent conflict across Africa, and the daunting tasks that many African countries face as they attempt to recover from conflict.    Syllabus : [ Scacco S11]          POL-UA 994- Political and Bureaucratic Corruption Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Political and bureaucratic corruption affects the quality of public policy, and indirectly the well-being of millions of people. Empirical evidence shows that corruption slows economic development, biases government expenditures, and reinforces income inequality. What do political science and economics know about the phenomenon? This course surveys the recent literature on the political economy of corruption. Theoretical and empirical perspectives are introduced. Corruption can be understood as the collusion between special interests and politicians, against citizens. Possible causes (cultural traditions, the design of political institutions, the distribution of resources in a society) and motives (e.g., private greed, the need to finance political parties) are explored. Some attention is also paid to the possible solutions: transparency, electoral accountability, a free media market, independent prosecutors, and better pay for public servants.

Syllabus : Ethnic Identity Politics and Democracy [ Chandra F07 ]       POL-UA 597 - Networks and Politics Are segregated neighborhoods always the result of discrimination? If a revolution is brewing, how many people must the revolutionaries personally recruit in order to incite widespread revolution? How debilitating will a snowed-in JFK Airport be to national air travel? Why are all actors separated from Kevin Bacon by 6 degrees or fewer? Why did Blu-Ray dominate HD DVD? The budding new field of Network Analysis offers the tools to answer questions like these. Network analysis is a recent import into the social sciences, and has been developed in a diverse set of fields, from physics to computer science to sociology. Recognizing that objects of study (people, genes, web pages, virus hosts, etc.) are often influenced by \u2018neighboring\u2019 objects of study, these fields have created a paradigm and a set of tools that political scientists can use to study segregation, the spread of ideas, learning, institutional design, the adoption of new technologies, epidemics, migration, trade, revolutions, and various other phenomena that involve a group of people interacting. The blend of networks and political science covered in this course will reveal a wealth of untapped research opportunities and chances to make real contributions to the field of political science. This course assumes no background in social network analysis; we will begin with the basics. By the end of the course, you will have the skills necessary to explain or make predictionsabout real world political phenomena using network techniques. You will also develop the invaluable skill of extracting meaning from academic articles that assume a level oftechnical proficiency above your own\u2014a skill that will serve you well in academia, the world of consulting, and beyond.

POL-UA 994 - Causes and Consequences of Globalization \"Globalization\" is a conceptual stand-in for highly complex, interdependent interactions between economies, polities, cultures, and almost all other national-level social constructs. Globalization has accrued a mass of de nitions and interpretations which cannot be reconciled easily (if at all) with one another as a result of its multifaceted nature. We will consequently focus on only two of globalization's faces\" in this course: economic and political globalization. After wrestling the with de ning and understanding the concept globalization, the course will be divided into two parts. The rst part of the course focuses on understanding and analyzing the causes and e ects of economic globalization, i.e. the increased interconnectedness of national and regional economies via lowered trade barriers, intensfi ed nancial ows, and increased labor mobility. We consider previous eras of globalization and theories of economic growth that inform arguments for increased globalization, focusing on the economics of neo-instutionalism. We spend a week each on trade liberalization, capital ows, and the role of multinational corporations in the international economy. We end the rst part of the course with a discussion of the domestic sects of globalization. The second part of the course turns to the globalization of political ideas as well as the s ects of the globalized economy on political outcomes. Again, we revisit the past and consider the role of economic growth and the dissemination of ideas in understanding political order. We cover both regime transitions nd stability in the face of economic shocks. We then analyze the role of national political competition in furthering or abating globalization. We then turn towards the e ects of an older era of globalization|the colonial period|onmore current political phenomena. We nish the course with the consequences of democracy promotion in the developing world.
