Academics        Week One: England's Medieval Heroes and Villains  July 19\u201325, 2015  Tutor: Elizabeth Gemmill, Ph.D.   Medieval England is rich in the tapestry of heroes and villains. Examine how, in different ways, the lives of these men and women shed light on the world in which they lived. The course begins in the 12th century with the martyr Thomas Becket and ends in the 15th century with Margaret Beaufort, who persevered through the Wars of the Roses to become a patroness of art and letters, as well as matriarch of the Tudor dynasty. Learn about complex figures from the intervening centuries, including Alice Perrers who compromised the reputation of King Edward III; King Henry V, hero of Agincourt; and also study King John, whose reign led to the issuing of the Magna Carta in 1215, exactly eight hundred years ago.           Week Two: Tudor People: The Famous and the Infamous  July 26\u2013August 1, 2015  Tutor: Tracey Sowerby, Ph.D.     Study the lives, achievements, and exploits of important Tudor men and women whose reputations--whether tyrannical, heroic, or romantic--captured the imagination of the people of 16th century England. This seminar covers such notable figures as young King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, who acceded to the throne in 1547, Queen Mary, half-sister of Elizabeth I, who later in her reign was maligned as an enemy. Examine the lives of Charles Brandon, a famous military hero and the brother-in-law of Henry VIII; Sir Francis Drake, the famous explorer and naval champion; and Richard III, who although defeated and killed in battle in 1485, became synonymous in the Tudor era with medieval infamy and tyranny.

Academics        Week One: England's Medieval Heroes and Villains  July 19\u201325, 2015  Tutor: Elizabeth Gemmill, Ph.D.   Medieval England is rich in the tapestry of heroes and villains. Examine how, in different ways, the lives of these men and women shed light on the world in which they lived. The course begins in the 12th century with the martyr Thomas Becket and ends in the 15th century with Margaret Beaufort, who persevered through the Wars of the Roses to become a patroness of art and letters, as well as matriarch of the Tudor dynasty. Learn about complex figures from the intervening centuries, including Alice Perrers who compromised the reputation of King Edward III; King Henry V, hero of Agincourt; and also study King John, whose reign led to the issuing of the Magna Carta in 1215, exactly eight hundred years ago.           Week Two: Tudor People: The Famous and the Infamous  July 26\u2013August 1, 2015  Tutor: Tracey Sowerby, Ph.D.     Study the lives, achievements, and exploits of important Tudor men and women whose reputations--whether tyrannical, heroic, or romantic--captured the imagination of the people of 16th century England. This seminar covers such notable figures as young King Edward VI, son of Henry VIII, who acceded to the throne in 1547, Queen Mary, half-sister of Elizabeth I, who later in her reign was maligned as an enemy. Examine the lives of Charles Brandon, a famous military hero and the brother-in-law of Henry VIII; Sir Francis Drake, the famous explorer and naval champion; and Richard III, who although defeated and killed in battle in 1485, became synonymous in the Tudor era with medieval infamy and tyranny.

When proficient, they play in a viol ensemble. The FAS Department lends students a viol and bow from its collection. Qualified students may play with The Teares of the Muses, an ensemble affiliated with the NYU Music Department. The group performs on- and off-campus. Requirements to enroll in the course are previous vocal or instrumental training on any instrument - not limited to strings - and good musicianship skills.  Irish in America, 1750 to the Present - MUSIC-GA 1319 Tuesday 3:30 - 6:00 (TBA) Instructor: Daniel Neely This course surveys the musical culture of Irish emigrants to North America from 1750 to the present. It seeks to set musical styles in Ireland and America in an informed historical dialogue, thereby opening up explanatory paradigms for Irish diasporic experience and for the role of Irish music in North American social, cultural, and political life. Students will gain a detailed groundwork for subsequent historical research in folk and popular culture. The course will also be of use to students of comparative music history, the history and theory of popular culture, and the study of memory and folklore.             Techniques of Music Composition - MUSIC-GA 2162 Tuesday 10:30 - 12:30 (Waverly 365) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman (section 001); Louis Karchin (section 002) This semester's topic: \"The Contemporary Operatic Voice: A Spectrum of Issues and Works\" * Please note that each professor will cap enrollment for individual composition lessons at 4 students each. This does not mean that others cannot enroll in the course. Contact the department or instructor(s) in order to get permission to enroll. Special Studies: Czech Music - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 001) Wednesday 3:00-5:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Michael Beckerman This seminar both studies and interrogates the idea of Czech music focusing on historical continuities, case studies, micro-histories and the exploration of musical style and meaning. Subjects studied will include 16th and 17th century music in the Czech Lands, Czech language punk and hip hop, romantic nationalism in Bohemia and Moravia, Czechness and folklore under Communism, the question of \"Czechoslovak Music,\" the role of Roma in \"Czech\" culture, and the relationship between gender and form in national music. Czech language not required.  Special Studies: On Mimesis - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 002) Thursday 2:00-4:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Jamie Currie Mimesis, broadly conceived, is a central category for thinking about the arts. This seminar will seek to investigate some of the complexities of this notion by means of close study of three operas (Monteverdi's Orfeo , Mozart's Don Giovanni , and Puccini's Gianni Schichi ) alongside a survey of some theoretically and philosophically relevant literature, drawn from (amongst others) Derrida, Lacan, Taussig, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Fanon, Bhaba, Marx, Bersani and Copjec. That is the simple answer to the question: what is this seminar about? A more loaded justification for this course would run something as follows. Over the course of the past quarter of a century, terms such as absolute music, aesthetic autonomy, originality, genius, and the values accompanying them, have been vigorously flushed out of the discursive systems of Anglo-American academic music studies. The detox has been successful. There is no longer any need to boo anyone off stage for speaking uncritically about such things, since nobody now speaks about them at all. As a result, we simply assume the following kinds of things: that the individual is a social construct; that music is born out of its historical contexts; that composers are motivated (knowingly or not) by political ideologies; that performances are expressions of the forces that have engendered us; that there is no outside to history or society or the \"relational\"; and so on and so forth. Once uniqueness has been supposedly unmasked as but another social construct (...or a product of its historical context, or a tool for the work of ideology, or but an unacknowledged expression of the very world it claims to transcend, or...) then we find ourselves caught in a situation where the mimetic (broadly conceived) runs rampant. It is almost impossible for the pervasively cultural turn of so much contemporary academic music studies to avoid talking about how musicking represents aspects of the world, or mimics other musics, or echoes events elsewhere, or mirrors contemporary politics, or reflects issues of gender, or imagines (and thus makes images of) racial communities , or resonates with anxieties concerning the environment, and so on and so forth. Within the sublime mimesis of the worlds in which we now live, if there is one thing, then there is also a trace of it left elsewhere. Indeed, our endless dull documentation of all-and-everything by means of our smart phones and the like is but one example of how the mimetic impulse has penetrated so deep as to be now but a surface physical tick that the body performs unthinkingly in relationship to whatever it is it encounters. This being the case, then \"this\" needs to be thought through: we need to become strategically virtuosic knowing when, where, and how the mimetic can politically function for the right ends, and when it is but an invitation to unproductive incarceration. Of course, scholars in media studies have been thinking and theorizing about such things for a long time. But whilst participants in this seminar will be free to pursue that literature for the purposes of their final presentations and papers (and indeed shall be encouraged to do so should such writings light some productive fires) the focus of the seminar meetings themselves will be to approach this mimetic impulse from a more oblique angle: through case studies of operatic works that are mimetically overloaded (at present, Monteverdi's Orfeo , Mozart's Don Giovanni , and Puccini's Gianni Schichi ), and a body of theoretical and fictional literature that, whilst of import to investigations in media studies, is not necessarily media studies per se. This, in tandem with the more recognizable musicological pursuit of thinking about opera, we will also be reading, amongst other things: selections from Ovid's Metamorphosis , Derrida on Echo and Narcissus, Lacan on the mirror stage, Homi Bhaba on mimicry, Fanon on masks, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, Joan Copjec and Leo Bersani on Marcissism, Benjamin and Adorno on reproduction, Marx on the commodity form, and (over the course of the semester) the whole of Michael Taussig's magnificent Mimesis and Alterity: A Particular History of the Senses.  Special Studies: Islam and Christianity in the Global South - A Musical Geography - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 001) Tuesday 3:00-5:00 (Waverly 268) Instructor: Christine Dang This course explores musical performance in relation to one of the most salient demographic trends of the last century and a half; the explosive growth of Islam and Christianity, most strikingly in regions of the global south - in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Drawing on literature from sociology, anthropology, and ethnomusicology, we probe the varied forms of musical expression that have emerged with the southern migration of Islam and Christianity. We examine the adaptation of canonic practices - such as Islamic recitation and hymns in four-part harmony - as they travel from their storied Middle Eastern and European origins to different geographies and cultures, as they fuse with indigenous sounds and beliefs, and as they inspire new and deeply localized modes of devotion. In musically mapping Islam and Christianity, we contemplate issues such as syncretism, indigeneity, and spiritual hybridity; social constructions of the sacred and profane, and the acoustically fertile spaces in between; the relationship between voice, language, and text in claiming religious authenticity; the sonic demarcation of spiritual centers and peripheries; the role of the slave trade, colonialism, and globalization in the development of Islamic and Christian musical communities; the politics of religious belonging; and the contested place of religious culture in postcolonial and secular regimes. Our leading goal is to bring musical developments within the world's two largest religions into conversation with each other and with broad perspectives on the changing cultural geographies of the global south. This seminar will be useful to students interested in music and spirituality, the anthropology of belief, religious studies, and the cultural dimensions of global south studies. No prior musical background is necessary. Special Studies: New Media Creation Workshop - Gesture, Sound, and Image Interactions - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 002) Monday 3:00-5:00 (Location:TBA) Instructor: Jaime Oliver In this course we will develop interactive artwork that explores the relationships between sound, image, and gesture through the inspection of historical and contemporary works, and relevant subjects in new media theory, cognitive science, and interactive architecture and behavior design. Artwork in this case means music/computer music (interactive/generative systems, musical instrument design, visual music) and sound art practices (sound sculpture, sound installation, sound objects). The course will combine weekly lectures and additional meetings for workshops and critique will be scheduled as necessary. Topics may include the use of video analysis as a sensor/sound analysis and feature extraction/generating and editing visual material from sound signals/topics in physical computing (Pd/RaspberryPi)/intermodal cognition/Pixel, OpenGL, and Shader manipulation/data sonification/alternative/graphic scores. These topics may vary according to the specific needs of student projects. Examples will be provided in Pure Data, Gem, RaspberryPi, (and C/C++ whenever necessary). This course will run in parallel with the implementation of the studio and workshop spaces in the department, which will be complemented by guest workshops. Students are expected to take advantage of these workshops and facilities.  Special Studies: Listening - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 003) *Enrollment capped at 10 Music students Tuesday 9:30-12:15 (721 Broadway, 6th Floor, Room 613) Instructors: Martin Daughtry and Deborah Kapchan The philosophy and social theory of the 20th century engaged the body and its senses in unprecedented ways. And yet the body remained largely silent until the end of the century, when inquiry turned toward two topics: sound and affect. The co-emergence of these literatures is not pure coincidence: sound and affect re-write the body in similar ways. Both highlight ambiguity and fluidity, characteristics of what Steven Connor (2004) calls \"immaterial corporeality.\" Both infiltrate, impact, and exceed the body, revealing it as a permeable zone, a receptive site emplaced within an intersubjective environment that is always already vibrating. Within the rich and growing body of scholarship on sound and affect, we (Deborah and Martin) have each been exploring, in complementary ways, the act of listening. We understand listening to be, minimally: a physiological process,a performative practice, an acoustemological act (i.e. a sound-centered act through which the world is known), a moment of affective capture, and moment of temporary surrender - both to sounds and to the powers that course through them. Our recent explorations of \"literacies of listening\" (Kapchan, 2009) and \"listening acts\" (Kapchan 2015, in press) within Sufi communities, as well as \"(in)audition\" and \"auditory regimes\" within the context of the Iraq war (Daughtry 2012 and in press) have led us to the common set of questions and approaches regarding listening that form the basis for this course. Indeed, listening has taken on a great deal of responsibility of late. In the context of the rise of religiosities, it is cited as the first step in the processes of conversion (Harding 2000:59). It makes the subject vulnerable to an interlocutor, opening a space of inter-subjectivity and empathic religious response (Fryholm 2004: 10-11). Listening renders the self porous to other aesthetic and often spiritual influences (Luhrmann 2012; Taylor 2010). Further, it reforms the acoustic unconscious, creating new religious sensibilities (Hirschkind 2006; Kapchan 2010). Listening also has its role in non-religious world makings. It is foundational in the first awareness of self as sound (Nancy 2007). Through echolocation, listening situates the body within a physical environment and in relation to other sonic agents that populate it. And just as it is forms the self, listening can also deform it or effect its disintegration, sometimes violently (Daughtry in press). Listening, that is, can be instrumentalized to create community, or to dissolve it. Our ears (and skin, and the other corporeal zones that are invigorated by sound) are constant consumers, yet listening challenges the property principle (Kapchan in press). How can we own a vibration, a sound? Together with you we will spend this semester exploring the dynamics, affordances, and limits of listening, focusing for only on theoretical works, but on \"sound knowledge\": the affective transmission that occurs through actual listening acts. To that end, we will begin each class with a structured listening act that performs the knowledge we will then theorize. We will listen in this sense with theories of listening and practices of listening - but we will do our best to blur the distinction between the two. Requirements: Each week will explore a different genre of listening from multiple text- and sense-based perspectives. Students should be willing to engage intellectually and bodily in the seminar. We expect a thoughtful and original paper as well as a sound walk, installation, or other form of documentation of a situated listening practice. Each week, students will write astute commentary that engages with the assigned readings and/or listenings, and post these comments on NYU Classes. Attendance and active participation are mandatory.                                      Sitemap       |       Contact us       |       &copy; New York University, Arts and Science"}]}]
