In an era when the demolition of older  buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric but also  as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and  using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable --and profitable. This program explores innovative ways to  reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental  protection by recycling existing structures. The course of study combines academic training and research  with experiential learning opportunities, and the program  operates within the framework of New York University\u2019s London program.          British  architects, designers, builders and developers are leaders in the field of  adaptive reuse and sustainable architecture. For this reason, the program is based in London, where our  faculty consists of the city\u2019s innovative architects and designers. Working under restrictive historic  protection orders, these designers have successfully reused both important and modest  older buildings, adapting them to new uses and integrating them into new  projects built around, over, and even under historic structures. Our students will have the rare  opportunity to study with these leading practitioners .              We welcome a  diverse student body, including recent American college graduates and young  professionals, as well as applicants from other nations. Program graduates will put their training  to practical use throughout the world.   As demand grows for reuse rather than new construction, our students  will help contribute new solutions to the challenges of contemporary urban  planning and real estate development. Graduates will shape the urban environment as architects, city  planners, public administrators, non-profit advocates, public and private  consultants, and real estate developers.      The  curriculum also proposes to extend sustainable practices beyond architecture  and building into the realm of urban design. Students will examine successful strategies for reviving  entire districts, cities, and regions around repurposed historic buildings in  areas as diverse as the London Docklands, the Puerto Madero neighborhood in  Buenos Aires, and the older industrial regions of Germany. These examples suggest new  possibilities for post-industrial, \u201cRust Belt\u201d cities in the U.S., such as Buffalo  and Cleveland, where the numerous historic buildings provide resources to be  adapted for new uses, not liabilities to be demolished.          The M.A. in  Historical and Sustainable Architecture is the first academic program to unite  the topics of sustainable architecture, adaptive reuse, and historic  preservation within a single curriculum.   Combining the multiple perspectives of finance, environmentalism,  education, tourism, and government policy, this program will explore older  buildings as assets, not hindrances, to real estate development. Sponsored by the Urban Design and  Architecture Studies program of the Art History Department at New York University,  the M.A. program in Historical and Sustainable Architecture will benefit from the  New York program\u2019s tradition of interdisciplinary analysis and its broad,  humanistic perspective on urban design.             We accept applications on a rolling basis, with a target deadline of March 1 for matriculation in the fall semester of each year. Please  contact histsust@nyu.edu for further  information about the program and the application process."}]},

In an era when the demolition of older  buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric but also  as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and  using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable --and profitable. This program explores innovative ways to  reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental  protection by recycling existing structures. The course of study combines academic training and research  with experiential learning opportunities, and the program  operates within the framework of New York University\u2019s London program.          British  architects, designers, builders and developers are leaders in the field of  adaptive reuse and sustainable architecture. For this reason, the program is based in London, where our  faculty consists of the city\u2019s innovative architects and designers. Working under restrictive historic  protection orders, these designers have successfully reused both important and modest  older buildings, adapting them to new uses and integrating them into new  projects built around, over, and even under historic structures. Our students will have the rare  opportunity to study with these leading practitioners .              We welcome a  diverse student body, including recent American college graduates and young  professionals, as well as applicants from other nations. Program graduates will put their training  to practical use throughout the world.   As demand grows for reuse rather than new construction, our students  will help contribute new solutions to the challenges of contemporary urban  planning and real estate development. Graduates will shape the urban environment as architects, city  planners, public administrators, non-profit advocates, public and private  consultants, and real estate developers.      The  curriculum also proposes to extend sustainable practices beyond architecture  and building into the realm of urban design. Students will examine successful strategies for reviving  entire districts, cities, and regions around repurposed historic buildings in  areas as diverse as the London Docklands, the Puerto Madero neighborhood in  Buenos Aires, and the older industrial regions of Germany. These examples suggest new  possibilities for post-industrial, \u201cRust Belt\u201d cities in the U.S., such as Buffalo  and Cleveland, where the numerous historic buildings provide resources to be  adapted for new uses, not liabilities to be demolished.          The M.A. in  Historical and Sustainable Architecture is the first academic program to unite  the topics of sustainable architecture, adaptive reuse, and historic  preservation within a single curriculum.   Combining the multiple perspectives of finance, environmentalism,  education, tourism, and government policy, this program will explore older  buildings as assets, not hindrances, to real estate development. Sponsored by the Urban Design and  Architecture Studies program of the Art History Department at New York University,  the M.A. program in Historical and Sustainable Architecture will benefit from the  New York program\u2019s tradition of interdisciplinary analysis and its broad,  humanistic perspective on urban design.             We accept applications on a rolling basis, with a target deadline of March 1 for matriculation in the fall semester of each year.

Under the Historical and Sustainable Architecture program, offered in conjunction with London\u2019s Sir John Soane Museum, students will study with British architects, designers, builders, and developers, who are leaders in the field of adaptive reuse and sustainable architecture.       \u201cIn an era when the demolition of older buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric, but also as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable,\u201d said Program Director Mosette Broderick, a clinical associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Art History and director of its Urban Design program. \u201cThis program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures.\u201d     In September, the first group of students will arrive in London for an academic year studying methods to effect the adaptive re-use of older buildings. The nine-month program will concentrate on solutions in the United Kingdom, which graduates will be able to translate to their home countries.       \u201cThe program relies on professionals who have successfully reused both important and modest older buildings, adapting them to new uses and integrating them into new projects built around, over, and even under historic structures,\u201d Broderick added. \u201cOur students will have the rare opportunity to study with these leading practitioners.\u201d       The curriculum extends sustainable practices beyond architecture and building into the realm of urban design. Students will examine successful strategies for reviving entire districts, cities, and regions around repurposed historic buildings in areas as diverse as the London Docklands and the older industrial regions of Germany.           \u201cThese examples suggest new possibilities for post-industrial, Rust Belt cities in the U.S., such as Buffalo and Cleveland, where the numerous historic buildings provide resources to be adapted for new uses, not liabilities to be demolished,\u201d Broderick observed.
