This workshop focuses on creating mixed media art inspired by and created for New York City. Over the course of the session, students study the \"cultural economy\" of the city, through an in depth examination of current New York based photographers, filmmakers, and installation artists. Students will then create four unique pieces of their own, inspired by these artists and energized by the social nature of the city. These pieces take the form of photography, audio art, documentary video, and site-specific public installation. Class time is devoted to lectures, guest speakers, field trips and critique. Basic video and audio editing will be covered in lab sessions. Readings include \"The Warhol Economy\" by Elizabeth Currid, \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities\" by Jane Jacobs, and \"Take the F\" by Ian Frazier.
