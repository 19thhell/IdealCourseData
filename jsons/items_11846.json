Our approach will be grounded in theories, methods, and texts of communication and media studies, thus it will serve as a complement to other queer theory and culture courses offered across the university. Readings will include both theoretical texts and case studies both historical and contemporary. Students will complete the course with a critical understanding of what it means to be and &ldquo;do&rdquo; queer in contemporary culture. Students will also be equipped to bring queer analytical tools to their everyday and professional encounters with popular culture.

Our approach will be grounded in theories, methods, and texts of communication and media studies, thus it will serve as a complement to other queer theory and culture courses offered across the university. Readings will include both theoretical texts and case studies both historical and contemporary. Students will complete the course with a critical understanding of what it means to be and &ldquo;do&rdquo; queer in contemporary culture. Students will also be equipped to bring queer analytical tools to their everyday and professional encounters with popular culture.

If you have taken Intercultural Communication you should not take this course. This course examines globalization as it is inscribed in everyday practices through the transnational traffic of persons, cultural artifacts, and ideas. The course will focus on issues of transnational mobility, modernity, the local/global divide, and pay specific attention to how categories of race, gender, and ethnicity intersect with transnational change.
