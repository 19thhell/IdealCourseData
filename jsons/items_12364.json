Office Address:   Puck Building, Room 4144, 295 Lafayette Street New York, NY 10012   Office Hours:   By Appointment   Email:     manza@nyu.edu     Phone:   (212) 998-8935         Areas of Research/Interest:   Social inequality, political sociology, and public policy.     Research Description:   Jeff Manza (Ph.D University of California \u2013 Berkeley, 1995) is Professor of Sociology, and the former Chair (2009-12) of the Department of Sociology at New York University. Before coming to NYU, he taught at Penn State (1996-98) and Northwestern (1998-2007). His teaching and research interests lay at the intersection of inequality, political sociology, and public policy. His research has examined how different types of social identities and inequalities influence political processes such as voting behavior, partisanship, and public opinion (at both the macro and micro level). In collaboration with Christopher Uggen, he has been involved in a long-term project that has examined the causes and consequences of felon disenfranchisement in the United States; their book Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy (Oxford University Press 2006) is the standard work on the topic. Manza is the co-author of three books with Clem Brooks (of Indiana University): Social Cleavages and Political Change (Oxford University Press, 1999), a study of the changing social demography of the American electorate and its partisan consequences; an analysis of the comparative impact of public opinion on welfare state effort in the OECD democracies entitled Why Welfare States Persist (University of Chicago Press, 2007); and most recently Whose Rights?: Counterterrorism and the Dark Side of American Public Opinion (Russell Sage Foundation Press, 2013), an examination of the sources and persistence of public support for harsh counterterrorism policies that highlights the role of American national identity in shaping individual attitudes. In addition to his books, Manza\u2019s work has appeared in numerous scientific journals in several disciplines, including the American Sociological Review , the American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, Sociological Theory, Public Opinion Quarterly, and the Journal of Politics , as well as newspapers and general interest magazines. He is currently completing a book (with Clem Brooks) that interrogates the surprisingly limited impact of rising inequality on the attitudes and policy preferences of Americans, and they are also working on a series of papers drawing from survey experiments they designed and implemented to better understand the role of national identity in shaping attitudes towards racial and ethnic outgroups.       In addition to scholarship and teaching, Manza has served in a variety of administrative posts. Before coming to NYU, he served as the Associate Director and Acting Director of the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, a major social science and policy research center at that institution. At NYU, he chaired the Department of Sociology from 2009 to 2012. During this time, he helped make a number of major faculty appointments, created a new MA program in Applied Quantitative Research (which will begin in the fall of 2013), and led the Department through an extensive curricular reform of the graduate program after a review of the best practices elsewhere. His most ambitious administrative project to date, however, was to launch The Sociology Project: An Introduction to the Sociological Imagination (Pearson 2012), and The Sociology Project 2.0 (Pearson 2015), a unique joint venture of the Department which seeks to develop a new model for the introductory textbook, with individual chapters authored by a faculty member who teaches and writes on that topic. The book is also unique in that profits will be reinvested in the graduate and undergraduate sociology programs at NYU.

The Law and Society minor offers undergraduates a useful and meaningful cluster of courses in this area. Administered through the Department of Sociology, the minor is interdisciplinary in nature. It consists of five courses: one required \u201ccore\u201d course (Law and Society) and four electives. The electives can be taken from a list of approved courses across a range of disciplines. This allows the minor to be both substantial and coherent in its focus. The minor also provides students the opportunity to pursue advanced and specialized work through independent study projects as well as access to graduate classes (with permission of faculty). While prelaw students are welcome to take these classes, the minor is not aimed specifically at them. A list of courses that count toward the Law and Society minor is available every semester through the Sociology Department. Contact Jamie Lloyd ( jamie.lloyd@nyu.edu ) or Professor Lynne Haney ( lynne.haney@nyu.edu ) for a copy of this list or with questions about the minor. To declare a Law &amp; Society minor complete the Declaration of Minor Form .This   form should be mailed or dropped off to Jamie Lloyd at the NYU Department of   Sociology, Puck Building, 295 Lafayette Street, room 4168. Requirements for the Minor The minor in Law and Society consists of five 4-point courses (20 points). The requirements are as follows: One core course, chosen from: Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1 001), cross-listed with Politics (POL-UA 335) Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1 002), cross-listed with Sociology (SOC-UA 413 One course in Research Methods (SOC-UA 301 or another methods course with approval of Law and Society director) Three elective courses. Students can also petition the Director to have additional courses count toward the elective requirement. Note: Courses applied to this minor cannot be double-counted toward a major or another minor. The pass/fail option is not acceptable for the law and society minor. Students who declared a minor in Law and Society prior to Fall 2013 are not required to take Research Methods; they may take a fourth elective instead. Students who are majoring in Sociology, and who are taking Research Methods to fulfill their major requirement, can take a fourth elective instead. Independent Study Independent Study is an opportunity for students to work closely with a faculty advisor on a project related to their area of study. Students must choose a member of the faculty. After securing written approval from a faculty member, the student should contact the Undergraduate Administrator, in order to register for the independent study course. The proposal will be reviewed by the program Director for approval. It is imperative that students meet with their faculty advisor on a regular basis throughout the semester in which they are doing the independent study. Upon completion of the \"course\", written proof from the student's faculty advisor that the student has completed all course work for study and a grade must be sent to the Undergraduate Administrator.
