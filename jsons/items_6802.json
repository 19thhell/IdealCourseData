Pragmatism, like classical political theory, is concerned with politics as a way of achieving the good life rather than viewing politics narrowly in terms of elections and governments. Through texts by and about the Pragmatists, especially Dewey, the course will introduce theories and practices of participatory democracy, economic democracy, civic journalism, progressive education, participatory action research, and conflict resolution. Reading Pragmatism as philosophy, in the Hegelian tradition, we will address many of the questions pursued by Marx, Nietzsche, and the postmodernists, and will uncover rich alternative answers.

His teaching interests are primarily in democratic theory, ethics, and democracy and education. He also teaches peace Studies, conflict resolution, political psychology, and philosophy of science. Caspary's activism in the peace movement during the 1960s led him to change his academic focus from physics to political science, but his physics background led to an ongoing interest in philosophy of science and philosophy of social science. Prior to coming to Gallatin, he taught political theory for 30 years at Washington University in St. Louis. In addition to his teaching and political action, he has worked as an educational consultant, ombudsman, and mediator. Caspary's recent scholarship focused on the pragmatist tradition in American thought, especially the democratic and ethical theories of John Dewey. He is the author of Dewey on Democracy (Cornell University Press, 2000) and numerous articles in scholarly journals. His current scholarly work is on the history of ethical philosophy, with an emphasis on the ethics of dissent. The American Political Science Association gave him a Distinguished Career Award in 2002.                News       Professor Bill Caspary delivered his paper: &quot;Agonism, Meliorism, and Conflict Resolution in the Political Theory of William James\u201d at the Association for Political Theory Annual Meeting, Madison Wisconsin, October 18, 2014. Professor Caspary presented \u201cThe Struggle for Fundamental Change,\u201d at the April 2014 University Seminar on Innovation in Education, held at Columbia University. For the Northeast Political Science Association\u2019s annual meeting, held in Philadelphia, PA, in November 2013, he read \u201cContempt and Envy in Political Theory.\u201d He participated in the Meta-Ethics Seminar at the October 2013 Association for Political Theory, held at Vanderbilt University.                           top of page                                     Contact Information     Bill Caspary             Part-time Faculty              Caspary@aol.com             1 Wash Pl, Room 613             (212) 998-7340      Download as vCard           \u00a0           Office Hours             Tuesday 3-4:45                                                           Courses                                                   2015             Spring                            Ethics for Dissenters                  Wed      3:30 PM -      6:10 PM                                                   2015             Fall                            Creative Democracy: The Pragmatist Tradition                  Wed      3:30 PM -      6:10 PM                                                   2014             Spring                            Ethics for Dissenters                  Wed      3:30 PM -      6:10 PM                                                   2014             Fall                            Creative Democracy: The Pragmatist Tradition                  Wed      3:30 PM -      6:10 PM                                                   2013             Spring                            Ethics for Dissenters                  Wed      3:30 PM -      6:10 PM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       social and political thought; democratic theory; education theory and practice; political psychology - including humanistic and psychoanalytic psychology; philosophy of ethics; philosophy of science; peace studies, including conflict resolution                                                                                                              NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
