The appointment, which begins immediately, is for 2010/11 academic year and supports and enhances the emphasis the Recorded Music Department places on teaching students the skills of creative entrepreneurship for the music industry.       \u201cSwizz Beatz\u2019 amazing track record as an artist and producer, coupled with his commitment to education, makes him the ideal role model for our students,\u201d said Jeffrey Rabhan, chair, The Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music. \u201cWe consider it a great honor to have him involved with this unique program.\u201d     \"I\u2019m excited to be able to take my many years of experience in the music business and use it as an example to instruct students,\u201d remarked Swizz Beatz. \u201cThe invitation from Mr. Davis and Professor Rabhan is humbling and I\u2019m honored.\"     The Producer-in-Residence provides students with direct access to one of the music industry\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs, filling the Department\u2019s experiential education mandate. In this role, the Producer-in-Residence will guide students through a variety of portals, including one-on-one sessions, group lectures, songwriting critiques, and mentoring.       As a music producer, Swizz has created hits for a long list of music legends, including Beyonce, Lil Wayne, Metallica, and Jay-Z. They seek him for his signature sound: brash instrumentals and futuristic beats layered with what\u2019s become his sound mark\u2014clever, catchy sound-over\u2019s on a track. From Beyonce\u2019s, Ring the Alarm to Limp Bizkit\u2019s Rollin\u2019 , nearly every song he\u2019s touched has turned to gold, platinum or diamond.

Currently he\u2019s in the recording studio working on a new album while pursuing other entrepreneurial projects.   The innovative artist\u2019s philanthropy includes adopting the Bronx Charter School for the Arts, located in the Hunts Point neighborhood. It was founded by an entrepreneurial group of parents and educators to encourage creativity within its students. Early this year, Swizz helped raise funds to be used for supplies and outings for the children.   Swizz (Kasseem Dean) was born and raised in the South Bronx where he grew up in a family immersed in contemporary music. His father, Terrence Dean, is the founder of Terrence Dean Entertainment Management, and Swizz\u2019s uncles started Ruff Ryders Records, where Swizz, at 16, began using his talents to produce tracks. The label\u2019s first chart breaking hit, DMX\u2019s Stop, Drop , was one of Swizz\u2019s productions. And in 2001 at the age of 23, the talented Swizz founded his own record label, Full Surface Records, a joint venture with Clive Davis of J Records.
