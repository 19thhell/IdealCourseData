students to approach engineering in an integrated manner that cuts across traditional boundaries of the profession and practice. The program provides a balance between breadth across the traditional engineering disciplines and depth in a thematic multi-disciplinary area. The three thematic areas currently emphasized correspond to the research themes of the division, i.e., Information, Communication, Electronic Systems (ICE); Urban Systems; and BioMedical and Health Systems.   Students are expected to choose a specialization in one of the three thematic areas. The engineering courses in the program related to the specialization consist of some required courses that explore the broad interdisciplinary basis of the area, followed by electives that provide depth in an aspect of the specialization.

These digital communication tools range from traditional e-mail services to robust interactive websites.   Outside of direct web and online support for the primary academic mission of the university, digital communication and collaboration can be critical to indirectly supporting the NYU community's intellectual growth. Two groups strive to deliver high-quality solutions and guidance for Web Services, Mobile and Social Media: the Office of Web Communications (WebComm) and Information Technology Services ' eServices Group (ITS).   Acting as one unit to serve the university's non-academic needs, these two groups have formed the Digital Communications Group (DigiComm) to collaborate with university offices and provide tools to develop and maintain digital outlets while ensuring that the university\u2019s visual identity standards and best practices are met.   If you are looking to update, refresh or redesign your web presence, need help using the Content Management System , or want to send a customized HTML E-mail , DigiComm can help.

students to approach engineering in an integrated manner that cuts across traditional boundaries of the profession and practice. The program provides a balance between breadth across the traditional engineering disciplines and depth in a thematic multi-disciplinary area. The three thematic areas currently emphasized correspond to the research themes of the division, i.e., Information, Communication, Electronic Systems (ICE); Urban Systems; and BioMedical and Health Systems.   Students are expected to choose a specialization in one of the three thematic areas. The engineering courses in the program related to the specialization consist of some required courses that explore the broad interdisciplinary basis of the area, followed by electives that provide depth in an aspect of the specialization.

broad interdisciplinary areas that embody key characteristics of our age. The faculty are involved in new and emerging technological fields, such as bioengineering, nanotechnology, microfabrication, smart materials, and cyber security. Their research is built around the three thematic research areas discussed below.                               Biomedical and Health Systems   Biomedical and Health Systems concerns the science of health and wellness to unlock the mysteries of disease and genetic maladies and the engineering technology that is the bridge to deliver healthcare to people. The engineering aspects of this vast field of study include the interfacing of engineered systems with biological and anatomical systems; the measurement of physiological parameters; bio-sensing and detection of disease, disease agents, and impending failures; imaging; delivery of targeted therapeutics; and others. The use of computational techniques in organizing and interpreting the great volume of data being collected worldwide, including genetic information, and algorithms to predict disease markers and therapeutic molecules is a new and powerful technological advance in this field. Biomaterials, bio-compatible materials and bioresorbable materials, micro-biodevices, and use of wireless and computer technologies in patient care round out some of the multidisciplinary areas that draw from several different traditional engineering disciplines.                               Information, Communication, and Electronic Systems (ICE)     Information, Communication, and Electronic Systems (ICE) concerns electronic hardware and software technologies of the global information economy. These technologies are the enablers of social and economic change, and provide the tools to manage such change and institutional complexity in a digital environment. Systems that use electronic and computational hardware and software permeate every sphere of human life and are at the core of every modern engineered system. This exciting area includes the design of circuits, chips, and devices; integration and interfacing of component building blocks into large systems and networks; and development of data management and manipulation algorithms, database systems, communication protocols, computer architecture, signal processing, and the like. Applications such as network security, information and cyber security, telecommunications, automation, measurement and actuation, digital control, and digital robotic systems are also considered in the set of offerings in the curriculum.                             Urban Systems   Urban Systems concerns the technological challenges and innovations for the smooth functioning and sustaining of urban centers. Earth is increasingly becoming an urban planet; for the first time in history, more than 50 percent of the world's population now lives in cities. The challenges associated with a sustainable, engaging, and harmonious urban environment require a multidisciplinary approach that integrates various technologies and disciplines. The program examines urban infrastructure design, monitoring, and management; smart materials; power systems; energy efficiency; transportation planning and management; security and safety; telecommunications; resource usage and recycling; supply chains; environmental engineering; and other engineered systems that have an impact on urban living.
