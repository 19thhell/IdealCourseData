We aim not just to convey knowledge but to produce it and to teach others how to learn throughout their lives.     Through the generosity of parents, alumni, and friends of the College, an endowed Fund provides grants to assist a student's own research, whether to help with the gathering of data and information, or in the presentation of the results at an academic conference. Selection by a faculty committee is competitive. Since 1996 over 1,000 students have been awarded close to a million dollars in research scholarships. Students apply to the College; forms and instructions are available online. Please click here .

Consider applying for one of the following:      Robert A. Fowkes Research Scholarship \u2014 an award to a student doing research on European culture (or at a European NYU academic center)      Arthur Frommer Research Scholarship for Travel and Global Studies \u2014 an award to a student doing research in the field of international travel, or doing some kind of research involving multidisciplinary international study at a Global NYU Center      June Schlesinger Katz International Research Scholarship \u2014 an award for research on a foreign culture or nation (a wide number of projects can fit this description)      S.

Mayank and Amita Patel Research Scholarship \u2014 an award given to a student doing research on South Asian culture, with a focus on religious studies      Herman J. Wechsler Award for Study and Travel in the Fine Arts \u2014 for a student who is researching European fine art or art history and will study or has studies at one of NYU's European academic site      Virtual Arboretum Project \u2014 The Collaborate Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund Award   The Virtual Arboretum Project's goal is to nurture the cross-disciplinary work so many of our students undertake. To make a long-lasting and ongoing contribution to NYU's Global Network, CAS students can apply for funds to work with a team of peers from other departments within CAS, or from other schools within the university, to capture data, images, and information about the green spaces \u2014 particularly the trees, plantings, and other flora \u2014 on the various NYU campuses and academic centers. Students interested in photography, computer programming, horticulture, environmental sustainability, urban design, writing, and other areas can come together to create a living online document that will highlight the ways our campuses interact with the natural world. The possibilities for collaboration, and for building a web-based document and archive, are endless.     Interested students should make an appointment with the Assistant Dean for Students for support in drafting a proposal, finding collaborators and/or mentors, and working with NYU's Global Information Technology Services.
