Introduction  to Cinema Studies    CINE-UT  10 First  semester of study. Allen. 4 points.    Designed  to introduce the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies to new majors.  The first goal is to help students develop a range of analytical skills in the  study of film. By the end of the semester, they are fluent in the basic  vocabulary of film form, understand the social questions raised by dominant  modes of cinematic representation, and grasp the mechanics of structuring a  written argument about a film's meaning. The second goal is to familiarize  students with some of the major critical approaches in the field (for example,  narrative theory, feminism, cultural studies, and genre). To this end, readings  and screenings also provide a brief introduction to some critical issues  associated with particular modes of film production and criticism (such as  documentary, narrative, and the avant-garde).          Film  History: Silent Cinema    CINE-UT  15 Second  semester of study. Dibbern. 4 points.    Examines  how the history of cinema has been studied and written by taking the period of  silent film as its case study. Explores the historical and cultural contexts  that governed the emergence of film as art and mass culture. Investigates the  different approaches to narrative filmmaking that developed internationally in  the silent period. Screenings include early cinema, works of Hollywood drama  and comedy, Russian film and Soviet montage cinema, Weimar cinema, and silent  black cinema.          Film  Theory    CINE-UT  16 Third  semester of study. Straayer. 4 points.    Closely  examines a variety of theoretical writings concerned with aesthetic, social,  and psychological aspects of the medium. Students study the writing of classical  theorists such as Eisenstein, Bazin, and Kracauer, as well as such contemporary  thinkers as Metz, Mulvey, and Baudrillard. Questions addressed range from the  nature of cinematic representation and its relationship to other forms of  cultural expression to the way in which cinema shapes our conception of racial  and gender identity.          Television:  History and Culture    CINE-UT  21   Fourth semester of study. McCarthy. 4 points.    Examines  the background, context, and history of radio, television, video, and sound.  Topics include politics and economics of media institutions, audiences and  reception, cultural and broadcast policy, and aesthetic modes and movements.
