Refunds are automatically generated the beginning the fifth week of classes, unless otherwise noted. You may request for your refund before the fifth week of classes by contacting the Bursar's office at (212) 998-2806 or by email bursar.refunds@nyu.edu .       Refund resulting from Financial Aid    If the posting of your student aid or loan results in a credit balance, a refund is automatically generated and issued to you, unless there is a hold on your account. Holds can be viewed in the Albert Student Center. If your account is paid partly by a Parent Plus Loan and results in a credit balance, the refund check is issued to the borrower of the loan to the extent of the PLUS Loan processed. Click here to get more information on the Financial Aid Refund Process .       Note: Some charges may still be present on the University bill even though a refund was issued. Federal regulations allow New York University to apply Title IV funds (Stafford, PLUS, PELL, SEOG, etc.) to pay the student&rsquo;s tuition, registration and services fees, and room and board charges.    Non-institutional charges such as finance charges, late payments fees, etc. cannot be paid from your TITLE IV aid. This may result in a refund being generated leaving an outstanding balance on your account for which you are responsible for paying. Students receiving TITLE IV aid who withdraw completely may be billed for remaining NYU account balance resulting from the mandatory return of funds to the U.S. government. Students are responsible for reviewing their bill and ensuring that all charges are paid by the due date.      Refund resulting from an Overpayment or Cancellation of a Charge    For the Fall and Spring semesters, refunds are automatically generated at the beginning the fifth week of classes, unless otherwise noted. You may request your refund before the fifth week of classes by contacting the Bursar's office at (212) 998-2806 or by email to bursar.refunds@nyu.edu .        Fastest Way to Receive Your Refund    Direct Deposit is the fastest and most secure way to receive your refund. By electing this option, a student's refund will be directly deposited into their U.S. checking account, at the financial institution of choice, which is faster than waiting for the check to arrive in the mail."}, {"content": "Ultrafest IV                                  [ Home | Presenter Information | Hotels | Transportation | Map | Register ]                 ULTRAFEST IV Schedule    September 28-29, 2007    New York University               The conference will be held at the Kimmel Center on the NYU Campus.

Refunds are automatically generated the beginning the fifth week of classes, unless otherwise noted. You may request for your refund before the fifth week of classes by contacting the Bursar's office at (212) 998-2806 or by email bursar.refunds@nyu.edu .       Refund resulting from Financial Aid    If the posting of your student aid or loan results in a credit balance, a refund is automatically generated and issued to you, unless there is a hold on your account. Holds can be viewed in the Albert Student Center. If your account is paid partly by a Parent Plus Loan and results in a credit balance, the refund check is issued to the borrower of the loan to the extent of the PLUS Loan processed. Click here to get more information on the Financial Aid Refund Process .       Note: Some charges may still be present on the University bill even though a refund was issued. Federal regulations allow New York University to apply Title IV funds (Stafford, PLUS, PELL, SEOG, etc.) to pay the student&rsquo;s tuition, registration and services fees, and room and board charges.    Non-institutional charges such as finance charges, late payments fees, etc. cannot be paid from your TITLE IV aid. This may result in a refund being generated leaving an outstanding balance on your account for which you are responsible for paying. Students receiving TITLE IV aid who withdraw completely may be billed for remaining NYU account balance resulting from the mandatory return of funds to the U.S. government. Students are responsible for reviewing their bill and ensuring that all charges are paid by the due date.      Refund resulting from an Overpayment or Cancellation of a Charge    For the Fall and Spring semesters, refunds are automatically generated at the beginning the fifth week of classes, unless otherwise noted. You may request your refund before the fifth week of classes by contacting the Bursar's office at (212) 998-2806 or by email to bursar.refunds@nyu.edu .        Fastest Way to Receive Your Refund    Direct Deposit is the fastest and most secure way to receive your refund. By electing this option, a student's refund will be directly deposited into their U.S. checking account, at the financial institution of choice, which is faster than waiting for the check to arrive in the mail."}, {"content": "Ultrafest IV                                  [ Home | Presenter Information | Hotels | Transportation | Map | Register ]                 ULTRAFEST IV Schedule    September 28-29, 2007    New York University               The conference will be held at the Kimmel Center on the NYU Campus.
