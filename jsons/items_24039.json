Agriculture, Food, and Human Values Society (AFHVS), Association for the Study of Food and Society (ASFS), &amp; Society for Anthropology of Food and Nutrition (SAFN).              Co-hosted by New York University and The New School  Wednesday, June 20th - Sunday, June 24th 2012  New York City     Conference Program - Subject to Change     About    As increasingly greater portions of the global population shifts towards urban environments, and cities position themselves as crucial hubs not only for food consumption, but also for its production and distribution, it becomes urgent for agriculture to reposition and reaffirm its strategic role in ensuring food security, access to governance, and acceptable livelihoods for all the actors involved. The theme of the conference highlights the need for more equitable and sustainable distribution of power and resources among various stakeholders, including those without a strong voice on the world&rsquo;s stage, such as the urban and rural poor, farmers, and migrants. In line with the call for sustainable development and green economies at the core of the Rio +20 United Nations gathering, the conference offers an opportunity for scholars, students, activists, farmers, practitioners, and concerned citizens to come together and explore innovative solutions and alternative models for creative, culturally viable, and environmentally sound integration of urban and rural food systems.    New York University and The New School have been at the forefront of the research, methodologies, and pedagogies that have shaped Food Studies, and have explored creative venues of public engagement to establish vital connections and a constructive dialogue between academia, the local communities, and the larger debates at the national and global levels. We welcome not only scholarly sessions, but also encourage activists, government staff, farmers, and practitioners in food and agricultural systems to participate. Organizations, businesses, agencies, and publishers may also participate as exhibitors.    Registration    Advance registration is now closed.

Agriculture, Food, and Human Values Society (AFHVS), Association for the Study of Food and Society (ASFS), &amp; Society for Anthropology of Food and Nutrition (SAFN).              Co-hosted by New York University and The New School  Wednesday, June 20th - Sunday, June 24th 2012  New York City     Conference Program - Subject to Change     About    As increasingly greater portions of the global population shifts towards urban environments, and cities position themselves as crucial hubs not only for food consumption, but also for its production and distribution, it becomes urgent for agriculture to reposition and reaffirm its strategic role in ensuring food security, access to governance, and acceptable livelihoods for all the actors involved. The theme of the conference highlights the need for more equitable and sustainable distribution of power and resources among various stakeholders, including those without a strong voice on the world&rsquo;s stage, such as the urban and rural poor, farmers, and migrants. In line with the call for sustainable development and green economies at the core of the Rio +20 United Nations gathering, the conference offers an opportunity for scholars, students, activists, farmers, practitioners, and concerned citizens to come together and explore innovative solutions and alternative models for creative, culturally viable, and environmentally sound integration of urban and rural food systems.    New York University and The New School have been at the forefront of the research, methodologies, and pedagogies that have shaped Food Studies, and have explored creative venues of public engagement to establish vital connections and a constructive dialogue between academia, the local communities, and the larger debates at the national and global levels. We welcome not only scholarly sessions, but also encourage activists, government staff, farmers, and practitioners in food and agricultural systems to participate. Organizations, businesses, agencies, and publishers may also participate as exhibitors.    Registration    Advance registration is now closed.    If you would still like to partcipate, registration will be open in person at the conference.
