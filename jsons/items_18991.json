An intensive hands-on  shooting experience; projects are shot and lit on the soundstage and on  location. Projects are shot with a  Panasonic Varicam or RED camera. A team of three students (DP/Operator, Gaffer  and DIT) design a scene each week. All students must serve as Key Grip, Gaffer,  and AC on each other\u2019s projects.   On occasion we have a guest DP and DIT demonstate on the soundstage. We take trips to professional vendors  to use 3D, Panavision Genesis, Arri D21 and Technocrane.
