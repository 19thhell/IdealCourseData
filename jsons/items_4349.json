Description         Geophysical fluid dynamics is the  branch of fluid dynamics that describes the large-scale flows in the  atmosphere and oceans. These flows are characterized by the dominant  role of planetary rotation and stratification, resulting in a  dynamical regime that consists of a distinct set of circulations,  waves and turbulence. In this course, students will be introduced to  the elegant approximations and governing equations that describe these  flows. Specific topics include: the advective derivative and  conservation laws, vorticity and potential-vorticity dynamics,  geostrophic and thermal wind balance, shallow water and  quasi-geostrophic flows, gravity and Rossby waves, flow instabilities  and turbulence.
