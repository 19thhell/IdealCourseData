The two central themes will be meaning and reference. We will explore questions like: What is it for a person to mean something by uttering a sentence? What is it for that sentence to mean something? How can ink on a page or sounds emitted from our throats refer to things in the outside world? We will also investigate the profound influence the philosophy of language has had on contemporary philosophy.         time :        Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 11:00-12:15    place :        Room 567, Waverly Building, 24 Waverly Place    website :       http://homepages.nyu.edu/~mjr318/language08/             instructor :      Mike Raven ( raven@nyu.edu )    office :        Room 607, Department of Philosophy , 5 Washington Place    office hours :   Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays 12:30-1:30 , or by appointment.          work :      Two paper assignment and an exam. The instructions for the first paper assignment are here . The instructions for the second paper assignment are here . The exam will be 10:00am-11:50am on Tuesday Dec. 16 . A study guide for the exam is here . A review session will be held in 504 Silver Center, 5:00pm-6:00pm on Thursday Dec. 11.     late policy :      No late work; no exceptions.    evaluation :      You pass the course only if you do the required work and participate in class discussion. You will be evaluated on participation, the exam, and the papers.          required text :     The Philosophy of Language , 5 th ed., edited by A. P. Martinich ( m )              Any readings not in the text will be distributed as handouts in class. Discussion notes will be made available on the course website after the class of which they are about has concluded.    optional text :     Philosophy of Language: A Contemporary Introduction , by William G. Lycan.               No readings will be assigned from this optional text. But you may find it to be a useful supplement to the assigned readings.     readings :       The course is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the nature of meaning. The second part focuses on the nature of reference .  The readings for each part are listed below. The list is ambitious. Moreover, work in the philosophy of language tends to be difficult. We will try to stick to a schedule, but will be flexible enough to allow our comprehension of the material dictate the pace. As a result, the precise schedule for what to read when will be announced as we go. But the following list gives the order of the readings and a rough estimate of how much time will be spent on each .            Part I: The nature of meaning. What is it for a linguistic expression to be meaningful? We will        survey several answers. Two kinds of answer will emerge. We will assess their compatibility.     Introduction: meaning (1 week)    Frege, The Thought: A Logical Inquiry  ( m1 )  [ notes ]    Verificationist theories of meaning, analyticity, and translation (2 weeks)    Ayer, Chapter 1 of Language, Truth, and Logic  ( Handout ) [ notes ]    Quine, Two Dogmas of Empiricism  ( m3 )  [ notes ]    Quine, 7-9,12 of Translation and Meaning  ( m38 ) [ notes ]      Searle, Indeterminacy, Empiricism, and the First Person  ( m41 ) [ notes ]    Truth-conditional theories of meaning (1 week)    Tarski, 1-5,17-18 of The Semantic Conception of Truth and the Foundations of Semantics ( m5 ) [ notes ]       Davidson, Truth and Meaning  ( m 7)  [ notes ]    Intention-based theories of meaning and speech acts (2 weeks)    Grice, Meaning    ( m6 )  [ notes ]       Searle, \"What is a Speech Act?\" (HANDOUT) [ notes ]        Grice, Logic and Conversation  ( m11 )  [ notes ]       Use-theories of meaning (1 week)        Kripke, On Rules and Private Language  ( m43 )  [ notes ]    Lewis, Languages and Language  ( m45 )  [ notes ]         Part II: The nature of reference. How can we use language to refer to things in the world? We will     explore this general question by focusing on a few particular ways language enables us to do so.      Introduction: reference (1 week)    Frege, On Sense and Nominatum  ( m14 )  [ notes ]       Definite descriptions (2 weeks)       Russell, On Denoting    ( m15 )  [ notes ]    Strawson, On Referring    ( m17 )  [ notes ]    Donnellan, Reference and Definite Descriptions  ( m19 ) [ notes ]    Proper names (1 week)    Kripke, Naming and Necessity  ( m21 )  [ notes ]        Natural kind terms (1 week)        Putnam, Meaning and Reference  ( m22 )    Indexicals (1 week)    Perry, The Problem of the Essential Indexical  ( m27 )    Beliefs and belief-reports (1 week)    Kripke, A Puzzle about Belief  ( m32 )           (Thanks to Eliza Block for contributing a few of her lecture notes from our co-taught philosophy of language course, summer 2005)"}]}]
