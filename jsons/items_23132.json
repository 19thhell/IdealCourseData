Together you can imagine, create and refine apps, wearables and other technology that break down barriers to independence and self-expression.   The three-month challenge begins with a hackathon April 18-19 at the NYU ABILITY LAB. Come meet &quot;exemplars&quot; who will guide you on how to design for their disabilities, plus technical experts from NYU and AT&amp;T.   Then, on the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act in July, be among the winners who will collect $100,000 in prizes that will help bring your assistive technology to life. ($10,000 will be awarded for the hackathon alone.)
