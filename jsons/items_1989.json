We are known for our broad view of the discipline, and understand \"literature\" to mean writing in all media, and its study to include all the ways in which texts have been produced, re-produced, circulated, and read, along with the modes of classification and the definitions of enjoyment used to understand them. The scholarly methods we employ, and in which we train our students, include close reading, historical and archival research, literary theory, the history of the book, media theory, and cultural analysis.
