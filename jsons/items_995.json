The protagonist and antagonists fight each other with such intensity that the audience experiences a catharsis, or purging of their emotions. In the twentieth and twenty-first century, terrorist attacks have occurred all over the world. No matter how extensive the strike is, the objective is to instill fear in the general public. So when we create literature about terrorist events, do we minimaze or exaggerate the actual events?      Much of twentieth century literature was influenced by Freud, Jung and other psychoanalytic schools. The dreams and unconscious motivations of characters are often more important than their conscious thoughts and actions.      The terrorist novel goes back to the Gothic novels of the late eighteenth century and the Victorian novels about the anarchist movement and the Russian novels by writers like Dostoyevsky as well as Conrad's early work.      Margaret Scanlan wrote a book about plotting terror and it's true that many of these novels are heavily plotted, just like terrorist attacks.      Professor Keefer presented a paper based Part II, Unclashing Civilizations, of her fantasy trilogy, published in 2006 at the Literature and Terrorism conference in London. After the \"cultural caesura\" of 9/11, the world is returning again to the fictional reconstruction of the kind of terrorist attacks that have been occurring all over the world, mainly inspired by extremist Islamist ideologies that distort the traditional concept of jihad for their own aims which do include undermining the hegemony and power of the U.S. and Europe.                      Catharsis                              In an age of terror, how does literature help us transcend our reality, lend perspective to our confusion by pulling us into the past and other cultures, and give expression to our anguish and fear through catharsis? They survived it; so can we. In this course we will define terrorism the way the Arabs define it, as any organized violence, by an individual, group or state, legitimate or illegitimate, against a civilian population, either intentional or unintentional. Because this is about twentieth and twenty first century literature, we will include the two World Wars with All Quiet on the Western Front, Night , No Exit, The Plague (about Algerian terror) as well as the German occupation and natural scourges, to Islamist militant terrorism in Egypt in The Day The Leader Was Killed, Satanic Verses, God Dies by the Nile and War in the Land of Egypt, t o Israeli/Palestinian terror in Martyr's Crossing and Wild Thorns, to the terror of hostage-taking and kidnapping in Mao II, News of a Kidnapping, and The Hostage, to the terror of totalitarian regimes such as China in Red Azalea and Soul Mountain. Black Water is both a personal and stylistic meditation on terror as well as an indirect indictment of the terror a powerful political leader has over an innocent civilian. Because one objective of fiction/drama is to create a combustive drama for the reader's catharsis, literature and terrorism are really competing with each other. Sometimes real life provides so much terror that the reader hides in literature for escape, seeking fantasy, happy endings, funny, harmless stories that eschew the turmoil of an unlivable situation. Often cultures will move through a transformation like New York did after 9/11, moving from the transformation of reality into tragedy with heroic stories, to silly, innocuous escapes, to some social comedy, and finally to stories that deal with fictional terror. No one can take too much of one thing. When New Yorkers were coughing from the smoke and toxins downtown, they did not go to the movies to see sci fi representations of Manhattan blowing up. Enough is enough.         What books give you a catharsis? What books make you want to throw up? What books don't move you at all?                           Literary Representations of Terror                                          But literature is different from film because we can choose when and how often to put the book down. Instead of watching a naturalistic representation, we recreate the story in our minds to excite, soothe or incite us. Many of the writers we will study had personal experience of a world war, the holocaust, the Israeli checkpoints, prison for their writings or gender brutality such as clitorectomies. Some could not write for years afterwards; others wrote on toilet paper in prison. It is significant that terrorism demands a certain amount of intelligence in order to achieve its devastating effect. Formalist agenda about character, plot, style/language, theme, setting/geography, descriptive techniques and narrative point of view must be supplemented and developed to deal with how \"literature engages with contemporary critical understandings of nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, global multiculturalism...\" I would add cyberspace to the list. I also believe that it is stultifying to repress critical reflection on difference to be politically correct. Not only does it make us oblivious to the richness of difference, but we also lose our sense of humor.            Note how spare the language is in Night, Holocaust Survival and Hiroshima mon Amour . In my book, I wanted distressed students to think and laugh and so I exaggerated, twisted, fantasized in an effort to have the reader transcend the horrible reality of 9/11.            What are the degrees of removal from the documentary event? What is the difference between naturalism and realism, fantasy and sci fi, romantic or surreal interpretations? What increases or mitgates the actual terror for you? In my book I wrote a poem about degrees of separation from 9/11, narrated by Shoes, Watch, and Statue of Liberty.                                                                         Psychoanalytic Criticism                                              Psychoanalytic criticism adopts the methods of \"reading\" employed by Freud and later theorists to interpret texts. It argues that literary texts, like dreams, express the secret unconscious desires and anxieties of the author, that a literary work is a manifestation of the author's own neuroses. One may psychoanalyze a particular character within a literary work, but it is usually assumed that all such characters are projections of the author's psyche.       One interesting facet of this approach is that it validates the importance of literature, as it is built on a literary key for the decoding. Freud himself wrote, \"The dream-thoughts which we first come across as we proceed with our analysis often strike us by the unusual form in which they are expressed; they are not clothed in the prosaic language usually employed by our thoughts, but are on the contrary represented symbolically by means of similes and metaphors, in images resembling those of poetic speech\".             Like psychoanalysis itself, this critical endeavor seeks evidence of unresolved emotions, psychological conflicts, guilts, ambivalences, and so forth within what may well be a disunified literary work. The author's own childhood traumas, family life, sexual conflicts, fixations, and such will be traceable within the behavior of the characters in the literary work. But psychological material will be expressed indirectly, disguised, or encoded (as in dreams) through principles such as \"symbolism\" (the repressed object represented in disguise), \"condensation\" (several thoughts or persons represented in a single image), and \"displacement\" (anxiety located onto another image by means of association).             Despite the importance of the author here, psychoanalytic criticism is similar to New Criticism in not concerning itself with \"what the author intended.\" But what the author never intended (that is, repressed) is sought. The unconscious material has been distorted by the censoring conscious mind.             How can you analyze your passage from this point of view?                                     Us versus Them: The Political Implications of Terrorism                                                          After 9/11, President Bush stomped through Near and Central Asia shouting out his war decree of \"us versus them,\" a disjunctive syllogism that wanted the world to choose between the \"legitimate\" power of the American war machine, capable of a nuclear holocaust, and the \"illegitimate power\" of disparate bands of dedicated Islamist \"terrorists,\" armed with box-cutters, knives, and homemade suicide bombs. Since death is death no matter who inflicts it, why are the Al Qaeda operatives branded as terrorists but the American government isn't? If they could establish world dominion, would \"we\" be branded as terrorists?                Since all war inevitably kills the innocent, what makes terrorist events worse? Is it like the Indians hiding in the bushes while the British colonialists marched forthrightly to battle with their guns and flags? If terrorism is about a \"surprise\" attack, then what about the surprise the Japanese felt when the nuclear bomb decimated Hiroshima and their lives for years afterwards?                If terrorism is a deus ex machina for the victims, what does this do to dramatic structure?                If we continue the \"us versus them\" way of thinking, then how can American novelists like Don DeLillo, Andre Dubus III, and John Updike enter the minds of their Islamist characters? Do they succeed and if not, why not? To enter the mind of my antagonist, Jalal Khalifeh, I became friends with a local Egyptian who used to be in the Muslim brotherhood, and then I traveled all over Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey hanging out with locals, going to mosques, and yes, finding Al Qaeda sympathizers. I learned a lot about the good and bad interpretations of Islam and the lifestyle of devout Muslim men in their twenties but I didn't meet a senior-level Al Qaeda terrorist until I met Ibrahim al-Harbi in my father's nursing home in Ottawa who was a well-respected physician and talented poet. When we went out to dinner, he divulged his radical views, and when I invited him to NYC he implied he was on the watch list. A year later he was apprehended in Syria on his way to Iraq and deported to a Saudi Arabian prison. His limp was from the first Afghan war when he was a teenager. Then he became one of the senior operatives and was planning big things from his oasis in Canada when he was caught. This guy was one of the most brilliant people I have ever met anywhere so although terrorists may use poor people, I am not sure the 21st century terrorism is fueled by that. He hated thepolitical, economic, military, and cultural hegemony of the U.S., what Israel did and does to Palestine, and what European colonialists did to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. He was fighting his own \"us versus them,\" and he was prepared to die for his beliefs like all the other Islamists. It took a lot of courage for me to get inside his head but unfortunately I met him after my book was published! Certainly DeLillo, Updike, and Dubus didn't go through what I went through but they are excellent writers who depict the victims' point of view with sensitivity and perception.                        How do the real-world political conflicts affect the seesaw of dramatic structure in the books you are using? Can an author create the total humanity of a 9/11 hijacker? Are 9/11 novels wrapped in a cocoon of narcissism?         It took great courage to write against the fascist governments of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and Communist China. Based on utopias, deluded thinking, and/or distorted applications of Marxist thinking, these totalitarian governments ironically inspired creativity from their constraints, at least in the beginning. Once those writers were censored, imprisoned, and/or exiled, the dry periods began. But each country is different. While Mao's China fostered a kind of women's liberation with the appointment of female military officers, the librettos of the Peking Revolutionary Opera that turned women into heroes, protection against sexual harassment, and equal rights, the Soviet Union maintained women in subservient roles, and there appears to be an absence or idealization of women in much holocaust literature. Nazi Germany spent a lot of time burning books, and people, and Hitler was a frustrated artist who turned his insanity into genocide, but the Soviet Union had its own kind of realist art and film, and Mao and his wife created beautiful, colorful revolutionary operas, combining ballet, acrobatics, classical opera music, and women's liberation with Marxist plots. Because my father and brother spent a lot of time in Mao's China, I have original versions of most of these operas. Even Anchee Min loved them--at first.                 In order to provoke deeper thinking and help you contribute to your Wikis, imagine that you not free-thinking Westerners but members of these communities, trying to see the appeal of their rhetoric at first. In this Rogerian way of understanding oppositional counterclaims, we can better analyze how and why these fascist governments were successful.                 Fascism also occurs all over Latin America and in many countries in Africa and Asia. But as I said before, we have courses devoted exclusively to Latin American and African literature, so I focus on the major writers of North America, the U.K., the Maghreb and Middle East, China, India, Russia, and Europe. To really understand the literary movements of each of these places, you would need to concentrate on minor and major writers, history, and literary theory.                          Just as it is important to know Chairman Mao's Peking Revolutionary Opera to understand what writers like Gao Xingjian, Anchee Min and Dai Sijie were up against, it is also critical to examine Stalin's program of socialist realism.          The theory    of Socialist Realism was adopted by the Congress of Soviet Writers    in 1934. Approved by Joseph Stalin , Nickolai    Bukharin , Maxim Gorky and Andrey    Zhdanov , Socialist Realism demanded that all art must depict some    aspect of man's struggle toward socialist progress for a better life.    It stressed the need for the creative artist to serve the proletariat    by being realistic, optimistic and heroic. The doctrine considered    all forms of experimentalism as degenerate and pessimistic. The writings of Tolstoi and Dostoyevsky, that depicted the despair in all of us, were banned. Throughout history, we see that when new leaders create new governments, especially through revolution, they seek to control the intellectual and artistic as well as the socio-economic lives of their people. If they fail to do this, the revolution might not succeed.                   Experimental    and non-conformist writers such as Yevgeni    Zamyatin , Isaac Babel , Boris    Pilnyak , Nickolai Tikhonov , Mikhail    Slonimski , Vsevolod Ivanov , Victor    Serge , Vladimir Mayakovsky , Sergei    Yesenin , Konstantin Fedin , Victor    Shklovsky , Mikhail Zoshchenko and Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered    under this policy. Zamyatin and Serge managed to leave the country,    whereas Mayakovsky and Yesenin committed suicide. Writers who refused    to change, such as Babel and Pilnyak, were executed or died in labour    camps.                   Compare and Contrast our 4 Writers:                    Even though most of you will be reading in translation, note the different styles of these four writers. Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize. While Pasternak's style is more poetic, in fact he was a poet, Solzhenitsyn thrives on a naturalistic style that gives a documentary feel to his horrors. If possible, read the 2010 translation of Dr. Zhivago by award-winning translators Richard Pevea r and Larissa Volokhonsky , noted for their versions of War and Peace and Anna Karenina. I met them at the 92nd St Y and was very impressed with their work. Dr, Zhivago was first published in 1957 in Italy and was banned in the soviet Union until 1988. The 1958 english edition of Zhivago was hastily produced for Pasternak's upcoming Nobel Peace Prize, which he declined due to extreme pressure form the Soviet government. Reviewers have said that the new version shows more of the nuances of the original Russian text and will reveal a better understanding of Pasternak's style and the Soviet Union during the 20th century.Ayn Rand and Bulgakov have opposite styles: contrast her straightforward, minimal style, which she ironically censored in Anthem to conform to American mass market taste, with the magical realism of Bulgakov's Master and Margarita, a wild ride that influenced Rushdie's Satanic Verses.                    Boris Leonidovich Pasternak (1890-1960), born in Moscow, was the son of talented artists: his father a painter and illustrator of Tolstoy's works, his mother a well-known concert pianist. Pasternak's education began in a German Gymnasium in Moscow and was continued at the University of Moscow. Under the influence of the composer Scriabin, Pasternak took up the study of musical composition for six years from 1904 to 1910. By 1912 he had renounced music as his calling in life and went to the University of Marburg, Germany, to study philosophy. After four months there and a trip to Italy, he returned to Russia and decided to dedicate himself to literature.                   Pasternak's first books of verse went unnoticed. With Sestra moya zhizn (My Sister Life), 1922, and Temy i variatsii (Themes and Variations), 1923, the latter marked by an extreme, though sober style, Pasternak first gained a place as a leading poet among his Russian contemporaries. In 1924 he published Vysokaya bolezn (Sublime Malady), which portrayed the 1905 revolt as he saw it, and Detstvo Lyuvers (The Childhood of Luvers), a lyrical and psychological depiction of a young girl on the threshold of womanhood. A collection of four short stories was published the following year under the title Vozdushnye puti (Aerial Ways). In 1927 Pasternak again returned to the revolution of 1905 as a subject for two long works: Leytenant Shmidt , a poem expressing threnodic sorrow for the fate of Lieutenant Schmidt, the leader of the mutiny at Sevastopol, and Devyatsot pyaty god (The Year 1905), a powerful but diffuse poem which concentrates on the events related to the revolution of 1905. Pasternak's reticent autobiography, Okhrannaya gramota (Safe Conduct), appeared in 1931, and was followed the next year by a collection of lyrics, Vtoroye rozhdenie (Second Birth), 1932. In 1935 he published translations of some Georgian poets and subsequently translated the major dramas of Shakespeare, several of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, and Ben Jonson, and poems by Pet&ouml;fi, Verlaine, Swinburne, Shelley, and others. Na rannikh poyezdakh (In Early Trains), a collection of poems written since 1936, was published in 1943 and enlarged and reissued in 1945 as Zemnye prostory (Wide Spaces of the Earth). In 1957 Doktor Zhivago , Pasternak's only novel - except for the earlier \"novel in verse\", Spektorsky (1926) - first appeared in an Italian translation and has been acclaimed by some critics as a successful attempt at combining lyrical-descriptive and epic-dramatic styles. An autobiographical sketch, Biografichesky ocherk (An Essay in Autobiography), was published in 1959, first in Italian, and subsequently in English. Pasternak lived in Peredelkino, near Moscow, until his death in 1960.                         Boris Pasternak died on May 30, 1960.                    Although it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, Doctor Zhivago was not completed until 1956. The novel was submitted to the journal \"&#1053;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;&#1081; &#1052;&#1080;&#1088;\" (Novy Mir, Russian for both New World and New Peace ) and rejected because Pasternak's political viewpoint was opposed by the Soviet authorities. [2] The author, like Zhivago, showed more concern with the welfare of individuals than with the welfare of society. Soviet censors construed some passages as anti- Marxist . There are implied criticisms of Stalinism and references to prison camps. In 1957, the Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli smuggled the book manuscript out of the Soviet Union thanks to Isaiah Berlin and simultaneously published editions in both Russian and Italian in Milan , Italy. It was published in English (translated from Russian by Manya Harari and Max Hayward ) the next year and was eventually published in a total of eighteen different languages. The publication of this novel was partly responsible for Pasternak's being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. The Soviet government asked the committee not to award him the prize. Pasternak was pressured by Soviet authorities to reject the Nobel Prize in order to prevent a scandal in the Soviet Union [3] . Pasternak died on 30 May 1960, of natural causes.           Doctor Zhivago was finally published in the Soviet Union in 1988, in the pages of Novy mir , although earlier samizdat editions existed.          Yuri Zhivago is sensitive and poetic nearly to the point of mysticism . Zhivago's idealism and principles stand in contrast to the brutality and horror of World War I , the Russian Revolution , and the subsequent Russian Civil War . A major theme of the novel is how mysticism and idealism are destroyed by both the Bolsheviks and the White Army alike, as both sides commit horrible atrocities. Yuri witnesses dismemberment and other horrors suffered by the innocent civilian population during the turmoil. Even the love of his life, Lara, is taken from him.          Zhivago ponders how war can turn the whole world senseless, and make an otherwise reasonable group of people destroy each other with no regard for life. His journey through Russia has an epic, dreamlike, almost surreal feeling. He travels through a world which is in such striking contrast to himself, relatively uncorrupted by violence. His desire to find a place away from it all drives him across the Arctic Siberia of Russia, and eventually back to Moscow. Pasternak subtly criticizes of Soviet ideology: he disagrees with the idea of \"building a new man,\" which, he suggests, is against nature.          His great love's life is also dealt with in considerable detail. Lara, whose full name is Larissa Feodorovna Guishar (later Antipova), born into the bourgeoisie, is engaged to Pavel \"Pasha\" Antipov, an idealistic young student who becomes involved in Bolshevism through his father. Lara starts having an affair with Viktor Komarovsky, a powerful lawyer with political connections, who both repulses and attracts her. To gain independence from Komarovsky, Lara spends three years working as a live-in nanny for a wealthy family (the Kologrivovs). Upon returning, Lara's brother begs her to get 700 rubles from Komarovsky to repay money that he has gambled away. Lara gets the money from her generous employer, Kologrivov. However, when her pupil Lipa graduates, she feels like she is on charity instead of working for her keep in the Kologrivov household. She decides that Komarovsky \"owes her.\" She attends a party to demand the money from Komarovsky. But he spends the evening playing cards and pays her no attention. She finally walks in and attempts to shoot him but misses. [4]          Lara and Zhivago have a number of brief encounters before truly meeting. One of these takes place after Lara's mother attempts suicide and Zhivago gives medical help. Zhivago also sees Lara at the Christmas party where she tries to shoot Komarovsky. Lara and Zhivago have their first real conversation after a roadside encounter between First World War troop columns: a miserable troop of retreating Russian Army deserters and new recruits bound for the hopeless conditions at the Front. Lara has been serving as nurse while searching for her assumed-dead husband Antipov. Lara and Zhivago serve together in a makeshift field hospital and fall in love. They do not consummate their relationship until much later, meeting in the town of Yuriatin after the war.          Pasha Antipov and Komarovsky continue to play important roles in the story. Pasha is assumed killed in World War I, but is actually captured by the Germans and escapes. Pasha Antipov joins the Bolsheviks and becomes Strelnikov (the shooter), a fearsome Red Army general who becomes infamous for executing White prisoners (hence his nickname). However, he is never a true Bolshevik and yearns for the fighting to be over so he can return to Lara. (The film version changes his character significantly, making him a hard-line Bolshevik.)          Another major character is Liberius, commander of the \"Forest Brotherhood\", the Red Partisan band which conscripts Yuri into service. Liberius is a dedicated and heroic revolutionary. But he is also a cocaine addict, loud-mouthed and vain, and bores Yuri with his constant lectures about the justice of their cause and the inevitability of their victory.          Komarovsky reappears towards the end of the story. He has gained some influence in the Bolshevik government and been appointed minister of justice of the Far Eastern Republic , a Bolshevik puppet state in Siberia. He offers Zhivago and Lara transit out of Russia. They initially refuse. But Komarovsky lies about Pasha Antipov's death and persuades Zhivago that it is in Lara's best interests to leave; Zhivago convinces Lara to go with Komarovsky, telling her (falsely) that he will follow her shortly.          Meanwhile, Antipov/Strelnikov falls from grace, loses his position in the Red Army, and returns to Varykino , near Yuriatin, where he hopes to find Lara. She, however, has just left with Komarovsky. After having a lengthy conversation with Zhivago, Pasha Antipov commits suicide and is found the next morning by Zhivago. (In the movie Komarovsky tells Zhivago that he was captured 5 miles outside of Yuriatin and on the way to his execution he grabbed a pistol from a guard and killed himself.)          Zhivago's life and health go downhill after this; he lives with another woman and has two children with her, plans numerous writing projects but does not finish them, and is increasingly absent-minded, erratic, and unwell. Lara eventually returns to Russia on the day of Zhivago's funeral. She gets Yevgraf, his half brother, to try to find her daughter but then disappears.          During World War II Zhivago's old friends Nika Dudorov and Misha Gordon meet up. One of their discussions revolves around a local laundress named Tanya, a bezprizornaya or parentless child, one of many left by the Civil War, and her resemblance to Zhivago. Much later they meet over the first edition of Zhivago's poems.          Other major characters include Tonya Gromeko, Zhivago's wife, and her parents Alexander and Anna, with whom Zhivago lived after he lost his parents as a child. Yevgraf (Evgraf) Zhivago, Yuri's younger illegitimate half-brother (son of his father and a Mongolian princess), is a mysterious figure who gains power and influence with the Bolsheviks and helps his brother evade arrest throughout the course of the story.          The book is packed full of odd coincidences; characters disappear and reappear seemingly at random, encountering each other in the most unlikely places.          The Russian Revolution was at its core an ideological struggle, forcing young and old alike to align themselves or risk extermination . Its uncompromising nature put great strain on the ideals of individual thought and choice, represented in Yuri Zhivago's constant attempts to come to terms with the Revolution. Yuri is the ultimate individual, expressing himself through poetry and recognizing beauty in all aspects of life. He is frequently overcome by emotion, and is deeply introspective . His affair with Lara was primarily fueled by passion and romanticism. However, he gradually realizes that his commitment to own unique philosophy is rapidly becoming untenable in the face of a crystallizing Soviet ideology. His attempts to exert control over his own individual self end in futility: in one pivotal scene, he wounds and possibly kills several White soldiers despite his best efforts avoid doing so. The taking of lives is a betrayal of his personal core beliefs, and Yuri is horrified and demoralized by the incident. Ultimately, the revolution's refusal to acknowledge the fundamental nature of the individual ensured that regardless of which faction Yuri sided with, he would not be able to survive in the new Soviet era as a true individual.          When he was younger, Zhivago enjoyed having political discussions with educated people, like his uncle Nicholai. Zhivago's views were relatively neutral&mdash;though not a revolutionary zealot , he recognized that Russia needed serious reform. As the story progresses, however, Zhivago realizes that many political activists simply parrot the ideas they have heard, reciting their memorized lines in order to seem intellectual. Still others actively seek power for themselves, taking advantage of the people's thirst for betterment by promising more than they intended to deliver. Pasternak shows what he thought went wrong in the revolution: that initially, revolutionary leaders had good ideas, but because of human failings these ideas were warped or even forgotten as the revolution progressed. Pasternak's strategy to convey this point is to introduce seemingly obvious villains into the plot, but show that in the context of the entire novel, the results of their bad behavior pales in comparison to the harm caused by the corrupted revolutionary effort. Komarovsky and Strelnikov are both antagonists in the sense that they cause harm to other characters in the book, but Pasternak cleverly uses them to show that their damage was temporary and relatively minor, whereas the trauma and suffering caused by the misled train wreck of the revolution was more permanent, often fatal, and certainly more devastating to Russian society.                    Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn          I was born at Kislovodsk on 11th December, 1918. My father had studied philological subjects at Moscow University, but did not complete his studies, as he enlisted as a volunteer when war broke out in 1914. He became an artillery officer on the German front, fought throughout the war and died in the summer of 1918, six months before I was born. I was brought up by my mother, who worked as a shorthand-typist, in the town of Rostov on the Don, where I spent the whole of my childhood and youth, leaving the grammar school there in 1936. Even as a child, without any prompting from others, I wanted to be a writer and, indeed, I turned out a good deal of the usual juvenilia. In the 1930s, I tried to get my writings published but I could not find anyone willing to accept my manuscripts. I wanted to acquire a literary education, but in Rostov such an education that would suit my wishes was not to be obtained. To move to Moscow was not possible, partly because my mother was alone and in poor health, and partly because of our modest circumstances. I therefore began to study at the Department of Mathematics at Rostov University, where it proved that I had considerable aptitude for mathematics. But although I found it easy to learn this subject, I did not feel that I wished to devote my whole life to it. Nevertheless, it was to play a beneficial role in my destiny later on, and on at least two occasions, it rescued me from death. For I would probably not have survived the eight years in camps if I had not, as a mathematician, been transferred to a so-called sharashia , where I spent four years; and later, during my exile, I was allowed to teach mathematics and physics, which helped to ease my existence and made it possible for me to write. If I had had a literary education it is quite likely that I should not have survived these ordeals but would instead have been subjected to even greater pressures. Later on, it is true, I began to get some literary education as well; this was from 1939 to 1941, during which time, along with university studies in physics and mathematics, I also studied by correspondence at the Institute of History, Philosophy and Literature in Moscow.                    In 1941, a few days before the outbreak of the war, I graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Rostov University. At the beginning of the war, owing to weak health, I was detailed to serve as a driver of horsedrawn vehicles during the winter of 1941-1942. Later, because of my mathematical knowledge, I was transferred to an artillery school, from which, after a crash course, I passed out in November 1942. Immediately after this I was put in command of an artillery-position-finding company, and in this capacity, served, without a break, right in the front line until I was arrested in February 1945. This happened in East Prussia, a region which is linked with my destiny in a remarkable way. As early as 1937, as a first-year student, I chose to write a descriptive essay on \"The Samsonov Disaster\" of 1914 in East Prussia and studied material on this; and in 1945 I myself went to this area (at the time of writing, autumn 1970, the book August 1914 has just been completed).                    I was arrested on the grounds of what the censorship had found during the years 1944-45 in my correspondence with a school friend, mainly because of certain disrespectful remarks about Stalin, although we referred to him in disguised terms. As a further basis for the \"charge\", there were used the drafts of stories and reflections which had been found in my map case. These, however, were not sufficient for a \"prosecution\", and in July 1945 I was \"sentenced\" in my absence, in accordance with a procedure then frequently applied, after a resolution by the OSO (the Special Committee of the NKVD), to eight years in a detention camp (at that time this was considered a mild sentence).                    I served the first part of my sentence in several correctional work camps of mixed types (this kind of camp is described in the play, The Tenderfoot and the Tramp ). In 1946, as a mathematician, I was transferred to the group of scientific research institutes of the MVD-MOB (Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of State Security). I spent the middle period of my sentence in such \"SPECIAL PRISONS\" ( The First Circle ). In 1950 I was sent to the newly established \"Special Camps\" which were intended only for political prisoners. In such a camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan ( One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich ), I worked as a miner, a bricklayer, and a foundryman. There I contracted a tumour which was operated on, but the condition was not cured (its character was not established until later on).                    One month after I had served the full term of my eight-year sentence, there came, without any new judgement and even without a \"resolution from the OSO\", an administrative decision to the effect that I was not to be released but EXILED FOR LIFE to Kok-Terek (southern Kazakhstan). This measure was not directed specially against me, but was a very usual procedure at that time. I served this exile from March 1953 (on March 5th, when Stalin's death was made public, I was allowed for the first time to go out without an escort) until June 1956. Here my cancer had developed rapidly, and at the end of 1953, I was very near death. I was unable to eat, I could not sleep and was severely affected by the poisons from the tumour. However, I was able to go to a cancer clinic at Tashkent, where, during 1954, I was cured ( The Cancer Ward, Right Hand ). During all the years of exile, I taught mathematics and physics in a primary school and during my hard and lonely existence I wrote prose in secret (in the camp I could only write down poetry from memory). I managed, however, to keep what I had written, and to take it with me to the European part of the country, where, in the same way, I continued, as far as the outer world was concerned, to occupy myself with teaching and, in secret, to devote myself to writing, at first in the Vladimir district ( Matryona's Farm ) and afterwards in Ryazan.                    During all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared that this would become known. Finally, at the age of 42, this secret authorship began to wear me down. The most difficult thing of all to bear was that I could not get my works judged by people with literary training. In 1961, after the 22nd Congress of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party and Tvardovsky's speech at this, I decided to emerge and to offer One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich .                    Such an emergence seemed, then, to me, and not without reason, to be very risky because it might lead to the loss of my manuscripts, and to my own destruction. But, on that occasion, things turned out successfully, and after protracted efforts, A.T. Tvardovsky was able to print my novel one year later. The printing of my work was, however, stopped almost immediately and the authorities stopped both my plays and (in 1964) the novel, The First Circle , which, in 1965, was seized together with my papers from the past years. During these months it seemed to me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake by revealing my work prematurely and that because of this I should not be able to carry it to a conclusion.                    It is almost always impossible to evaluate at the time events which you have already experienced, and to understand their meaning with the guidance of their effects. All the more unpredictable and surprising to us will be the course of future events.                                    Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940)                    Russian journalist, playwright, novelist, and short story writer, whose major work was the Gogolesque fantasy The Master and Margarita . In the story the Devil visits Stalinist Moscow to see if he can do some good. The book is considered a major Russian novel of the 20th century. It first appeared in a censored form in the Soviet journal Moskva in 1966-67. Bulgakov used satire and fantasy also in his other works, among them the short story collection Diaboliad (1925).           It was hard to say exactly what had made Bezdomny write as he had--whether it was his great talent for graphic description or complete ignorance of the subject he was writing on, but his Jesus had come out, well, completely alive, a Jesus who had really existed, although admittedly a Jesus who had every possible fault.\"            (from The Master and Margarita )           Mihail Bulgakov was born in Kiev, Ukraine, the eldest son of a theology professor at the Kiev Theological Academy. After attending First Kiev High School (1900-09), Bulgakov studied medicine at the Kiev University (1909-16). From 1916 to 1918 he served as a doctor in front-line and district hospitals. These experiences he described in notes of a young doctor, 'Zapiski yunogo vracha' (1925-26).           In 1918-19 Bulgakov worked as a doctor in Kiev, and witnessed the German occupation and then the occupation by the Red Army. During these war years he used a morphine, but with the helped of his first wife he managed to win the addiction. In 1920 Bulgakov abandoned medicine in favor of a career as a writer. He organized in Vladikavkaz, Caucasus, a 'sub-department of the arts', wrote stories for newspapers           Bulgakov moved in 1921 to Moskow, where he worked for the literary department of the People's Commissariat of Education, and wrote as a journalist for various groups and papers. His largely autobiographical novel BELAYA GVARDIYA (1925, full text 1973, The White Guard) was an account of the turbulent years between 1914 and 1921 as reflected in the lives of a White family in the Ukraine. Two parts of the book was published in the journal Rossiya , which was closed before the third part could appear. Bulgakov abandoned his plans for a trilogy; the proofs of the new ending surfaced in 1987, but the final pages were missing.           From 1925 Bulgakov was associated with the Moscow Arts Theatre. He wrote and staged many plays, which enjoyed great popularity. Bulgakov's criticism of the Soviet system was not swallowed by the authorities. The Heart of the Dog (written in 1925), a satire on Soviet life in the guise of science fiction, was condemned unpublishable. In the story 'Pokhozhdenia Chichikova' the protaginist of Gogol's Dead Souls was dropped in the middle of the Soviet Russia's New Economic Policy period of 1921-27. 'Diaboliad' (1925) portrayed a poor clerk in a gigantic bureaucracy, where he loses his identity and life.           In 1928 Bulgakov had three plays running in three Moscow theatres, Zoya's Apartment , The Crimson Island , and The Days of the Turbins , dramatized from his novel The White Guard . It brought the author overnight success and became 'a new Seagull ' for the new generation, although it also received hostile reviews for the sympathetic portrayal of White officers. Paradoxically, The White Guard was one of Stalin's favorite plays. It was banned in 1929, reinstated in 1932 but not published until 1955.           By 1930s Bulgakov's works were published rarely or not at all - Zoya's Apartment (1926), a play set in an atelier-bordello, was banned, as The Crimson Island (1928). Flight (1928), dealing with White fugitives leaving Russia, was banned before its premiere. In 1929 he wrote to Maxim Gorky: \"All my plays have been banned; not a line of mine is being printed anywhere; I have no work ready, and not a kopeck of royalties is coming in from any source; not a single institution, not a single individual will reply to my applications...\"           After writing a letter to Soviet government, requesting permission to emigrate, Bulgakov received a personal telephone call from Stalin and was employed as an assistant producer with the Moscow Arts Theatre. He adapted classics for the stage. During the late 1930s he was librettist and consultant at Bolshoi Theatre. However, Stalin's favour protected Bulgakov only from arrests and executions, but his writings remained unpublished. In Black Snow, a Theatrical Novel , Bulgakov described his love-hate relationship and took a revenge on Stanislavsky for the failure of his play A Cabal of Hypocrites , produced under the title Moli&egrave;re . In one scene Louis XIV, the Sun King, says: \"Then hear this: my author is oppressed. He is frightened. I will show kindness to anyone who forewarns me of whatever danger imperils him... The ban is lifted. You may stage Tartuffe .\" The Last Days was performed first in 1943 under the title Pushkin . Bulgakov's stage version of Gogol's Dead Souls had a modest success.           Bulgakov's most important work was The Master and Margarita , a fantasy about the Devil, disguised as a professor, who causes havoc in the city. The work was suppressed because Bulgakov refused to make the changes reguired by the authorities. Although Bulgakov worked still on the text on his death bed, the novel was completed. The first Soviet edition was published in 1966-67, a fuller text appeared in 1973 and the revised full text in 1989.           The Master and Margarita (1928-40). Published in installments in 1966 and 1967 in the journal Moskva . The large novel takes place on three levels, each of which provides a commentary on the others. Historical narrative is set in Jerusalem, where Pontius Pilate condemns to death a man, Jeshua, whom he knows to be innocent. Contemporary narrative is set in Moscow, in the 1930s, where the Master and Margarita live and where the Master has written a novel about Pilate. The third, fantastic level introduces the devil, who steps out of Goethe's Faust. He appears in Moscow with a retinue that includes an enormous black cat. The devil, Woland, is unconventionally seen as a relatively sympathetic figure, Righteous Man in Sodom. Moreover, the character of Jesus, called Yeshua, in not very Biblical. The philosophical and religious themes and examination of the freedom of art circulate around the intrusion of the devil into the life of modern Moscow and the crucifixion of Christ. Interacting and competing discourses from the realms of science, religion, literature, history, and politics, complicate further the narrative. Master burns his manuscript and retires to a madhouse. Margarita's love for the master drives her to a pact with Satan. However, \"manuscripts don't burn\" and Woland defends the existence of Jeshua.            Bulgakov composed two versions of the work. One was written at home and another, when he did not have the original available, was born while he was living with a mistress. Much of the the satire is aimed at greed, vanity, and pettiness, but is possible to read the book as a tribute to Stalin's policy to cut the bourgeois elements of Soviet society. After the publication Bulgakov was seen as a link between such writers as Vasilii Aksenov, Andrei Siniavskii, and the Strugatskii brothers, and the great past tradition of Gogol and Dostoevskii.           Bulgakov was married three times: with Tatiana Nikolaevna Lappa (1913), Liubov Evgenevna Belozerskaia (1924), and Elena Sergeevna Shilovskaya (1932), who gave invaluable support to the author when he wrote The Master and Margarita and had his fits of paranoia. Bulgakov was writing Black Snow , his theatre novel, when he died in Moskow on March 10, 1940. It took until the 1980s before all Bulgakov's works could be printed in his own home country. For decades Bulgakov was considered an outsider and the most \"un-Soviet\" writer. Supernatural and occult attracted him, and he used sudden cuts into the fantastic and mockery. Although he was subjected to a number of restrictions as a writer, he survived attacks from the officials, when others were imprisoned and perished in the 'Gulag Archipelago'.                   Ayn Rand                    Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. At age six she taught herself to read and two years later discovered her first fictional hero in a French magazine for children, thus capturing the heroic vision which sustained her throughout her life. At the age of nine, she decided to make fiction writing her career. Thoroughly opposed to the mysticism and collectivism of Russian culture, she thought of herself as a European writer, especially after encountering Victor Hugo, the writer she most admired.                    During her high school years, she was eyewitness to both the Kerensky Revolution, which she supported, and&mdash;in 1917&mdash;the Bolshevik Revolution, which she denounced from the outset. In order to escape the fighting, her family went to the Crimea, where she finished high school. The final Communist victory brought the confiscation of her father's pharmacy and periods of near-starvation. When introduced to American history in her last year of high school, she immediately took America as her model of what a nation of free men could be.           When her family returned from the Crimea, she entered the University of Petrograd to study philosophy and history . Graduating in 1924, she experienced the disintegration of free inquiry and the takeover of the university by communist thugs. Amidst the increasingly gray life, her greatest pleasures were Viennese operettas and Western films and plays. Long an admirer of cinema, she entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting. It was at this time that she was first published: a booklet on actress Pola Negri (1925) and a booklet titled &ldquo;Hollywood: American Movie City&rdquo; (1926), both reprinted in 1999 in Russian Writings on Hollywood .           In late 1925 she obtained permission to leave Soviet Russia for a visit to relatives in the United States. Although she told Soviet authorities that her visit would be short, she was determined never to return to Russia. She arrived in New York City in February 1926. She spent the next six months with her relatives in Chicago, obtained an extension to her visa, and then left for Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter.           On Ayn Rand&rsquo;s second day in Hollywood, Cecil B. DeMille saw her standing at the gate of his studio, offered her a ride to the set of his movie The King of Kings, and gave her a job, first as an extra, then as a script reader. During the next week at the studio, she met an actor, Frank O&rsquo;Connor, whom she married in 1929; they were married until his death fifty years later.           After struggling for several years at various nonwriting jobs, including one in the wardrobe department at the RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she sold her first screenplay, &ldquo;Red Pawn,&rdquo; to Universal Pictures in 1932 and saw her first stage play, Night of January 16th , produced in Hollywood and then on Broadway. Her first novel, We the Living , was completed in 1934 but was rejected by numerous publishers, until The Macmillan Company in the United States and Cassells and Company in England published the book in 1936. The most autobiographical of her novels, it was based on her years under Soviet tyranny.           She began writing The Fountainhead in 1935 (taking a short break in 1937 to write the anti-collectivist novelette Anthem ). In the character of the architect Howard Roark, she presented for the first time the kind of hero whose depiction was the chief goal of her writing: the ideal man , man as &ldquo;he could be and ought to be.&rdquo; The Fountainhead was rejected by twelve publishers but finally accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company. When published in 1943, it made history by becoming a best-seller through word of mouth two years later, and gained for its author lasting recognition as a champion of individualism.           Ayn Rand returned to Hollywood in late 1943 to write the screenplay for The Fountainhead , but wartime restrictions delayed production until 1948. Working part time as a screenwriter for Hal Wallis Productions, she began her major novel Atlas Shrugged , in 1946. In 1951 she moved back to New York City and devoted herself full time to the completion of Atlas Shrugged.           Published in 1957, Atlas Shrugged was her greatest achievement and last work of fiction. In this novel she dramatized her unique philosophy in an intellectual mystery story that integrated ethics , metaphysics , epistemology , politics , economics and sex . Although she considered herself primarily a fiction writer, she realized that in order to create heroic fictional characters, she had to identify the philosophic principles which make such individuals possible.           Thereafter, Ayn Rand wrote and lectured on her philosophy&mdash; Objectivism , which she characterized as &ldquo;a philosophy for living on earth.\" She published and edited her own periodicals from 1962 to 1976, her essays providing much of the material for six books on Objectivism and its application to the culture . Ayn Rand died on March 6, 1982, in her New York City apartment.           Every book by Ayn Rand published in her lifetime is still in print, and hundreds of thousands of copies are sold each year, so far totaling more than 25 million. Several new volumes have been published posthumously. Her vision of man and her philosophy for living on earth have changed the lives of thousands of readers and launched a philosophic movement with a growing impact on American culture.                     This includes Everything is Illuminated, All Quiet on the Western Front, Night, Holocaust Survival, The German Mujahid (revisited) and the Kindly Ones if you are ambitious.                     Jonathan Safran Foer is currently a professor of creative writing at NYU.          Everything is Illuminated was Foer's first novel published in 2002 when he was in his twenties and so it was considered a work of precocious genius. It chronicles a young, Jewish-American writer's attempt to research his grandfather's life in Ukraine. Jonathan, who has the same name as the book's author, is attempting to find his grandfather's shtetl, Trachimbrod. He has only a few maps and a photograph of a woman named Augustine, who is said to have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Jonathan's guide on his trip is Alex, a young Ukrainian man. They are both twenty-one. Their driver is Alex's grandfather, who claims to be blind. Accompanying the men is Grandfather's seeing-eye dog Sammy Davis Junior, Junior. The novel is comprised by three basic narratives: chapters written by Jonathan, chapters written by Alex, and letters from Alex to Jonathan. Chapters written by Jonathan describe different events in his family's history in Trachimbrod. Chapters written by Alex describe Jonathan's present trip. Letters from Alex to Jonathan reveal the two characters' growing relationship as writers and friends. This book has Safran Foer's unique postmodern style, distorting language to fit narrators even if it means ESL grammar, typographical innovations, and non-linear sequencing.           Although unconfirmed by Foer, it is speculated that the title of the book is an inspiration from a line in the novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera: 'In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia.'                     Remarque 1898-1970                     German writer, who became famous with his novel IM WESTEN NICHTS NEUES (tr. All Quiet on the Western Front , 1929), which depicted the horrors of war from the point of view of the ordinary soldiers. In his works Remarque focused largely on the collapse of the old European world and values. Although his later novels also were successful, Remarque lived in the shadow of his \"big\" first book.           \"It is just as much a matter of chance that I am still alive as that I might have been hit. In a bomb-proof dug-out I may be smashed to atoms and in the open may survive ten hour's bombardment unscratched. No soldier outlives a thousand chances. But every soldier believes in Chance and trusts his luck.\" (from All Quiet on the Western Front )           Erich Maria Remarque was born in Osnabr&uuml;ck, Lower Saxony, into modest circumstances. His ancestors were French, the family name was 'Germanized' early in the nineteeth century. Peter Franz Remark, Remarque's father, was a poorly paid bookbinder. Although Franz Remark did not show much interest in intellectual activities, except his interest in the occult, the family had a piano, and at one point in his life Remarque planned a musical career. In 1904, at the age of six, Remarque entered the Domschule (cathedral school), and four years later he moved to the Johannisschle. Remarque was \"always the best in class\", as one of his closest school friends later recalled.           For a time Remarque studied at the University of M&uuml;nster, but had to enlist in the German army at the age of 18. Remarque fought on the Western Front and was wounded several times. After his discharge Remarque had taken a teacher's course offered to veterans by the government. He taught for a year in a school, and tried also his hand as a stonecutter and a test-cardriver for a Berlin tire company.           Remarque began his writing career as a sporting journalist, eventually becoming the assistant editor of Sportbild . Among his friends was Leni Riefenstahl, who later made the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will (1935), and the two-part Olympia (1938), about the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. Remarque's wife, Jutta Zambona, \"tall, slender as a fashion model, and strikingly dressed\", as Riefenstahl described Jutta in her book of memoir later inspired heroines in his books. The marriage was stormy, and they both had extra-marital activities. His longest, intercontinental affair Remarque had with Marlene Dietrich; they met first time in Venice in the late 1930s.           Fame came with Remarque's first novel, All Quiet on the Westerns Front, which touched a nerve of the time, and sparkled off a storm of political controversy. The book, which first had been rejected by one publisher, sold 1.2 million copies in its first year. H.L. Mencken called it \"unquestionably the best story of the World War.\" Its sequel, DER WEG ZUR&Uuml;CK ( The Way Back ), appeared in 1931. It dealt with the collapse of the German Army after the war, and the fate of the surviving heroes, Ernst and his friends.           All Quiet on the Western Front is the most famous novel dealing with World War I. The book starts in 1917 after a battle, in which half of Paul B&auml;umer's company has been killed. B&auml;umer is mostly the narrator and Remarque goes through his life in flashbacks. Paul and his classmates have been encouraged by their teacher, Kantorek, to enlist the German army. B&auml;umer's group includes some school fellows, and Katczinsky, an older man. The group goes through basic training and go to the front. B&auml;umer tries to understand what is going on. He realizes that back home \"no one had the vaguest idea what we were in for. The wisest were just the poor and simple people. They knew the war to be a misfortune, whereas those who were better off, and should have been able to see more clearly what the consequences would be, were beside themselves with joy.\" Paul visits home on leave, returns to the trenches, is wounded and sent to a military hospital. In the summer of 1918 German front is pushed back, and the soldiers are waiting for the end of the war. In October, when           there is nothing much to report on the western front, Paul is killed, a week or so before the armistice. - The story is narrated in first person in a cool style, a contrast to patriotic rhetoric. Remarque records the daily horrors in the trenches, where machine guns killed millions, in laconic understatement. - \"At the next war let all the Kaisers, Presidents and Generals and diplomats go into a big field and fight it out first among themselves. That will satisfy us and keep us home.\" (Katzinsky) Lewis Milestone's film (1930), based on the novel, is a landmark of American cinema. One of the best scenes is when Paul (Lew Ayres) returns to his school and tells new students the truth. \"When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all.\" The film was denounced by Goebbels as anti-German, but the Poles banned it for being pro-German. Particularly effective were the tracking shots of soldiers attacking enemy lines. In France it was prohibited until 1962. The close-up of Paul's hand reaching for the butterfly at the end, is actually the hand of the director Milestone. - A sequel, The Road Back , was made in 1937.           With All Quiet on the Western Front Remarque became a spokesman of \"a generation that was destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells,\" as he said himself. The German defeat inspired two major war films of the year 1930 - G.W. Pabst's Westfront 1918 , adapted from a novel by Ernest Johannsen and Lewis Milestone's film based on Remarque's novel. Milestone was unhappy with the original script - he saw it changed the point of the book, and he hired his friend Del Andrews and George Abbott, a stage director, the shape the final script. The producer Carl Laemmle Junior and Milestone both hated the original ending of the book, in which Paul Baumer dies heroically. Karl Freund, the cameraman, put forward the idea of the hand stretching out toward the butterfly.           In the 1930s Remarque's books were banned in Germany by the government. All Quiet on the Western Front and The Road Back were among the works consigned to be publicly burnt in 1933 by the Nazis. Stores were ordered to stop selling his books. The film's premiere was disrupted by Nazi gangs; Remarque was accused of pacifism. It was not until the 1950s the film was shown again in West Germany. In 1938 Remarque lost his citizenship. He had moved to Switzerland in 1932 and in 1939 he emigrated to the United States, where in 1947 he became a citizen. In New York he spent much time at the Stork Club and at 21. In Hollywood he made friends with stars, including the actress Paulette Goddard (1911-1990), whom he married in 1958. Remarque had been married twice before, and to the same woman, Jutta Ilse Ingeborg Ellen Zambona, in 1925 and again in 1938. After the war Remarque settled eventually back in Switzerland, where he made his residence at Porto Ronco on the Seiss shore of Lake Maggiore. His play, DIE LETZTE STATION, about the fall of the Third Reich, was produced in Berlin in 1956. Remarque died at the Sant Agnese clinic at Locarno, on September 25, 1970. He had suffered for months from aneurysm.           \"If things went according to the death notices, man would be absolutely perfect. There you find only first-class fathers, immaculate husbands, model children, unselfish, self-sacrificing mothers, grandparents mourned by all, businessmen in contrast with whom Francis of Assisi would seem an infinite egoist, generals dripping with kindness, humane prosecuting attorneys, almost holy munitions makers - in short, the earth seems to have been populated by a horde of wingless angels without one's having been aware of it.\" (from The Black Obelisk , 1956)           Remarque's later works, depicting the political upheavals of Europe from the 1920s to the cold war, did not achieve the critical acclaim of his first novel. However, his skill to create interesting characters, fascinating plots, and balancing between realistic and sentimental scenes made him a highly popular writer. DREI KAMERADEN (1937) received good reviews and was made into a film in 1938, directed by Frank Borzage. The screenplay was written by Edward A. Paramore and F. Scott Fitzgerald , who was determined to do a good job. Fitzgerald kept completely sober, for a while. However, his contract with M-G-M was not renewed. The final scene in which the two friends of the story are joined by their ghostly comrade, has still a strong emotional charge. Several of Remarque's later novels dealt with people struggling under Nazi rule. Arch of Triumph (1946) told a story about a German refugee physician and an actress. The work was adapted into screen in 1947, starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. Remarque himself played the schoolmaster Pohlmann in A Time to Love and a Time to Die (1958), based on his novel ZEIT ZU LEBEN UND ZEIT ZU STERBEN (1954). In the story a German soldier, Ernst Graeber, on furlough from the Russian front, falls in love with his childhood friend, Elisabeth. But he must return to the trenches. The German edition was censored for its \"unnational\" passages. Douglas Sirk's film version, beautifully photographed in CinemaScope, ends dramatically in Graeber's death.           Spark of Life (1952) was a fictional documentary about life in Nazi concentration camps. The Black Obelisk (1956) was a tragi-comedy, in which Remarque explored the chaotic Germany of in the 1920s. Remarque's screenplay The Last 10 Days for G.W. Pabst's film from 1956, was based Judge Michael A. Musmanno's book 10 Days to Die , a study of the death of Hitler in a Berlin bunker. DIE NACHT VON LISSABON (1962, The Night in Lisbon), in which two refugees from Nazism flee in Portugal, and SCHATTEN IN PARADIES, depicting refugees in the United Sates, were published posthumously in English in 1971.                      Primo Levi, 1919-1987                      Italian-Jewish writer and chemist, who first gained fame with his autobiographical story SE QUESTO &Egrave; UN UOMO (1947, If This is a Man) of survival in Nazi concentration camps. For the last forty years of his life Levi devoted himself to attempting to deal with the fact that he was not killed in Auschwitz. \"The worst survived, that is, the fittest; the best all died,\" he said. Levi also published poetry, science fiction, essays, and short stories. In 1987, at the age of 67, he killed himself. Italo Calvino called Levi \"one of the most important and gifted writers of our time.\"            Consider whether this is a man,            Who labours in the mud            Who knows no peace            Who fights for a crust of bread            Who dies at a yes or a no.            Consider whether this is a woman,            Without hair or name            With no more strength to remember            Eyes empty and womb cold            As a frog in winter.            (from 'Shem&aacute;' in Collected Poems )            Primo Levi was born in Turin into a Jewish middle-class family, the son of Cesare Levi, an engineer, and Ester \"Rina\" Luzzati; she had been his secretary. His grandmother Bimba was a baroness. She and her entire family had been made barons by Napoleon, because they had supported him economically. As a youth Levi knew very little about Jewishness, but Mussolini's anti-Semitic policy soon taught Levi that it was not ''a cheerful little anomaly'' in a Catholic country. An underdeveloped, quiet boy, Levi was derided at school for his size. Through cycling and mountain climbing he acquired friends, but according to a biography he did not have any sexual experience before meeting his wife, Lucia, in 1946. Just before the Fascist racial law of 1938 forbade Jews access to academic status, Levi started his chemistry studies at the University of Turin. He graduated first in his class in 1941, the year after Italy had entered World War II as an ally of Germany. During the war Levi wrote for the resistance magazine Giustizia e Libert&agrave; .            After the collapse of Mussolini's regime, he tried to contact a partisan group in the north of Italy. Levi was captured in December 1943. \"I was twenty-four,\" Levi wrote in If This Is a Man , \"with little wisdom, no experience and a decided tendency ... to live in an unrealistic world of my own, a world inhabited by civilized Cartesian phantoms, by sincere male and bloodless female friendships.\" He was first interned in a transit camp in F&ograve;ssoli, and then, two months later, deported to the camp of Moniwitz-Auschwitz. The number 174517 was tattooed on his left forearm.            From the railroad convoy of 650 people, fifteen men and nine women survived. Levi worked at one of three I.G. Farben laboratories and was spared the gas chambers. The company made synthetic rubber for the Nazi war machine. As a chemist he knew he could safely eat cotton wool and drink paraffin. A non-Jewish guest worker secretly gave him extra helpings of soup. To his friend Jean Samuel he taught Italian by quoting Dante; eating and translating Dante were both keys to survival. Dante remained a constant point of reference throughout Levi's writing. From the Ulysses episode of Inferno he chose a passage, which dealt with the crucial question \"What is a man?\" Levi's superior in the laboratory, Dr. Ferdinand Mayer, gave him a pair of leather shoes.            Liberated by the Soviets in January 1945, Levi returned to Turin in October. He took up his work as a chemist, living in a stately old building that his family had occupied for three generations. In 1961 Levi became the general manager of a factory producing paints. He retired in 1977 to become a full-time writer. With Hety Schmitt-Maas, whose husband had been a chemist for I.G. Farben, Levi corresponded almost 20 years. She also helped Levi to track down Dr. Meyer and sent him German books and newspaper clippings on Nazism.            His prison recollections Levi wrote in the form of a memoir, Se questo &egrave; un uomo , which documented how the camp deprived prisoners of their identity and finally annihilated them. When the major publisher Einaudi rejected the work, it was published by a small house. Ten years later it was reprinted in an enlarged edition. In Italy the book sold over half a million copies, was translated into eight languages and adapted for the theater and radio. Part of the book's impact was based on Levi's sober and precise style. In spite of the brutality to which he was subjected Levi described the terrible events objectively like an observing scientist, but also noted with compassion the heroism in the suffering.            Its sequel, LA TREGUA (1963), portrayed Levi's wanderings in war-torn eastern Europe in Poland, Belorussia, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania. During the journey Levi meets a gallery of colorful, rootless companions in misfortune, among them Mordo Nahum, a Greek, from whom Levi learns that in war you must first think of shoes, then the food. Without shoes you can't go after food. Levi returns home on the last pages of his account, but he has a continual nightmare in which his present life turns out to be a mere illusion and he wakes up with Auschwitz's morning call: \"Wstawac\". But Levi also uses his experiences as a basis for philosophical meditations, which connects the book to Jorge Sempr&uacute;n's L'&eacute;criture ou la vie (1994, Literature or Life), dealing with the return to life after the camp.            \"It is not at all an idle matter trying to define what a human being is.\"                        LA CHIAVE A STELLA (1978, The Monkey's Wrench) presented vivid stories told by Libertini Faussone, a construction worker and self-educated philosopher. The writer-chemist listens to him, and records his experiences in different parts of the world. \"All kids dream of going into the jungle or the desert of Malaya, and I also had those dreams, only I like to have my dreams come true; otherwise they're like some disease you carry around with you all your life, or like the scar of an operation that, whenever the weather turns damp, it starts aching again.\" Among Levi's other works is IL SISTEMA PERIODICO (The Periodic Table, 1975), which uses the Russian chemist Mendeleyev's periodical table of elements as the basis of autobiographical meditations. Its 21 pieces are each named after a chemical element. \"Every element brings a kind of 'click' for me,\" Levi wrote. \"It triggers a memory.\" 'Argon' is a homage to the author's Jewish ancestors. 'Vanadium' represents Levi's uncanny encounter with a former official in Auschwitz, Dr. M&uuml;ller, who was the chief of the laboratory, and 'Zinc', a boring metal, explorers the fascist myth of racial purity. SE NON ORA, QUANDO? (1989, If Not Now, When?) combined the emergence of Jewish consciousness and documentation of action taken on the Russian front by partisan Jewish groups against retreating Nazi forces. A group of Jewish partisans moves toward Palestine, blows up trains, and rescues victims of concentration camps.             \"Two years before the war began, the bell rope broke. It snapped near the top; the stairs were rotten; the bell ringer was an old man, and he was afraid to climb up there and put in a new rope. So after he announced the time by shooting a hunting rifle into the air; one shot, or two or three or four, That went on till the Germans came. They took his gun away from him, and the village was left without any time.\" (from If Not Now, When? )             Levi died in Turin on April 11, 1987. His death was apparently a suicide - Levi hurled himself down the central stairwell of his home building. Before and after Auschwitz Levi had suffered from depression, but his death was interpreted as a sign that he had not triumphed over his horrible experiences. In a lecture in 1979 Levi had expressed his deeply pessimistic view of humanity, seeing life as terrible. The last work he completed was the essay collection I SOMMERSI E I SALVATI (1986), where Levi returned to his belief in the historical uniqueness of the Holocaust. He asked how much of the camp is alive and well in our time, and how long it will remain in our memories. Levi points out that anti-Semitism was part of German culture, not merely a Nazi invention, and sees a paradoxical analogy between victim and oppressor. In the camp system also the oppressed unconsciously strove to identify with their oppressor. Useless violence dehumanises both guards and prisoners. \"Before dying the victim must be degraded, so that the murderer will be less burdened by guilt,\" he stated.                                   Elie Wiesel's statement, \"...to remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all...\"stands as a succinct summary of his views on life and serves as the driving force of his work. Wiesel is the author of 36 works dealing with Judaism, the Holocaust, and the moral responsibility of all people to fight hatred, racism and genocide.             Born September 30, 1928, Eliezer Wiesel led a life representative of many Jewish children. Growing up in a small village in Romania, his world revolved around family, religious study, community and God. Yet his family, community and his innocent faith were destroyed upon the deportation of his village in 1944. Arguably the most powerful and renowned passage in Holocaust literature, his first book, Night , records the inclusive experience of the Jews:             Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.             Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.             Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.            And Wiesel has since dedicated his life to ensuring that none of us forget what happened to the Jews.            Wiesel survived Auschwitz, Buna, Buchenwald and Gleiwitz. After the liberation of the camps in April 1945, Wiesel spent a few years in a French orphanage and in 1948 began to study in Paris at the Sorbonne. He became involved in journalistic work with the French newspaper L'arche . He was acquainted with Nobel laureate Francois Mauriac, who eventually influenced Wiesel to break his vowed silence and write of his experience in the concentration camps, thus beginning a lifetime of service. Wiesel has since published over thirty books, earned the Nobel Peace Prize, been appointed to chair the President's Commission on the Holocaust, awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement and more. Due to a fateful car accident in New York in 1956, Wiesel spent a year confined to a wheelchair while recovering. It was during this year that he made the decision to become a U.S. citizen and is still today an active figure within our society, as well as fulfilling his role in Jewish politics around the world.             Wiesel's job as chairman of the President's Commission on the Holocaust was the planning of an American memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The Report to the President on the President's Commission on the Holocaust focuses on memory. Wiesel writes that the reason for creating the museum must include; denying the Nazi's a posthumous victory, honoring the last wish of victims to tell, and protecting the future of humanity from such evil recurring. Always maintaining his dedicated belief that although all the victims of the Holocaust were not Jewish, all Jews were victims of the Holocaust, Wiesel advocated placing the major emphasis of the memorial on the annihilation of the Jews, while still remembering the murder of other groups.             Guided by the unique nature of the Holocaust and the moral obligation to remember, the Commission decided to divide and emphasize the museum into areas of memorial, museum, education, research, commemoration and action to prevent recurrence. In order to come to these decisions, a group of 57 members of the Commission and Advisory Board -- including Senators, Rabbis, Christians, professors, judges, Congressmen, Priests, Jews, men and women -- traveled to Eastern Europe, Denmark and Israel to study Holocaust memorials and cemeteries and to meet with other public officials. The emotional pain and commitment required by such a trip is remarkable, and Wiesel's leadership is undeniably noteworthy.                                                                                                                             Wiesel with Yitzhak Rabin                                                 Wiesel remained chairman of the Committee until 1986. He has aided in the recognition and remembrance of Soviet Jews, the establishment of Israel and has dedicated the latter part of his life to the witness of the second-generation and the vital requirement that memory and action be carried on after the survivors have all left us. Wiesel's own words are the best explanation:            Let us remember, let us remember the heroes of Warsaw, the martyrs of Treblinka, the children of Auschwitz. They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them.

They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them.                          The German Mujahid by Boualem Sansal is also part of this cluster as well as the Islamic one. It's common knowledge that, at the end of WWII, many German war criminals fled from justice via \"ratlines\" to South American countries. Less notorious, though, are the Nazis who, like the title character of Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal's excoriating new novel found permanent refuge in Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria and Algeria. Inspired by a visit to a European-style Algerian village whose mayor was a former SS officer, and by what he views as the Arab world's \"erasure\" of the Holocaust, Sansal has written a bracingly unsentimental, ingeniously structured story that not only lays bare past collusions between German fascists and Arab governments, but draws explicit parallels between Nazism and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, all the while grappling with the emotive question: \"are we responsible for the crimes of our fathers, of our brothers, of our children?\"             The German Mujahid is narrated by Malrich, a disaffected, thuggish teenager who lives on a deprived Arab housing project outside of Paris in the mid-1990s. After being expelled from school, he'd been passing the time all too typically for a kid of his background: \"I hung around the streets, took a couple of courses and a few part time jobs, did a bit of dealing, went to the mosque, wound up in court.\" But when Malrich is seventeen, his educated and professional 33-year-old brother Rachel commits suicide and leaves behind his diaries, which turn Malrich's world upside down. He discovers that their parents, who had sent the boys from Algeria to live in Paris as children, were massacred by Islamists in their village, A&iuml;n Deb, two years earlier during Algeria's \"dirty war,\" and that when Rachel returned home to visit their graves, he unearthed a secret even more horrifying than the manner of that brutal death. The contents of a suitcase in the family home&mdash;medals, military records, and souvenirs&mdash;revealed unequivocally that Rachel and Malrich's German father, Hans Schiller, was a highly-decorated SS officer personally responsible for the extermination of thousands of Jews at Auschwitz and Buchenwald.                                      Malrich's own diary with its pitch-perfect voice&mdash;streetsmart, bemused, loyal and lovable&mdash;is interspersed with excerpts from his brother's diary, whose entries are at first measured and reflective, but become increasingly traumatized and desperate as Rachel is eaten up by guilt, rage and an obsessive need to absorb every last detail of the agonies experienced by prisoners in the camps. Retracing the steps of his father's ghastly career, Rachel \"travels back through time,\" to Germany, Austria, Poland, Turkey, and Egypt. It is while at Auschwitz and Birkenau that he decides he will kill himself, \"for my father, for his victims, I will pay in full.\"              As Malrich attempts to somehow come to terms with what has happened to him and learn about the Holocaust&mdash;which, he admits, \"he didn't know anything about&hellip;I'd heard bits and pieces, things the imam said about the Jews and other stuff I'd picked up here and there\"&mdash;he resolves that \"where my father and Rachel had failed, I had to survive.\" But both brothers' lives are inescapably determined by their father's actions. Rachel literally turns himself into a concentration camp victim, growing more emaciated and haunted until, head shaved and wearing striped pyjamas, he gasses himself on the anniversary of his father's death, \"the day Hans Schiller finally eluded the justice of men.\" Malrich, on the other hand, directs his shame outward to save his beloved \"Sensitive Urban Area, Category 1\" housing project, which has slowly but surely been taken over by Islamists who are creating \"a concentration camp,\" with an atmosphere of \"all conquering Islam.\" Telling his friends that \"we're going to live, we're going to fight,\" Malrich considers it his legacy and his duty to first declare war on the \"Nazi jihadist fuckers,\" and then to \"tell the truth, all over the world.\"              Sansal's own compulsion to tell the truth all over the world is hampered, sadly, by the reality that although The German Mujahid has won plaudits in France including the RTL-Lire Prize, has been translated into German and Hebrew, and is being published in separate American and British editions, not only are there no plans to translate it into Arabic, but Sansal's work is banned in Algeria. The author, who refers to himself as \"secular in every bone in my body,\" had published several novels that sold well in his home country, having turned to writing after retiring from his job as Director of the Algerian Ministry for Industry. But with the publication in 2006 of Poste restante: Alger. Lettre de colere et d'espoir a mes compatriots &mdash;an open letter to his fellow citizens decrying the Nationalist-Islamist regime, which he says is teaching young Algerians an edited version of history&mdash;all of his books were removed from shelves.              Such censorship is particularly ironic given Sansal's mission as an artist. In writing The German Mujahid he wanted \"to ask what it might mean to take responsibility for ensuring that such crimes are never repeated,\" and the answer the novel gives is clear: it means heeding Primo Levi's insistence to \"Remember these words&hellip;Repeat them to your children.\" In its unflinching exploration of the horrors of history and its clear-eyed journey across the entire spectrum of humanity from good to evil, The German Mujahid mesmerizes from the very first sentence and commands you not to evade or recoil. Even the comfort of a hopeful conclusion is resisted; the closest thing to a consolation offered to the reader is the knowledge that Malrich will, as he promises, survive, and some day do what Rachel had wanted to: visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem: \"I'll read the names aloud, and, after every one, I'll ask their forgiveness in my father's name.\" Yet although reaching the end will leave you drained, devastated, and reeling, you'll still want to go back to the first page and start again. Sansal is a novelist at the absolute height of his powers and has, in raking over such ugliness, created a work of extraordinary beauty.                           Jonathan Littell              Jonathan Littell&rsquo;s The Kindly Ones begins, &ldquo;Oh my human brothers.&rdquo; In so doing, he loses no time in posing the question that the next thousand pages seek to answer: How can men treat their human brothers with calculating and unrelenting cruelty? The speaker is a former SS officer. His direct address is essential to this enterprise, and more than one note of chilling irony can be heard therein. One such is his uncommon cultivation. Littell, a dual citizen of France and the United States, wrote his novel in French, and many of its first readers recognized the famous opening line (&ldquo; Fr&egrave;res humains qui apr&egrave;s nous vivez &rdquo;) of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon&rsquo;s &ldquo; Ballade des pendus ,&rdquo; in which the poet, awaiting execution, begs for clemency. Unlike Villon, however, Littell&rsquo;s narrator, Maximillian Aue, seeks no pardon&mdash;and needs none. He has already eluded capture and, more than half a century after the war&rsquo;s end, leads an outwardly tranquil life manufacturing lace in northern France, married and with two children (who know nothing of his earlier life). He has decided to tell his long, grim tale. As he does, apostrophe will turn to accusation: &ldquo;Now of course the war is over. And we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson, it won&rsquo;t happen again. But are you quite sure we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson? Are you certain it won&rsquo;t happen again?&rdquo;                            Aue&rsquo;s story begins with the entry of the German Army into Ukraine in 1941 and ends with the fall of Berlin in 1945. The intervening stations are among the most horrific the war offered, from the massacre at Babi Yar to Stalingrad to Belzec and Auschwitz. Aue notes early on that what follows is &ldquo;a bleak story, but an edifying one too, a real morality play.&rdquo; For it to be edifying, however, Aue must be something other than what&rsquo;s expected. While he may witness and commit acts few would hesitate to call evil, his evil is far from banal and in no way corresponds to a stereotype. Aue is neither a blinkered lackey nor a bloodthirsty sadist. On the contrary, he is independent-minded, sensitive, and articulate. He does not believe Nazi propaganda concerning Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, or foreigners (he is himself bisexual and half-French). Nevertheless, he is at the tip of the spear&mdash;in the SS.               The result for the reader is a thought experiment of a special sort. We are inclined to declare that killers are not my human brothers. It&rsquo;s much more difficult to see that evil is made up of the same stuff as good. In The Gulag Archipelago , Solzhenitsyn remarked that &ldquo;the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either&mdash;but right through every human heart.&rdquo; Aue makes a similar case, stressing that not only psychopaths made the Holocaust possible. There were indeed such tortured and torturing souls, but they were a tiny minority, just as they were in Rwanda, Bosnia, Chechnya, and the other places Littell has spent time working for aid organizations. Some surely loved violence and craved blood; some suffered from madnesses we may be unable to understand. But there were also those&mdash;the vast majority&mdash;whose positions we can all too easily imagine. &ldquo;There are psychopaths everywhere, all the time,&rdquo; Aue says. &ldquo;Our quiet suburbs are crawling with pedophiles and maniacs, our homeless shelters are packed with raving megalomaniacs; and some of them do indeed become a problem, they kill two, three, ten, even fifty people&mdash;and then the very same State that would without batting an eye send them to war crushes them like a blood-swollen mosquito. These sick men are nothing. But the ordinary men that make up the State&mdash;especially in unstable times&mdash;now there&rsquo;s the real danger. The real danger for mankind is me, is you.\"                           An unknown American writer (even a bilingually educated one) who attempts to write an immense novel in French would usually expect to receive nothing but mockery for his trouble. As if the linguistic effort weren't audacious enough, then there's the subject matter: an epic of World War II gore and phantasmagoria from the point of view of a reflective--but largely unrepentant--German SS officer. It's the sort of literary high-wire act that should have ended in a face plant. Instead, Jonathan Littell's The Kindly Ones somehow swept France's top literary prizes when it was published in 2006. Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette histoire?                            After a brief prologue in which the narrator introduces himself as a war criminal in hiding, the action opens with the Germans' brutal invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and concludes, almost a thousand pages later, with Berlin in ashes in 1945. The protagonist and narrator, Dr. Max Aue, bobs along with the flow and ebb of German fortunes on the Eastern Front like a stormtrooper Candide--except that he inflicts as well as endures enormous suffering.                            Aue is not only an enthusiastic Nazi, but a first-class catastrophe of misdirected sexuality. Without giving anything away about his issues, let's just say that he gives anyone in Dr. Freud's files--or Greek tragedy--a run for their money. Yet whatever sympathy the narrator may occasionally earn for his tortured personal backstory, sporadic self-awareness and reliable literary flair is quickly squandered by his willing participation in many of the Nazi regime's atrocities, as well as several that are entirely his own.                            Aue's idiosyncratic psyche is a literary creation and not--as some critics have mistakenly assumed--some kind of psychosexual explanation of Nazism of the sort once popular but now largely discarded. Littell has no grand new theories of evil to offer, and to the extent he makes the rather commonplace observation that we are all capable of it, this is actually undercut by Aue's spectacular weirdness. Nor does Littell shed much light on the \"whys\" of the Holocaust, although the attentive reader will learn plenty about the \"how\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ever since Cervantes wrote Don Quixote, the novel has fluctuated between fact and fiction, sometimes digging so deeply into the whys of reality that fiction becomes truer than fact, or rather presents a side to reality that reveals deeper understanding. Raw reality, brutal honesty, and \"gruesome\" facts can often be too hard to take which is why relationships are coated in lies and social institutions from governments to marriages rely on censorship and suppression for the common good. As the novelist rips open the facade of lies, she reveals a frightening truth or a horror similar to what Conrad, Achebe, and Mario Vargas Llosa found in colonial Africa and South America. By definition novels are works of literary arts in which language, story-telling, structure, sequencing, and style create an aesthetic experience that contains or frames the \"truth\" they represent and often make the horror easier to stomach for both author and reader.      Heart of Darkness is based on his autobiography but like a recursive memoir, he plays with time, frames the narrative, and repeats certain salient conversations, incidents, and images to go deeper into the essential evil he found in every man, an evil that the African jungle exposed in its \"darkness.\" As a master prose stylist, he uses rich figurative language, rhythm, and tone color to give his horror an aesthetic form and the frame to distance the narration because the raw truth devastated him. What techniques do authors use to make the truth palatable?        As an orphan and exile, Conrad left his homeland to roam the seas during those scary years of rabid colonialism. For twenty years he led the practical life of a sailor, somehow managing to survive the worst misadventures. But his six months in the Congo under Leopold II were horrific. He was on a river boat that made its way to Stanley Falls, he got sick, and his job was to take out an even sicker agent like Kurtz who also died en route. He left disillusioned and disgusted with the entire African misadventure. And so he had to write about it.      Achebe lived in Nigeria and his Things Fall Apart is based on the real life of indigenous people and the history of the area. However, he structures this book as a Shakespearean tragedy with Okonkwo playing the \"king\" with the dramatic flaw--his machismo, pride, temper, stubbornness--that cause his misfortunes as much as the colonialists. This dramatic balance gives more weight to the novel where Africans are not just victims of greedy white colonialists but flawed persons in their own right who make fatal mistakes. He also sees the flaws of the culture and the inhumanity of their superstitions and beliefs especially regarding the killing of children. Yet Achebe took Conrad's writing literally and analyzed it as if it were of his time, 50 years later, which hardly seems fair. The irony is that Achebe benefited immensely from the British system of education, the British literary canon, and the English language. He became a scholar and professor, published his immensely successful Things Fall Apart in 1958 and spent most of his life in the U.S., in Ivy League schools like Bard on the Hudson for 15 years and his final days at Brown. He died in Boston March 21, 2013. Although he protested against Conrad's \"racism\" and fought against the Biafran war and other injustices, his life was that of a English language professor and novelist. In other words, he owed his career to his British education and opportunities and so there are many sides to colonialism. Most of his writing is in a realistic mode but he draws from African folk tales as well as the British canon.      The bottom line is that every culture has something good to offer and something bad to repudiate, i.e. there is no black and white in the literal sense.                    This book is long but brilliant! Quite simply, it's the sheer virtuosity of Littell's writing, which shines through in Charlotte Mandel's English translation, and does not falter even in rendering the most technically difficult and morally uncomfortable tableaus. His inventiveness jolts crackling energy into familiar history--an absolutely startling 87-page dive into the Battle of Stalingrad at the center of the novel being only one outstanding example. The awful grandeur of the subject, the breadth and depth of the author's historical research, the ease with which he shifts from naturalism to surrealism and allegory to farce, his perfect ear for dialogue in what is not only a foreign language but a completely alien way of thinking, the fearlessness with which he portrays the repellent--all of these are marks of a monumental achievement. If literary power is a function of ambition multiplied by ability, this book is simply off the charts.           Many readers will be overwhelmed by the violence of these blood-soaked pages, others by the often-numbing bureaucratic detail of how it was unleashed. Some will find unendurable the Nazi ideology spouted at length by Aue and other characters (though not endorsed, it goes without saying, by the author). Those left unoffended by the foregoing will still have to contend with Littell's exhaustive--and I mean exhaustive--fleshing out of Aue's tormented sexuality. But even this side of the story is told with uncommon skill, and convincingly embedded with the tale of Germany's rampage and destruction.                                    Most of classical Holocaust literature is written in a graceful, realistic, minimal style. What happens when the language were Gothic, over-the-top, satirical, funny, and exaggerated like Foer's book? What does language do to the tragedy of these events? How do authors like Littell and Sansal capture the voice of the other? What do you think of evil and good?                           Communist China                                          Gao Xingjian, born January 4, 1940 in Ganzhou (Jiangxi province) in eastern China, is today a French citizen. Writer of prose, translator, dramatist, director, critic and artist. Gao Xingjian grew up during the aftermath of the Japanese invasion, his father was a bank official and his mother an amateur actress who stimulated the young Gao's interest in the theatre and writing. He received his basic education in the schools of the People's Republic and took a degree in French in 1962 at the Department of Foreign Languages in Beijing. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) he was sent to a re-education camp and felt it necessary to burn a suitcase full of manuscripts. Not until 1979 could he publish his work and travel abroad, to France and Italy. During the period 1980-87 he published short stories, essays and dramas in literary magazines in China and also four books: Premier essai sur les techniques du roman moderne / A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction (1981) which gave rise to a violent polemic on \"modernism\", the narrative A Pigeon Called Red Beak (1985), Collected Plays (1985) and In Search of a Modern Form of Dramatic Representation (1987). Several of his experimental and pioneering plays - inspired in part by Brecht, Artaud and Beckett- were produced at the Theatre of Popular Art in Beijing: his theatrical debut with Signal d'alarme / Signal Alarm (1982) was a tempestuous success, and the absurd drama which established his reputation Arr&ecirc;t de bus / Bus Stop (1983) was condemned during the campaign against \"intellectual pollution\" (described by one eminent member of the party as the most pernicious piece of writing since the foundation of the People's Republic); L'Homme sauvage / Wild Man (1985) also gave rise to heated domestic polemic and international attention.      In 1986 L'autre rive / The Other Shore was banned and since then none of his plays have been performed in China. In order to avoid harassment he undertook a ten-month walking-tour of the forest and mountain regions of Sichuan Province, tracing the course of the Yangzi river from its source to the coast. In 1987 he left China and settled down a year later in Paris as a political refugee. After the massacre on the Square of Heavenly Peace in 1989 he left the Chinese Communist Party. After publication of La fuite / Fugitives , which takes place against the background of this massacre, he was declared persona non grata by the regime and his works were banned. In the summer of 1982, Gao Xingjian had already started working on his prodigious novel La Montagne de l'&Acirc;me / Soul Mountain , in which - by means of an odyssey in time and space through the Chinese countryside - he enacts an individual's search for roots, inner peace and liberty. This is supplemented by the more autobiographical Le Livre d'un homme seul / One Man's Bible .      A number of his works have been translated into various languages, and today several of his plays are being produced in various parts of the world. In Sweden he has been translated and introduced by G&ouml;ran Malmqvist, and two of his plays ( Summer Rain in Peking , Fugitives ) have been performed at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.      Gao Xingjian paints in ink and has had some thirty international exhibitions and provides the cover illustrations for his own books.

Vols. 27 &amp; 28, 1995-96.                        Soul Mountain is my favorite Chinese book because it depicts the ecological and history of China set in the oppressive world on Chinese communism where Buddhism and Confucianism form a spectral backdrop and the style is forged through an innovative postmodern use of the pronouns I, he, she, and you that deconstructs the psyche in a unique Chinese version of psychoanalysis that holds true to the sense of actual place and geography in the Eastern landscape.      While Gao&rsquo;s thinking may have some kinship with Lockean empiricism, he has taken his thinking and experience further into another area&mdash;his spatial deconstruction of self into nature, the past, and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy. The four pronouns experience nature differently even as the narrator travels through the mountains as a single human entity, a bit the way lone hikers &ldquo;dissolve&rdquo; after hours of hacking through the Appalachian trail. I think he won the Nobel Prize in part because he offered this new vision of self based on his experiences with the Cultural Revolution, his brush with death, his study of Euro-existentialism, and his ability to dissolve into nature as a hiker. Like much of Chinese culture, the deconstruction is spatial. Although there are dreams in this novel, his perception of self is deliberately fractured into he, you, I, and she.       the linear direction of a purposeful &ldquo;will.&rdquo; So his immurement is transcended by dissolving the conventional sense of self, wrapped up in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of conditioning, particularly Maoist thought, to experience the sensuality of all aspects of mind/body/spirit and the fusion of experience in the divine now where he plays with the Zen koan of God as a frog. How does this sense of self differ or enhance previous definitions in Euro-American and Arabic literature or even your perceptions of your self in the entrepreneurial workplace? He won the Nobel in part because of the creative spatial deconstruction of self and courageous journey into nature and the past when such trips were censored and politically blasphemous.             Born in China in 1954, Dai Sijie is an award-winning author and filmmaker. Caught up in China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution, he was \"re-educated\" between 1971 and 1974, and spent time working in a camp in a rural part of Sichuan province. After his re-education, he completed high school and university in China before departing for France in 1984 on a scholarship. He directed his first film in 1989. His first novel, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress was published in France in 2000. The translation became a national bestseller in America.             Sijie currently lives and works in Paris, France.       The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s was, of course, anything but. Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress describes the lives of the narrator and his close friend Luo during those years, as they are sent to a remote region for re-education by the peasants in 1971, when they are in their late teens. Neither is even a high school graduate yet, but as the sons of doctors they are suspicious -- obviously tainted by their bourgeois intellectual backgrounds -- and so, like millions of others of Chinese of the time, forced to participate in this disastrous social experiment.         They are sent to a truly remote corner of China: the alarm clock they bring along is the only timepiece in town, and it's a considerable journey even just to a place where movies are occasionally shown. Life is dreary and hard there, but the power of storytelling offers some respite: Luo and the narrator are sent to watch the films shown in the distant town and then re-tell them for the locals.         The power of storytelling becomes even more convincing when they come upon a stash of books that another acquaintance of theirs, being re-educated nearby, has managed to hoard. Books -- except, of course, the writings of Mao and perhaps Enver Hoxha -- are dangerous objects in this time (and nearly everyone they encounter is illiterate). The reactions of Luo and the narrator -- and then those they relate the stories they have read to -- perhaps explain why: Dai does an excellent job of conveying the rapture of losing oneself in the words and stories found in these books, so very different from the oppressive, dreary, and dangerous everyday lives of everyone here. They are all translated works: Balzac, Dumas, Romain Rolland, Tolstoy, Dickens, and more -- a treasure-trove of classical Western literature.         Four-Eyes, whose books they are, is unwilling to share his treasure, but after Luo and the narrator's appetite has been whetted by a sampling of Balzac they will do almost anything to get their hands on the suitcase containing these works. They are particularly eager also because not only are they invigorated by the marvels contained in the books, but they see what effect the words can have on others -- notably the little Chinese seamstress who lives fairly nearby.         The power of the books is great, the recounted stories intoxicating to those who the two share them with. And the books are of great value in this world, the only currency the two have to save the lives of one of the characters at one point. The books change several lives in the novel, showing that even in the darkest times imaginations (and ambitions) can not be entirely fettered.         Beside the books, Dai also offers a good small picture of China during the Cultural Revolution -- the small (and great) outrages, the petty humiliations, the people who managed to get by better than others within the system (notably Four-Eyes and his mother), the incredible poverty in the Chinese countryside. The book moves too quickly over much of this, offering a few episodes to focus on and skipping over long periods of (admittedly probably very dreary) time. Still, it offers a good glimpse of China during the Cultural Revolution, and of the power of literature (and the deep loathing for a system and people who keep literature out of the hands of readers).                   Anchee Min&rsquo;s (b 1956) writing has been praised for its raw, sharp language and historical accuracy. Her bestselling memoir, RED AZALEA, the story of her childhood in communist China, has been compared to THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK. Min credits the English language with giving her a means to express herself, arming her with the voice and vocabulary to write about growing up during China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution. &ldquo;There was no way for me to describe those experiences or talk about thoLike every child of her generation, Min was taught to write &ldquo;Long Live Chairman Mao!&rdquo; before she was taught to write her own name. She believed in Mao and Communism. At the age of 17, Min was sent to a labor camp near East China Sea, where she discovered the truth of Mao&rsquo;s calling. She endured mental and physical hardships, which included a severe spinal cord injury. She worked for three years before talent scouts spotted her toiling in a cotton field. Madame Mao, preparing to take over China, was looking for a leading actress for a propaganda film. Min was selected for having the ideal &ldquo;proletarian&rdquo; look. Mao died before the film was complete, and Madame Mao, blamed for the disaster of the revolution, was sentenced to death. Min was labeled a political outcast by association. She was disgraced, punished, and forced to perform menial tasks in order to reform herself. In 1984, with the help of a friend overseas, Min left China for America. She spoke no English when she arrived in Chicago, but within six months had taught herself the language in part by watching &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Roger&rsquo;s Neighborhood&rdquo; on American television.              Since the completion of RED AZALEA, Min has written six subsequent works of historical fiction: KATHERINE, BECOMING MADAME MAO, WILD GINGER, EMPRESS ORCHID, THE LAST EMPRESS, PEARL OF CHINA. The books attempt to re-record histories that have been falsely written. &ldquo;If my own history is recorded falsely, how about other people?&rdquo; she asks. Both critics and writers have praised her work, calling it &ldquo;historical fiction of the first order.&rdquo; Her most recent book, PEARL OF CHINA (April 2010/Bloomsbury), is a fictional account of the 40 years that writer Pearl S. Buck spent in China..              September 29, 2000             TBR: With so much having been written already about Madame Mao, what made you choose her as your subject for your novel, BECOMING MADAM MAO?             AM: It was the process, the process of how she, a beautiful woman who once possessed tremendous innocence, turned into a monster. I hadn't seen that done before.             TBR: What was your research process like? How much of what you knew of her as a historical figure was correct and what new things did you learn about her that you found fascinating?             AM: The research process was long and hard. It took me five years just to get my notes straight. Most of the crime she was accused of was correct. What's fascinating to learn was that Mao was behind her in her major moves, i.e. the Cultural Revolution. I had the idea most people had at the beginning: that she was simply a power-craver, a White-bone-demon as she is universally known. I was surprised to discover a lot of human side to her. The Jiang Ching Madame Mao as a lover, a wife, and a mother.             TBR: Ultimately, what will her legacy be, as an icon and as a woman?             AM: To the people of China she would most likely remain her official title as the White-bone-demon for quite a time. To me she would be an icon of a very sad time and a woman who lost her soul to demons as she rebelled against the society, which treats women as grass to be walked on.             TBR: Is the title also a reference to your BECOMING MADAME MAO since you wrote the book in the first person and thus created a voice for Madame Mao --- did you channel her through your own sensibilities?             AM: Not really, although I did channel her through my own sensibilities. It was not natural for me to think of her in that way. It was a difficult writing process. On the one hand I had to do her justice, which meant that I shouldn't be judgmental; on the other, I had a hard time comprehending her in many cases. For example, I couldn't bring myself to justify the lives she had taken during the Cultural Revolution in order to revenge and protect her career. She was heartless and purely evil. I hated her.             TBR: How did your writing change after the enormous success of your memoir RED AZALEA?             AM: The main change was the self-confidence. I started to believe that I could write. So I pushed myself to be more original, creative, and to develop the courage to deal with failure when it happens.             TBR: What was the most difficult thing about writing RED AZALEA?              AM: To live the time over again. It was painful.               TBR: How was writing KATHERINE, your first novel, different from your experience writing BECOMING MADAME MAO?               AM: The scale was much larger both in background and characters. There were four major characters in KATHERINE while more than twenty in BECOMING MADAME MAO. Also, I had to follow the record of history tightly in BECOMING MADAME MAO. It was a totally different experience.               TBR: When did you decide to be a writer? As a former actress, what skills did you learn in that art form that affected your writing life?               AM: I didn't decide. The reason I wrote was to learn English so I could graduate from college and get a job to be a small firm secretary. I never dared to dream. I was a new immigrant and survival was the only thing on my mind at the time. Talking about being a former actress, I was never one to begin with. Madame Mao's people picked me from a cotton field for the way I looked --- a proletarian peasant, not that I had any acting skills. I love writing because I don't have to show my face. I had a chance to be exposed to a lot of classic monologues while studying acting. Maybe that affected my writing.               TBR: How do you see the Internet affecting the future of fiction? Do you read ebooks or books online?               AM: The Internet is affecting everything on the face of the earth. Future fiction has to be created unique enough in a non-replaceable form to survive and thrive. I haven't had the chance to explore ebooks or books online yet.               TBR: Would you ever consider writing a story or book that would only be available online?               AM: I need to give the idea some thought before I know what I am talking about on this issue.               TBR: Do you believe that the sharing of history like this can help to change the contemporary world? By learning from the past?               AM: Definitely.               TBR: What books and authors have influenced you the most throughout your life?               AM: I have to give you a list of Chinese names. Most of these authors are unknown to the western public, i.e. Tang Xian-zu of 1200. I read him when I was 14 in a dark storage where Red Guards placed their rooted goods.               TBR: What are you reading now?               AM: Historical documents. I am doing it for my next project. In fact, I just got back from China last week. I spent my summer digging out books in the basement of the Museum of History in Shanghai. Every time I got in, I felt like a cockroach being sprayed --- the book-storage is heavily sprayed with chemicals in order to prevent the bugs from eating the pages away. It is a place filled with treasure --- lots of out of print and lost books. Material that is crucial to my subject. I am reading everything that interests me around the late Qing Dynasty 1800-1911.               TBR: In one sentence, what is one piece of invaluable advice you have picked up over the years of writing?               AM: I ask myself, \"Will you still write if this piece doesn't get published?\" If the answer is yes, then I know that I meant to write it.

Second draft of webfolios due. Be prepared  to read aloud. Group discussions on &quot;How to find and develop good  stories&quot; and &quot;The American Dream.&quot;   New York-- The Twenties versus  the Nineties. Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Even though  they symbolize the American Dream, what are the prisons embedded in The Great  Gatsby, Jazz and Cosmopolis? Is your American Dream just to be--  happy? Remember this when we get to Brave New World. In the twenties, the  American Dream was Forbidden Fruit for many Americans. Langston Hughes captures  this dilemma brilliantly in his poem, Harlem--   What happens to a dream  deferred?   Does it dry up   Like a raisin in the sun?   Or does it fester like a sore -   And then run?   Does it stink like rotten meat?   Or crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet?   Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.   Or does it explode?   The following is my favorite descriptive  passage from The Great Gatsby because I love the way he personifies the lawn  and uses kinesthetic imagery to capture the brazen energy and grandiosity of  the nouveau riche and the role the women, particular Daisy, play in this  splendid charade-- &quot;Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a  cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn  started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile,  jumping over sun-dials and brick walls and burning gardens--finally when it  reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the  momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing  now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom  Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.   He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw-haired man  of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining,  arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the  appearance of always leaning aggessively forward. Not even the effeminate swank  of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed to  fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see  a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It  was a body capable of enormous leverage--a cruel body....   We walked through a huge hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely  bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and  gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way  into the house. A breeze blew thorugh the room, blew curtains in at one end and  out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake  of the ceiling-- and then ripple over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on  it as wind does on the sea.   The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on  which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an achored balloon. They  were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they  had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have  stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the  groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the  rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and  the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.&quot;  (11-12) Note the synesthesia--&quot;groan of a picture,&quot; the use of dashes  to make the description dynamic, and the way these short passages show how  completely Tom dominates the scene, physically, sexually, materially--but maybe  not spiritually.   Note how DeLillo deconstructs his  journey through Manhattan. Is the author seeping in through Benito? Is this a  naturalistic journey? DeLillo does not orchestrate his characters, although he  is a fierce and fabulous social critic. Every word must succumb to his personal  style--   DeLillo simply and vividly describes  his raison d'etre-- &quot;I am a sentence maker. Like a donut maker, only  slower,&quot; or &quot;Every sentence has a truth waiting at the end of it and  the writer learns how to know it when he finally gets there. On one level this  truth is the swing of the sentence, the beat and poise, but down deeper it's  the integrity of the writer as he matches with the language. I've always seen  myself in sentences. I begin to recognize myself, word by word, as I work  through a sentence. The language of my books has shaped me as a man. There's a  moral force in a sentence when it comes out right. It speaks the writer's will  to live....The words typed on the page have a sculptural quality. They form odd  correspondences. They match up not just through meaning but through sound and  look. The rhythm of a sentence will accomodate a certain number of syllables.  One syllable too many, I look for another word. There's always another word  that means the same thing, and if it doesn't then I'll consider altering the  meaing of a sentence to keep the rhythm, the syllable beat. I'm completely  willing to let language press meaning upon me. Watching the way in which words  match up, keeping the balance in a sentence--these are sensuous pleasures. I  type rather than write longhand because I like the way words and letters look  when they come off the hammers onto the page--finished, printed and beautifully  formed.&quot;   Futuristic America-- Brave New  World by Aldous Huxley. How do Huxley's predictions still apply to the world of  clones and bioengineering? Have our values changed since the 1930s? Is  happiness incompatible with art, science, monogamous love and family ties? What  would happen if there were no death? If old age, suffering, weakness and  disease were abolished, would that also mean the end of religion? If everyone  were happy on earth, would we need God? What is your ideal designer baby? If  you could stop aging at 50 and stay the same for the next fifty years, would  you do it? What would happen if everyone did? What do you think of nursing  homes and early retirement? Should people just 'hang out' for thirty years,  living off the state?     At one point in most writers' careers, they tackle the unknown, ineffable and potentially blasphemous task of imagining god and personifying prophets. Like Nikos Kazantzakis, they can be a believing Christian who creates a more sensuous, tormented version of Christ tortured by temptation as he struggles with the demands of divinity. Or they can be like Aldous Huxley as he creates an alternative religion based on a distortion of science, bioengineering, and technology where people worship Our Ford instead of Our Lord. Where is god in books like The Bluest Eye, Lolita, The Sand Child, or The Patience Stone? In Saadawi's books, God often dies (or at least the personification of him or his embodiment in corrupt leaders), or resigns as in her censored play. But in God Resigns at the Summit Meeting , Eve, Bint Allah, and Isis offer humanity alternatives as female deities. Naguib Mahfouz and Salman Rushdie almost lost their lives for personifying Mohammad in Children of Gebelaawi (of the Alley) and Satanic Verses because they made him flawed--a womanizer and a hashish smoker. Where is god in books like The German Mujahid, The Kindly Ones, Night, and If This is a Man? God lets these stories be told but he also didn't stop the holocaust. In Gao Xi Jiang's Soul Mountain , God is a frog with one eye open and one blinking. Savoring the moment of falling snow is as close as we get to paradise.      For a scientific perspective on imagining god, I recommend Alan Lightman's new book Mr. G. Like Einstein's Dreams, this short novel is based on a lifetime of study as a prominent theoretical physicist and in its pithy prose poetry invites us to imagine the creation of our world, our galaxy, and an infinite number of galaxies. I met Lightman at an MIT conference in 2006 where I was invited to give a paper on the personification of particle physics in my narrators in my trilogy of novels published in 2006, now censored by the Dean. MIT was one of the few places that actually understood what I did in my novels, (London, Paris, and Tel Aviv were the others) in part because of the work Lightman has done for years as Humanities and Physics Professor and author of extraordinary compressed, brilliant prose poetry. I personally prefer longer, linguistically complex works, but Lightman is one of the few minimalist writers I adore probably because his intellect is so maximal. Even if you have no time at all because you are so busy with work and school, spend five minutes every night reading a chapter of this book and reflecting on it as you go to sleep. You will get a deeper understanding of science and religion as well as ideas to stimulate your own imagination and sense of wonder. Unlike Joyce and Rushdie, Lightman's writing is simple and clear, but it reflects the same depth of research, understanding, and knowledge, albeit in a different area. Lightman is one of the great writers of our century.

Course objectives are to expand our knowledge   and appreciation of the style and structure of literary works, and to examine   their didactic, aesthetic and entertainment values in terms of the cultural   relativity of world literature.     Classes are a combination of Meatspace   as we bring selected reading to life through oral interpretation and performance;    Deepspace as   we do in-class writing on close textual analysis, subjective interactions and   the relation of our unconscious, dreams, emotions etc. to the reading; and  Cyberspace ,   investigating themes and multidisciplinary issues related to our weekly expository   papers and the final research project. In addition we will design literary web   sites on our chosen topics.

Hell is other people.   Writing and reading...require being alert and ready for unaccountable beauty,   for the intricateness or simple elegance of the writer's imagination, for the   world that imagination evokes. Both require being mindful of the places where   imagination sabotages itself, locks its own gates, pollutes its vision. Writing   and reading mean being aware of the writer's notions of risk and safety, the   serene achievement of, or sweaty fight for, meaning and response-ability.   Whatever may be their use in civilised societies, mirrors are   essential to all violent and heroic action.   Poets are men who refuse to utilize language.   Some say it is best not to go near the center of time. Life   is a vessel of sadness, but it is noble to live life, and without time there   is no life. Others disagree. They would rather have an eternity of contentment,   even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly mounted in a case.   \"Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates success.\"   That is a man's sentence;...it was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman's   use....Moreover a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences   built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been   made by men out of their own needs for their own uses. There is no reason to   think that the form of the epic or the poetic play suits a woman any more than   the sentence suits her. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands--   another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels.   The \"engaged\" writer knows that words are actions.   Writers are among the most sensitive, the most intellectually   anarchic, most representative, most probing of artists. The ability of writers   to imagine what is not the self, to familiarize the strange and mystify the   familiar, is the test of their power. The languages they use and the social   and historical context in which these languages signify are indirect and direct   revelations of that power and its limitations.   Why write? Each one has his reasons: for one, art is a flight;   for another, a means of conquering.   One of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the   need of feeling that we are essential in relation to the world.   All our literature and art are for the masses of the people,   and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created   for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.   ...a great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes   place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all its faculties.   Like a domestic animal, time doesn't move without human beings'   strict supervision.   When the words form under his pen, the author doubtless sees   them, but he does not see them as the reader does, since he knows them before   writing them down. The function of his gaze is not to reveal, by stroking them,   the sleeping words which are waiting to be read, but to control the sketching   of the signs.   What does death matter? Communism is the truth. Because they   appear almost always in conjunction with representations of black or Africanist   people who are dead, impotent, or under complete control, these images of blinding   whiteness seem to function as both antidote for and meditation on the shadow   that is companion to this whiteness-- a dark and abiding presence that moves   the hearts and texts of American literature with fear and longing.   Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images.   Race has become metaphorical-- a way of referring to and disguising   forces, events, classes, and expressions of social decay and economic division   far more threatening to the body politic than biological \"race\" ever was.   It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be   woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress   on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak   consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech for anything written   with that conscious bias is doomed to death. It ceases to be fertilised. ...Some   collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before   the act of creation can be accomplished.   Reading seems, in fact, to be the synthesis of perception and   creation.   In this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time   and there is body time. The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum   of iron that swings back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The second   squirms and wriggles like a bluefish at bay. The first is unyielding, predetermined.   The second makes up its mind as it goes along.... Where the two times meet,   desperation. Where the two times go their separate ways, contentment. ... Each   time is true but the truths are not the same.   There is no romance free of what Herman Melville called \"the   power of blackness,\" especially not in a country in which there was a resident   population, already black, upon which the imagination could play; through which   historical, moral, metaphysical, and social fears, problems, and dichotomies   could be articulated. The slave population, it could be and was assumed, offered   itself up as surrogate selves for meditation on problems of human freedom, its   lure and its elusiveness. This black population was available for meditations   on terror-- the terror of European outcasts, their dread of failure, powerlessness,   Nature without limits, natal loneliness, internal aggression, evil, sin, greed.   In order to know himself, each person carries his own Book   of Life, which is filled with the history of his life. ...With time, each person's   Book of Life thickens until it cannot be read in its entirety....Some have stopped   reading altogether. ... Such people walk with the limber stride of their youth.   Such people have learned how to live in a world without memory.   I fear for you young people because you do not understand how   strong is the bond of kinship. You do not know what it is to speak with one   voice. And what is the result? An abominable religion has settled among you.   A man can now leave his father and his brotheres. He can curse the gods of his   fatheres and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes mad and turns   on his master.

The protagonist and antagonists fight each other with such intensity that the audience experiences a catharsis, or purging of their emotions. In the twentieth and twenty-first century, terrorist attacks have occurred all over the world. No matter how extensive the strike is, the objective is to instill fear in the general public. So when we create literature about terrorist events, do we minimaze or exaggerate the actual events?      Much of twentieth century literature was influenced by Freud, Jung and other psychoanalytic schools. The dreams and unconscious motivations of characters are often more important than their conscious thoughts and actions.      The terrorist novel goes back to the Gothic novels of the late eighteenth century and the Victorian novels about the anarchist movement and the Russian novels by writers like Dostoyevsky as well as Conrad's early work.      Margaret Scanlan wrote a book about plotting terror and it's true that many of these novels are heavily plotted, just like terrorist attacks.      Professor Keefer presented a paper based Part II, Unclashing Civilizations, of her fantasy trilogy, published in 2006 at the Literature and Terrorism conference in London. After the \"cultural caesura\" of 9/11, the world is returning again to the fictional reconstruction of the kind of terrorist attacks that have been occurring all over the world, mainly inspired by extremist Islamist ideologies that distort the traditional concept of jihad for their own aims which do include undermining the hegemony and power of the U.S. and Europe.                      Catharsis                              In an age of terror, how does literature help us transcend our reality, lend perspective to our confusion by pulling us into the past and other cultures, and give expression to our anguish and fear through catharsis? They survived it; so can we. In this course we will define terrorism the way the Arabs define it, as any organized violence, by an individual, group or state, legitimate or illegitimate, against a civilian population, either intentional or unintentional. Because this is about twentieth and twenty first century literature, we will include the two World Wars with All Quiet on the Western Front, Night , No Exit, The Plague (about Algerian terror) as well as the German occupation and natural scourges, to Islamist militant terrorism in Egypt in The Day The Leader Was Killed, Satanic Verses, God Dies by the Nile and War in the Land of Egypt, t o Israeli/Palestinian terror in Martyr's Crossing and Wild Thorns, to the terror of hostage-taking and kidnapping in Mao II, News of a Kidnapping, and The Hostage, to the terror of totalitarian regimes such as China in Red Azalea and Soul Mountain. Black Water is both a personal and stylistic meditation on terror as well as an indirect indictment of the terror a powerful political leader has over an innocent civilian. Because one objective of fiction/drama is to create a combustive drama for the reader's catharsis, literature and terrorism are really competing with each other. Sometimes real life provides so much terror that the reader hides in literature for escape, seeking fantasy, happy endings, funny, harmless stories that eschew the turmoil of an unlivable situation. Often cultures will move through a transformation like New York did after 9/11, moving from the transformation of reality into tragedy with heroic stories, to silly, innocuous escapes, to some social comedy, and finally to stories that deal with fictional terror. No one can take too much of one thing. When New Yorkers were coughing from the smoke and toxins downtown, they did not go to the movies to see sci fi representations of Manhattan blowing up. Enough is enough.         What books give you a catharsis? What books make you want to throw up? What books don't move you at all?                           Literary Representations of Terror                                          But literature is different from film because we can choose when and how often to put the book down. Instead of watching a naturalistic representation, we recreate the story in our minds to excite, soothe or incite us. Many of the writers we will study had personal experience of a world war, the holocaust, the Israeli checkpoints, prison for their writings or gender brutality such as clitorectomies. Some could not write for years afterwards; others wrote on toilet paper in prison. It is significant that terrorism demands a certain amount of intelligence in order to achieve its devastating effect. Formalist agenda about character, plot, style/language, theme, setting/geography, descriptive techniques and narrative point of view must be supplemented and developed to deal with how \"literature engages with contemporary critical understandings of nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, global multiculturalism...\" I would add cyberspace to the list. I also believe that it is stultifying to repress critical reflection on difference to be politically correct. Not only does it make us oblivious to the richness of difference, but we also lose our sense of humor.            Note how spare the language is in Night, Holocaust Survival and Hiroshima mon Amour . In my book, I wanted distressed students to think and laugh and so I exaggerated, twisted, fantasized in an effort to have the reader transcend the horrible reality of 9/11.            What are the degrees of removal from the documentary event? What is the difference between naturalism and realism, fantasy and sci fi, romantic or surreal interpretations? What increases or mitgates the actual terror for you? In my book I wrote a poem about degrees of separation from 9/11, narrated by Shoes, Watch, and Statue of Liberty.                                                                         Psychoanalytic Criticism                                              Psychoanalytic criticism adopts the methods of \"reading\" employed by Freud and later theorists to interpret texts. It argues that literary texts, like dreams, express the secret unconscious desires and anxieties of the author, that a literary work is a manifestation of the author's own neuroses. One may psychoanalyze a particular character within a literary work, but it is usually assumed that all such characters are projections of the author's psyche.       One interesting facet of this approach is that it validates the importance of literature, as it is built on a literary key for the decoding. Freud himself wrote, \"The dream-thoughts which we first come across as we proceed with our analysis often strike us by the unusual form in which they are expressed; they are not clothed in the prosaic language usually employed by our thoughts, but are on the contrary represented symbolically by means of similes and metaphors, in images resembling those of poetic speech\".             Like psychoanalysis itself, this critical endeavor seeks evidence of unresolved emotions, psychological conflicts, guilts, ambivalences, and so forth within what may well be a disunified literary work. The author's own childhood traumas, family life, sexual conflicts, fixations, and such will be traceable within the behavior of the characters in the literary work. But psychological material will be expressed indirectly, disguised, or encoded (as in dreams) through principles such as \"symbolism\" (the repressed object represented in disguise), \"condensation\" (several thoughts or persons represented in a single image), and \"displacement\" (anxiety located onto another image by means of association).             Despite the importance of the author here, psychoanalytic criticism is similar to New Criticism in not concerning itself with \"what the author intended.\" But what the author never intended (that is, repressed) is sought. The unconscious material has been distorted by the censoring conscious mind.             How can you analyze your passage from this point of view?                                     Us versus Them: The Political Implications of Terrorism                                                          After 9/11, President Bush stomped through Near and Central Asia shouting out his war decree of \"us versus them,\" a disjunctive syllogism that wanted the world to choose between the \"legitimate\" power of the American war machine, capable of a nuclear holocaust, and the \"illegitimate power\" of disparate bands of dedicated Islamist \"terrorists,\" armed with box-cutters, knives, and homemade suicide bombs. Since death is death no matter who inflicts it, why are the Al Qaeda operatives branded as terrorists but the American government isn't? If they could establish world dominion, would \"we\" be branded as terrorists?                Since all war inevitably kills the innocent, what makes terrorist events worse? Is it like the Indians hiding in the bushes while the British colonialists marched forthrightly to battle with their guns and flags? If terrorism is about a \"surprise\" attack, then what about the surprise the Japanese felt when the nuclear bomb decimated Hiroshima and their lives for years afterwards?                If terrorism is a deus ex machina for the victims, what does this do to dramatic structure?                If we continue the \"us versus them\" way of thinking, then how can American novelists like Don DeLillo, Andre Dubus III, and John Updike enter the minds of their Islamist characters? Do they succeed and if not, why not? To enter the mind of my antagonist, Jalal Khalifeh, I became friends with a local Egyptian who used to be in the Muslim brotherhood, and then I traveled all over Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey hanging out with locals, going to mosques, and yes, finding Al Qaeda sympathizers. I learned a lot about the good and bad interpretations of Islam and the lifestyle of devout Muslim men in their twenties but I didn't meet a senior-level Al Qaeda terrorist until I met Ibrahim al-Harbi in my father's nursing home in Ottawa who was a well-respected physician and talented poet. When we went out to dinner, he divulged his radical views, and when I invited him to NYC he implied he was on the watch list. A year later he was apprehended in Syria on his way to Iraq and deported to a Saudi Arabian prison. His limp was from the first Afghan war when he was a teenager. Then he became one of the senior operatives and was planning big things from his oasis in Canada when he was caught. This guy was one of the most brilliant people I have ever met anywhere so although terrorists may use poor people, I am not sure the 21st century terrorism is fueled by that. He hated thepolitical, economic, military, and cultural hegemony of the U.S., what Israel did and does to Palestine, and what European colonialists did to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. He was fighting his own \"us versus them,\" and he was prepared to die for his beliefs like all the other Islamists. It took a lot of courage for me to get inside his head but unfortunately I met him after my book was published! Certainly DeLillo, Updike, and Dubus didn't go through what I went through but they are excellent writers who depict the victims' point of view with sensitivity and perception.                        How do the real-world political conflicts affect the seesaw of dramatic structure in the books you are using? Can an author create the total humanity of a 9/11 hijacker? Are 9/11 novels wrapped in a cocoon of narcissism?         It took great courage to write against the fascist governments of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and Communist China. Based on utopias, deluded thinking, and/or distorted applications of Marxist thinking, these totalitarian governments ironically inspired creativity from their constraints, at least in the beginning. Once those writers were censored, imprisoned, and/or exiled, the dry periods began. But each country is different. While Mao's China fostered a kind of women's liberation with the appointment of female military officers, the librettos of the Peking Revolutionary Opera that turned women into heroes, protection against sexual harassment, and equal rights, the Soviet Union maintained women in subservient roles, and there appears to be an absence or idealization of women in much holocaust literature. Nazi Germany spent a lot of time burning books, and people, and Hitler was a frustrated artist who turned his insanity into genocide, but the Soviet Union had its own kind of realist art and film, and Mao and his wife created beautiful, colorful revolutionary operas, combining ballet, acrobatics, classical opera music, and women's liberation with Marxist plots. Because my father and brother spent a lot of time in Mao's China, I have original versions of most of these operas. Even Anchee Min loved them--at first.                 In order to provoke deeper thinking and help you contribute to your Wikis, imagine that you not free-thinking Westerners but members of these communities, trying to see the appeal of their rhetoric at first. In this Rogerian way of understanding oppositional counterclaims, we can better analyze how and why these fascist governments were successful.                 Fascism also occurs all over Latin America and in many countries in Africa and Asia. But as I said before, we have courses devoted exclusively to Latin American and African literature, so I focus on the major writers of North America, the U.K., the Maghreb and Middle East, China, India, Russia, and Europe. To really understand the literary movements of each of these places, you would need to concentrate on minor and major writers, history, and literary theory.                          Just as it is important to know Chairman Mao's Peking Revolutionary Opera to understand what writers like Gao Xingjian, Anchee Min and Dai Sijie were up against, it is also critical to examine Stalin's program of socialist realism.          The theory    of Socialist Realism was adopted by the Congress of Soviet Writers    in 1934. Approved by Joseph Stalin , Nickolai    Bukharin , Maxim Gorky and Andrey    Zhdanov , Socialist Realism demanded that all art must depict some    aspect of man's struggle toward socialist progress for a better life.    It stressed the need for the creative artist to serve the proletariat    by being realistic, optimistic and heroic. The doctrine considered    all forms of experimentalism as degenerate and pessimistic. The writings of Tolstoi and Dostoyevsky, that depicted the despair in all of us, were banned. Throughout history, we see that when new leaders create new governments, especially through revolution, they seek to control the intellectual and artistic as well as the socio-economic lives of their people. If they fail to do this, the revolution might not succeed.                   Experimental    and non-conformist writers such as Yevgeni    Zamyatin , Isaac Babel , Boris    Pilnyak , Nickolai Tikhonov , Mikhail    Slonimski , Vsevolod Ivanov , Victor    Serge , Vladimir Mayakovsky , Sergei    Yesenin , Konstantin Fedin , Victor    Shklovsky , Mikhail Zoshchenko and Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered    under this policy. Zamyatin and Serge managed to leave the country,    whereas Mayakovsky and Yesenin committed suicide. Writers who refused    to change, such as Babel and Pilnyak, were executed or died in labour    camps.                   Compare and Contrast our 4 Writers:                    Even though most of you will be reading in translation, note the different styles of these four writers. Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize. While Pasternak's style is more poetic, in fact he was a poet, Solzhenitsyn thrives on a naturalistic style that gives a documentary feel to his horrors. If possible, read the 2010 translation of Dr. Zhivago by award-winning translators Richard Pevea r and Larissa Volokhonsky , noted for their versions of War and Peace and Anna Karenina. I met them at the 92nd St Y and was very impressed with their work. Dr, Zhivago was first published in 1957 in Italy and was banned in the soviet Union until 1988. The 1958 english edition of Zhivago was hastily produced for Pasternak's upcoming Nobel Peace Prize, which he declined due to extreme pressure form the Soviet government. Reviewers have said that the new version shows more of the nuances of the original Russian text and will reveal a better understanding of Pasternak's style and the Soviet Union during the 20th century.Ayn Rand and Bulgakov have opposite styles: contrast her straightforward, minimal style, which she ironically censored in Anthem to conform to American mass market taste, with the magical realism of Bulgakov's Master and Margarita, a wild ride that influenced Rushdie's Satanic Verses.                    Boris Leonidovich Pasternak (1890-1960), born in Moscow, was the son of talented artists: his father a painter and illustrator of Tolstoy's works, his mother a well-known concert pianist. Pasternak's education began in a German Gymnasium in Moscow and was continued at the University of Moscow. Under the influence of the composer Scriabin, Pasternak took up the study of musical composition for six years from 1904 to 1910. By 1912 he had renounced music as his calling in life and went to the University of Marburg, Germany, to study philosophy. After four months there and a trip to Italy, he returned to Russia and decided to dedicate himself to literature.                   Pasternak's first books of verse went unnoticed. With Sestra moya zhizn (My Sister Life), 1922, and Temy i variatsii (Themes and Variations), 1923, the latter marked by an extreme, though sober style, Pasternak first gained a place as a leading poet among his Russian contemporaries. In 1924 he published Vysokaya bolezn (Sublime Malady), which portrayed the 1905 revolt as he saw it, and Detstvo Lyuvers (The Childhood of Luvers), a lyrical and psychological depiction of a young girl on the threshold of womanhood. A collection of four short stories was published the following year under the title Vozdushnye puti (Aerial Ways). In 1927 Pasternak again returned to the revolution of 1905 as a subject for two long works: Leytenant Shmidt , a poem expressing threnodic sorrow for the fate of Lieutenant Schmidt, the leader of the mutiny at Sevastopol, and Devyatsot pyaty god (The Year 1905), a powerful but diffuse poem which concentrates on the events related to the revolution of 1905. Pasternak's reticent autobiography, Okhrannaya gramota (Safe Conduct), appeared in 1931, and was followed the next year by a collection of lyrics, Vtoroye rozhdenie (Second Birth), 1932. In 1935 he published translations of some Georgian poets and subsequently translated the major dramas of Shakespeare, several of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, and Ben Jonson, and poems by Pet&ouml;fi, Verlaine, Swinburne, Shelley, and others. Na rannikh poyezdakh (In Early Trains), a collection of poems written since 1936, was published in 1943 and enlarged and reissued in 1945 as Zemnye prostory (Wide Spaces of the Earth). In 1957 Doktor Zhivago , Pasternak's only novel - except for the earlier \"novel in verse\", Spektorsky (1926) - first appeared in an Italian translation and has been acclaimed by some critics as a successful attempt at combining lyrical-descriptive and epic-dramatic styles. An autobiographical sketch, Biografichesky ocherk (An Essay in Autobiography), was published in 1959, first in Italian, and subsequently in English. Pasternak lived in Peredelkino, near Moscow, until his death in 1960.                         Boris Pasternak died on May 30, 1960.                    Although it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, Doctor Zhivago was not completed until 1956. The novel was submitted to the journal \"&#1053;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;&#1081; &#1052;&#1080;&#1088;\" (Novy Mir, Russian for both New World and New Peace ) and rejected because Pasternak's political viewpoint was opposed by the Soviet authorities. [2] The author, like Zhivago, showed more concern with the welfare of individuals than with the welfare of society. Soviet censors construed some passages as anti- Marxist . There are implied criticisms of Stalinism and references to prison camps. In 1957, the Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli smuggled the book manuscript out of the Soviet Union thanks to Isaiah Berlin and simultaneously published editions in both Russian and Italian in Milan , Italy. It was published in English (translated from Russian by Manya Harari and Max Hayward ) the next year and was eventually published in a total of eighteen different languages. The publication of this novel was partly responsible for Pasternak's being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. The Soviet government asked the committee not to award him the prize. Pasternak was pressured by Soviet authorities to reject the Nobel Prize in order to prevent a scandal in the Soviet Union [3] . Pasternak died on 30 May 1960, of natural causes.           Doctor Zhivago was finally published in the Soviet Union in 1988, in the pages of Novy mir , although earlier samizdat editions existed.          Yuri Zhivago is sensitive and poetic nearly to the point of mysticism . Zhivago's idealism and principles stand in contrast to the brutality and horror of World War I , the Russian Revolution , and the subsequent Russian Civil War . A major theme of the novel is how mysticism and idealism are destroyed by both the Bolsheviks and the White Army alike, as both sides commit horrible atrocities. Yuri witnesses dismemberment and other horrors suffered by the innocent civilian population during the turmoil. Even the love of his life, Lara, is taken from him.          Zhivago ponders how war can turn the whole world senseless, and make an otherwise reasonable group of people destroy each other with no regard for life. His journey through Russia has an epic, dreamlike, almost surreal feeling. He travels through a world which is in such striking contrast to himself, relatively uncorrupted by violence. His desire to find a place away from it all drives him across the Arctic Siberia of Russia, and eventually back to Moscow. Pasternak subtly criticizes of Soviet ideology: he disagrees with the idea of \"building a new man,\" which, he suggests, is against nature.          His great love's life is also dealt with in considerable detail. Lara, whose full name is Larissa Feodorovna Guishar (later Antipova), born into the bourgeoisie, is engaged to Pavel \"Pasha\" Antipov, an idealistic young student who becomes involved in Bolshevism through his father. Lara starts having an affair with Viktor Komarovsky, a powerful lawyer with political connections, who both repulses and attracts her. To gain independence from Komarovsky, Lara spends three years working as a live-in nanny for a wealthy family (the Kologrivovs). Upon returning, Lara's brother begs her to get 700 rubles from Komarovsky to repay money that he has gambled away. Lara gets the money from her generous employer, Kologrivov. However, when her pupil Lipa graduates, she feels like she is on charity instead of working for her keep in the Kologrivov household. She decides that Komarovsky \"owes her.\" She attends a party to demand the money from Komarovsky. But he spends the evening playing cards and pays her no attention. She finally walks in and attempts to shoot him but misses. [4]          Lara and Zhivago have a number of brief encounters before truly meeting. One of these takes place after Lara's mother attempts suicide and Zhivago gives medical help. Zhivago also sees Lara at the Christmas party where she tries to shoot Komarovsky. Lara and Zhivago have their first real conversation after a roadside encounter between First World War troop columns: a miserable troop of retreating Russian Army deserters and new recruits bound for the hopeless conditions at the Front. Lara has been serving as nurse while searching for her assumed-dead husband Antipov. Lara and Zhivago serve together in a makeshift field hospital and fall in love. They do not consummate their relationship until much later, meeting in the town of Yuriatin after the war.          Pasha Antipov and Komarovsky continue to play important roles in the story. Pasha is assumed killed in World War I, but is actually captured by the Germans and escapes. Pasha Antipov joins the Bolsheviks and becomes Strelnikov (the shooter), a fearsome Red Army general who becomes infamous for executing White prisoners (hence his nickname). However, he is never a true Bolshevik and yearns for the fighting to be over so he can return to Lara. (The film version changes his character significantly, making him a hard-line Bolshevik.)          Another major character is Liberius, commander of the \"Forest Brotherhood\", the Red Partisan band which conscripts Yuri into service. Liberius is a dedicated and heroic revolutionary. But he is also a cocaine addict, loud-mouthed and vain, and bores Yuri with his constant lectures about the justice of their cause and the inevitability of their victory.          Komarovsky reappears towards the end of the story. He has gained some influence in the Bolshevik government and been appointed minister of justice of the Far Eastern Republic , a Bolshevik puppet state in Siberia. He offers Zhivago and Lara transit out of Russia. They initially refuse. But Komarovsky lies about Pasha Antipov's death and persuades Zhivago that it is in Lara's best interests to leave; Zhivago convinces Lara to go with Komarovsky, telling her (falsely) that he will follow her shortly.          Meanwhile, Antipov/Strelnikov falls from grace, loses his position in the Red Army, and returns to Varykino , near Yuriatin, where he hopes to find Lara. She, however, has just left with Komarovsky. After having a lengthy conversation with Zhivago, Pasha Antipov commits suicide and is found the next morning by Zhivago. (In the movie Komarovsky tells Zhivago that he was captured 5 miles outside of Yuriatin and on the way to his execution he grabbed a pistol from a guard and killed himself.)          Zhivago's life and health go downhill after this; he lives with another woman and has two children with her, plans numerous writing projects but does not finish them, and is increasingly absent-minded, erratic, and unwell. Lara eventually returns to Russia on the day of Zhivago's funeral. She gets Yevgraf, his half brother, to try to find her daughter but then disappears.          During World War II Zhivago's old friends Nika Dudorov and Misha Gordon meet up. One of their discussions revolves around a local laundress named Tanya, a bezprizornaya or parentless child, one of many left by the Civil War, and her resemblance to Zhivago. Much later they meet over the first edition of Zhivago's poems.          Other major characters include Tonya Gromeko, Zhivago's wife, and her parents Alexander and Anna, with whom Zhivago lived after he lost his parents as a child. Yevgraf (Evgraf) Zhivago, Yuri's younger illegitimate half-brother (son of his father and a Mongolian princess), is a mysterious figure who gains power and influence with the Bolsheviks and helps his brother evade arrest throughout the course of the story.          The book is packed full of odd coincidences; characters disappear and reappear seemingly at random, encountering each other in the most unlikely places.          The Russian Revolution was at its core an ideological struggle, forcing young and old alike to align themselves or risk extermination . Its uncompromising nature put great strain on the ideals of individual thought and choice, represented in Yuri Zhivago's constant attempts to come to terms with the Revolution. Yuri is the ultimate individual, expressing himself through poetry and recognizing beauty in all aspects of life. He is frequently overcome by emotion, and is deeply introspective . His affair with Lara was primarily fueled by passion and romanticism. However, he gradually realizes that his commitment to own unique philosophy is rapidly becoming untenable in the face of a crystallizing Soviet ideology. His attempts to exert control over his own individual self end in futility: in one pivotal scene, he wounds and possibly kills several White soldiers despite his best efforts avoid doing so. The taking of lives is a betrayal of his personal core beliefs, and Yuri is horrified and demoralized by the incident. Ultimately, the revolution's refusal to acknowledge the fundamental nature of the individual ensured that regardless of which faction Yuri sided with, he would not be able to survive in the new Soviet era as a true individual.          When he was younger, Zhivago enjoyed having political discussions with educated people, like his uncle Nicholai. Zhivago's views were relatively neutral&mdash;though not a revolutionary zealot , he recognized that Russia needed serious reform. As the story progresses, however, Zhivago realizes that many political activists simply parrot the ideas they have heard, reciting their memorized lines in order to seem intellectual. Still others actively seek power for themselves, taking advantage of the people's thirst for betterment by promising more than they intended to deliver. Pasternak shows what he thought went wrong in the revolution: that initially, revolutionary leaders had good ideas, but because of human failings these ideas were warped or even forgotten as the revolution progressed. Pasternak's strategy to convey this point is to introduce seemingly obvious villains into the plot, but show that in the context of the entire novel, the results of their bad behavior pales in comparison to the harm caused by the corrupted revolutionary effort. Komarovsky and Strelnikov are both antagonists in the sense that they cause harm to other characters in the book, but Pasternak cleverly uses them to show that their damage was temporary and relatively minor, whereas the trauma and suffering caused by the misled train wreck of the revolution was more permanent, often fatal, and certainly more devastating to Russian society.                    Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn          I was born at Kislovodsk on 11th December, 1918. My father had studied philological subjects at Moscow University, but did not complete his studies, as he enlisted as a volunteer when war broke out in 1914. He became an artillery officer on the German front, fought throughout the war and died in the summer of 1918, six months before I was born. I was brought up by my mother, who worked as a shorthand-typist, in the town of Rostov on the Don, where I spent the whole of my childhood and youth, leaving the grammar school there in 1936. Even as a child, without any prompting from others, I wanted to be a writer and, indeed, I turned out a good deal of the usual juvenilia. In the 1930s, I tried to get my writings published but I could not find anyone willing to accept my manuscripts. I wanted to acquire a literary education, but in Rostov such an education that would suit my wishes was not to be obtained. To move to Moscow was not possible, partly because my mother was alone and in poor health, and partly because of our modest circumstances. I therefore began to study at the Department of Mathematics at Rostov University, where it proved that I had considerable aptitude for mathematics. But although I found it easy to learn this subject, I did not feel that I wished to devote my whole life to it. Nevertheless, it was to play a beneficial role in my destiny later on, and on at least two occasions, it rescued me from death. For I would probably not have survived the eight years in camps if I had not, as a mathematician, been transferred to a so-called sharashia , where I spent four years; and later, during my exile, I was allowed to teach mathematics and physics, which helped to ease my existence and made it possible for me to write. If I had had a literary education it is quite likely that I should not have survived these ordeals but would instead have been subjected to even greater pressures. Later on, it is true, I began to get some literary education as well; this was from 1939 to 1941, during which time, along with university studies in physics and mathematics, I also studied by correspondence at the Institute of History, Philosophy and Literature in Moscow.                    In 1941, a few days before the outbreak of the war, I graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Rostov University. At the beginning of the war, owing to weak health, I was detailed to serve as a driver of horsedrawn vehicles during the winter of 1941-1942. Later, because of my mathematical knowledge, I was transferred to an artillery school, from which, after a crash course, I passed out in November 1942. Immediately after this I was put in command of an artillery-position-finding company, and in this capacity, served, without a break, right in the front line until I was arrested in February 1945. This happened in East Prussia, a region which is linked with my destiny in a remarkable way. As early as 1937, as a first-year student, I chose to write a descriptive essay on \"The Samsonov Disaster\" of 1914 in East Prussia and studied material on this; and in 1945 I myself went to this area (at the time of writing, autumn 1970, the book August 1914 has just been completed).                    I was arrested on the grounds of what the censorship had found during the years 1944-45 in my correspondence with a school friend, mainly because of certain disrespectful remarks about Stalin, although we referred to him in disguised terms. As a further basis for the \"charge\", there were used the drafts of stories and reflections which had been found in my map case. These, however, were not sufficient for a \"prosecution\", and in July 1945 I was \"sentenced\" in my absence, in accordance with a procedure then frequently applied, after a resolution by the OSO (the Special Committee of the NKVD), to eight years in a detention camp (at that time this was considered a mild sentence).                    I served the first part of my sentence in several correctional work camps of mixed types (this kind of camp is described in the play, The Tenderfoot and the Tramp ). In 1946, as a mathematician, I was transferred to the group of scientific research institutes of the MVD-MOB (Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of State Security). I spent the middle period of my sentence in such \"SPECIAL PRISONS\" ( The First Circle ). In 1950 I was sent to the newly established \"Special Camps\" which were intended only for political prisoners. In such a camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan ( One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich ), I worked as a miner, a bricklayer, and a foundryman. There I contracted a tumour which was operated on, but the condition was not cured (its character was not established until later on).                    One month after I had served the full term of my eight-year sentence, there came, without any new judgement and even without a \"resolution from the OSO\", an administrative decision to the effect that I was not to be released but EXILED FOR LIFE to Kok-Terek (southern Kazakhstan). This measure was not directed specially against me, but was a very usual procedure at that time. I served this exile from March 1953 (on March 5th, when Stalin's death was made public, I was allowed for the first time to go out without an escort) until June 1956. Here my cancer had developed rapidly, and at the end of 1953, I was very near death. I was unable to eat, I could not sleep and was severely affected by the poisons from the tumour. However, I was able to go to a cancer clinic at Tashkent, where, during 1954, I was cured ( The Cancer Ward, Right Hand ). During all the years of exile, I taught mathematics and physics in a primary school and during my hard and lonely existence I wrote prose in secret (in the camp I could only write down poetry from memory). I managed, however, to keep what I had written, and to take it with me to the European part of the country, where, in the same way, I continued, as far as the outer world was concerned, to occupy myself with teaching and, in secret, to devote myself to writing, at first in the Vladimir district ( Matryona's Farm ) and afterwards in Ryazan.                    During all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared that this would become known. Finally, at the age of 42, this secret authorship began to wear me down. The most difficult thing of all to bear was that I could not get my works judged by people with literary training. In 1961, after the 22nd Congress of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party and Tvardovsky's speech at this, I decided to emerge and to offer One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich .                    Such an emergence seemed, then, to me, and not without reason, to be very risky because it might lead to the loss of my manuscripts, and to my own destruction. But, on that occasion, things turned out successfully, and after protracted efforts, A.T. Tvardovsky was able to print my novel one year later. The printing of my work was, however, stopped almost immediately and the authorities stopped both my plays and (in 1964) the novel, The First Circle , which, in 1965, was seized together with my papers from the past years. During these months it seemed to me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake by revealing my work prematurely and that because of this I should not be able to carry it to a conclusion.                    It is almost always impossible to evaluate at the time events which you have already experienced, and to understand their meaning with the guidance of their effects. All the more unpredictable and surprising to us will be the course of future events.                                    Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940)                    Russian journalist, playwright, novelist, and short story writer, whose major work was the Gogolesque fantasy The Master and Margarita . In the story the Devil visits Stalinist Moscow to see if he can do some good. The book is considered a major Russian novel of the 20th century. It first appeared in a censored form in the Soviet journal Moskva in 1966-67. Bulgakov used satire and fantasy also in his other works, among them the short story collection Diaboliad (1925).           It was hard to say exactly what had made Bezdomny write as he had--whether it was his great talent for graphic description or complete ignorance of the subject he was writing on, but his Jesus had come out, well, completely alive, a Jesus who had really existed, although admittedly a Jesus who had every possible fault.\"            (from The Master and Margarita )           Mihail Bulgakov was born in Kiev, Ukraine, the eldest son of a theology professor at the Kiev Theological Academy. After attending First Kiev High School (1900-09), Bulgakov studied medicine at the Kiev University (1909-16). From 1916 to 1918 he served as a doctor in front-line and district hospitals. These experiences he described in notes of a young doctor, 'Zapiski yunogo vracha' (1925-26).           In 1918-19 Bulgakov worked as a doctor in Kiev, and witnessed the German occupation and then the occupation by the Red Army. During these war years he used a morphine, but with the helped of his first wife he managed to win the addiction. In 1920 Bulgakov abandoned medicine in favor of a career as a writer. He organized in Vladikavkaz, Caucasus, a 'sub-department of the arts', wrote stories for newspapers           Bulgakov moved in 1921 to Moskow, where he worked for the literary department of the People's Commissariat of Education, and wrote as a journalist for various groups and papers. His largely autobiographical novel BELAYA GVARDIYA (1925, full text 1973, The White Guard) was an account of the turbulent years between 1914 and 1921 as reflected in the lives of a White family in the Ukraine. Two parts of the book was published in the journal Rossiya , which was closed before the third part could appear. Bulgakov abandoned his plans for a trilogy; the proofs of the new ending surfaced in 1987, but the final pages were missing.           From 1925 Bulgakov was associated with the Moscow Arts Theatre. He wrote and staged many plays, which enjoyed great popularity. Bulgakov's criticism of the Soviet system was not swallowed by the authorities. The Heart of the Dog (written in 1925), a satire on Soviet life in the guise of science fiction, was condemned unpublishable. In the story 'Pokhozhdenia Chichikova' the protaginist of Gogol's Dead Souls was dropped in the middle of the Soviet Russia's New Economic Policy period of 1921-27. 'Diaboliad' (1925) portrayed a poor clerk in a gigantic bureaucracy, where he loses his identity and life.           In 1928 Bulgakov had three plays running in three Moscow theatres, Zoya's Apartment , The Crimson Island , and The Days of the Turbins , dramatized from his novel The White Guard . It brought the author overnight success and became 'a new Seagull ' for the new generation, although it also received hostile reviews for the sympathetic portrayal of White officers. Paradoxically, The White Guard was one of Stalin's favorite plays. It was banned in 1929, reinstated in 1932 but not published until 1955.           By 1930s Bulgakov's works were published rarely or not at all - Zoya's Apartment (1926), a play set in an atelier-bordello, was banned, as The Crimson Island (1928). Flight (1928), dealing with White fugitives leaving Russia, was banned before its premiere. In 1929 he wrote to Maxim Gorky: \"All my plays have been banned; not a line of mine is being printed anywhere; I have no work ready, and not a kopeck of royalties is coming in from any source; not a single institution, not a single individual will reply to my applications...\"           After writing a letter to Soviet government, requesting permission to emigrate, Bulgakov received a personal telephone call from Stalin and was employed as an assistant producer with the Moscow Arts Theatre. He adapted classics for the stage. During the late 1930s he was librettist and consultant at Bolshoi Theatre. However, Stalin's favour protected Bulgakov only from arrests and executions, but his writings remained unpublished. In Black Snow, a Theatrical Novel , Bulgakov described his love-hate relationship and took a revenge on Stanislavsky for the failure of his play A Cabal of Hypocrites , produced under the title Moli&egrave;re . In one scene Louis XIV, the Sun King, says: \"Then hear this: my author is oppressed. He is frightened. I will show kindness to anyone who forewarns me of whatever danger imperils him... The ban is lifted. You may stage Tartuffe .\" The Last Days was performed first in 1943 under the title Pushkin . Bulgakov's stage version of Gogol's Dead Souls had a modest success.           Bulgakov's most important work was The Master and Margarita , a fantasy about the Devil, disguised as a professor, who causes havoc in the city. The work was suppressed because Bulgakov refused to make the changes reguired by the authorities. Although Bulgakov worked still on the text on his death bed, the novel was completed. The first Soviet edition was published in 1966-67, a fuller text appeared in 1973 and the revised full text in 1989.           The Master and Margarita (1928-40). Published in installments in 1966 and 1967 in the journal Moskva . The large novel takes place on three levels, each of which provides a commentary on the others. Historical narrative is set in Jerusalem, where Pontius Pilate condemns to death a man, Jeshua, whom he knows to be innocent. Contemporary narrative is set in Moscow, in the 1930s, where the Master and Margarita live and where the Master has written a novel about Pilate. The third, fantastic level introduces the devil, who steps out of Goethe's Faust. He appears in Moscow with a retinue that includes an enormous black cat. The devil, Woland, is unconventionally seen as a relatively sympathetic figure, Righteous Man in Sodom. Moreover, the character of Jesus, called Yeshua, in not very Biblical. The philosophical and religious themes and examination of the freedom of art circulate around the intrusion of the devil into the life of modern Moscow and the crucifixion of Christ. Interacting and competing discourses from the realms of science, religion, literature, history, and politics, complicate further the narrative. Master burns his manuscript and retires to a madhouse. Margarita's love for the master drives her to a pact with Satan. However, \"manuscripts don't burn\" and Woland defends the existence of Jeshua.            Bulgakov composed two versions of the work. One was written at home and another, when he did not have the original available, was born while he was living with a mistress. Much of the the satire is aimed at greed, vanity, and pettiness, but is possible to read the book as a tribute to Stalin's policy to cut the bourgeois elements of Soviet society. After the publication Bulgakov was seen as a link between such writers as Vasilii Aksenov, Andrei Siniavskii, and the Strugatskii brothers, and the great past tradition of Gogol and Dostoevskii.           Bulgakov was married three times: with Tatiana Nikolaevna Lappa (1913), Liubov Evgenevna Belozerskaia (1924), and Elena Sergeevna Shilovskaya (1932), who gave invaluable support to the author when he wrote The Master and Margarita and had his fits of paranoia. Bulgakov was writing Black Snow , his theatre novel, when he died in Moskow on March 10, 1940. It took until the 1980s before all Bulgakov's works could be printed in his own home country. For decades Bulgakov was considered an outsider and the most \"un-Soviet\" writer. Supernatural and occult attracted him, and he used sudden cuts into the fantastic and mockery. Although he was subjected to a number of restrictions as a writer, he survived attacks from the officials, when others were imprisoned and perished in the 'Gulag Archipelago'.                   Ayn Rand                    Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. At age six she taught herself to read and two years later discovered her first fictional hero in a French magazine for children, thus capturing the heroic vision which sustained her throughout her life. At the age of nine, she decided to make fiction writing her career. Thoroughly opposed to the mysticism and collectivism of Russian culture, she thought of herself as a European writer, especially after encountering Victor Hugo, the writer she most admired.                    During her high school years, she was eyewitness to both the Kerensky Revolution, which she supported, and&mdash;in 1917&mdash;the Bolshevik Revolution, which she denounced from the outset. In order to escape the fighting, her family went to the Crimea, where she finished high school. The final Communist victory brought the confiscation of her father's pharmacy and periods of near-starvation. When introduced to American history in her last year of high school, she immediately took America as her model of what a nation of free men could be.           When her family returned from the Crimea, she entered the University of Petrograd to study philosophy and history . Graduating in 1924, she experienced the disintegration of free inquiry and the takeover of the university by communist thugs. Amidst the increasingly gray life, her greatest pleasures were Viennese operettas and Western films and plays. Long an admirer of cinema, she entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting. It was at this time that she was first published: a booklet on actress Pola Negri (1925) and a booklet titled &ldquo;Hollywood: American Movie City&rdquo; (1926), both reprinted in 1999 in Russian Writings on Hollywood .           In late 1925 she obtained permission to leave Soviet Russia for a visit to relatives in the United States. Although she told Soviet authorities that her visit would be short, she was determined never to return to Russia. She arrived in New York City in February 1926. She spent the next six months with her relatives in Chicago, obtained an extension to her visa, and then left for Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter.           On Ayn Rand&rsquo;s second day in Hollywood, Cecil B. DeMille saw her standing at the gate of his studio, offered her a ride to the set of his movie The King of Kings, and gave her a job, first as an extra, then as a script reader. During the next week at the studio, she met an actor, Frank O&rsquo;Connor, whom she married in 1929; they were married until his death fifty years later.           After struggling for several years at various nonwriting jobs, including one in the wardrobe department at the RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she sold her first screenplay, &ldquo;Red Pawn,&rdquo; to Universal Pictures in 1932 and saw her first stage play, Night of January 16th , produced in Hollywood and then on Broadway. Her first novel, We the Living , was completed in 1934 but was rejected by numerous publishers, until The Macmillan Company in the United States and Cassells and Company in England published the book in 1936. The most autobiographical of her novels, it was based on her years under Soviet tyranny.           She began writing The Fountainhead in 1935 (taking a short break in 1937 to write the anti-collectivist novelette Anthem ). In the character of the architect Howard Roark, she presented for the first time the kind of hero whose depiction was the chief goal of her writing: the ideal man , man as &ldquo;he could be and ought to be.&rdquo; The Fountainhead was rejected by twelve publishers but finally accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company. When published in 1943, it made history by becoming a best-seller through word of mouth two years later, and gained for its author lasting recognition as a champion of individualism.           Ayn Rand returned to Hollywood in late 1943 to write the screenplay for The Fountainhead , but wartime restrictions delayed production until 1948. Working part time as a screenwriter for Hal Wallis Productions, she began her major novel Atlas Shrugged , in 1946. In 1951 she moved back to New York City and devoted herself full time to the completion of Atlas Shrugged.           Published in 1957, Atlas Shrugged was her greatest achievement and last work of fiction. In this novel she dramatized her unique philosophy in an intellectual mystery story that integrated ethics , metaphysics , epistemology , politics , economics and sex . Although she considered herself primarily a fiction writer, she realized that in order to create heroic fictional characters, she had to identify the philosophic principles which make such individuals possible.           Thereafter, Ayn Rand wrote and lectured on her philosophy&mdash; Objectivism , which she characterized as &ldquo;a philosophy for living on earth.\" She published and edited her own periodicals from 1962 to 1976, her essays providing much of the material for six books on Objectivism and its application to the culture . Ayn Rand died on March 6, 1982, in her New York City apartment.           Every book by Ayn Rand published in her lifetime is still in print, and hundreds of thousands of copies are sold each year, so far totaling more than 25 million. Several new volumes have been published posthumously. Her vision of man and her philosophy for living on earth have changed the lives of thousands of readers and launched a philosophic movement with a growing impact on American culture.                     This includes Everything is Illuminated, All Quiet on the Western Front, Night, Holocaust Survival, The German Mujahid (revisited) and the Kindly Ones if you are ambitious.                     Jonathan Safran Foer is currently a professor of creative writing at NYU.          Everything is Illuminated was Foer's first novel published in 2002 when he was in his twenties and so it was considered a work of precocious genius. It chronicles a young, Jewish-American writer's attempt to research his grandfather's life in Ukraine. Jonathan, who has the same name as the book's author, is attempting to find his grandfather's shtetl, Trachimbrod. He has only a few maps and a photograph of a woman named Augustine, who is said to have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Jonathan's guide on his trip is Alex, a young Ukrainian man. They are both twenty-one. Their driver is Alex's grandfather, who claims to be blind. Accompanying the men is Grandfather's seeing-eye dog Sammy Davis Junior, Junior. The novel is comprised by three basic narratives: chapters written by Jonathan, chapters written by Alex, and letters from Alex to Jonathan. Chapters written by Jonathan describe different events in his family's history in Trachimbrod. Chapters written by Alex describe Jonathan's present trip. Letters from Alex to Jonathan reveal the two characters' growing relationship as writers and friends. This book has Safran Foer's unique postmodern style, distorting language to fit narrators even if it means ESL grammar, typographical innovations, and non-linear sequencing.           Although unconfirmed by Foer, it is speculated that the title of the book is an inspiration from a line in the novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera: 'In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia.'                     Remarque 1898-1970                     German writer, who became famous with his novel IM WESTEN NICHTS NEUES (tr. All Quiet on the Western Front , 1929), which depicted the horrors of war from the point of view of the ordinary soldiers. In his works Remarque focused largely on the collapse of the old European world and values. Although his later novels also were successful, Remarque lived in the shadow of his \"big\" first book.           \"It is just as much a matter of chance that I am still alive as that I might have been hit. In a bomb-proof dug-out I may be smashed to atoms and in the open may survive ten hour's bombardment unscratched. No soldier outlives a thousand chances. But every soldier believes in Chance and trusts his luck.\" (from All Quiet on the Western Front )           Erich Maria Remarque was born in Osnabr&uuml;ck, Lower Saxony, into modest circumstances. His ancestors were French, the family name was 'Germanized' early in the nineteeth century. Peter Franz Remark, Remarque's father, was a poorly paid bookbinder. Although Franz Remark did not show much interest in intellectual activities, except his interest in the occult, the family had a piano, and at one point in his life Remarque planned a musical career. In 1904, at the age of six, Remarque entered the Domschule (cathedral school), and four years later he moved to the Johannisschle. Remarque was \"always the best in class\", as one of his closest school friends later recalled.           For a time Remarque studied at the University of M&uuml;nster, but had to enlist in the German army at the age of 18. Remarque fought on the Western Front and was wounded several times. After his discharge Remarque had taken a teacher's course offered to veterans by the government. He taught for a year in a school, and tried also his hand as a stonecutter and a test-cardriver for a Berlin tire company.           Remarque began his writing career as a sporting journalist, eventually becoming the assistant editor of Sportbild . Among his friends was Leni Riefenstahl, who later made the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will (1935), and the two-part Olympia (1938), about the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. Remarque's wife, Jutta Zambona, \"tall, slender as a fashion model, and strikingly dressed\", as Riefenstahl described Jutta in her book of memoir later inspired heroines in his books. The marriage was stormy, and they both had extra-marital activities. His longest, intercontinental affair Remarque had with Marlene Dietrich; they met first time in Venice in the late 1930s.           Fame came with Remarque's first novel, All Quiet on the Westerns Front, which touched a nerve of the time, and sparkled off a storm of political controversy. The book, which first had been rejected by one publisher, sold 1.2 million copies in its first year. H.L. Mencken called it \"unquestionably the best story of the World War.\" Its sequel, DER WEG ZUR&Uuml;CK ( The Way Back ), appeared in 1931. It dealt with the collapse of the German Army after the war, and the fate of the surviving heroes, Ernst and his friends.           All Quiet on the Western Front is the most famous novel dealing with World War I. The book starts in 1917 after a battle, in which half of Paul B&auml;umer's company has been killed. B&auml;umer is mostly the narrator and Remarque goes through his life in flashbacks. Paul and his classmates have been encouraged by their teacher, Kantorek, to enlist the German army. B&auml;umer's group includes some school fellows, and Katczinsky, an older man. The group goes through basic training and go to the front. B&auml;umer tries to understand what is going on. He realizes that back home \"no one had the vaguest idea what we were in for. The wisest were just the poor and simple people. They knew the war to be a misfortune, whereas those who were better off, and should have been able to see more clearly what the consequences would be, were beside themselves with joy.\" Paul visits home on leave, returns to the trenches, is wounded and sent to a military hospital. In the summer of 1918 German front is pushed back, and the soldiers are waiting for the end of the war. In October, when           there is nothing much to report on the western front, Paul is killed, a week or so before the armistice. - The story is narrated in first person in a cool style, a contrast to patriotic rhetoric. Remarque records the daily horrors in the trenches, where machine guns killed millions, in laconic understatement. - \"At the next war let all the Kaisers, Presidents and Generals and diplomats go into a big field and fight it out first among themselves. That will satisfy us and keep us home.\" (Katzinsky) Lewis Milestone's film (1930), based on the novel, is a landmark of American cinema. One of the best scenes is when Paul (Lew Ayres) returns to his school and tells new students the truth. \"When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all.\" The film was denounced by Goebbels as anti-German, but the Poles banned it for being pro-German. Particularly effective were the tracking shots of soldiers attacking enemy lines. In France it was prohibited until 1962. The close-up of Paul's hand reaching for the butterfly at the end, is actually the hand of the director Milestone. - A sequel, The Road Back , was made in 1937.           With All Quiet on the Western Front Remarque became a spokesman of \"a generation that was destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells,\" as he said himself. The German defeat inspired two major war films of the year 1930 - G.W. Pabst's Westfront 1918 , adapted from a novel by Ernest Johannsen and Lewis Milestone's film based on Remarque's novel. Milestone was unhappy with the original script - he saw it changed the point of the book, and he hired his friend Del Andrews and George Abbott, a stage director, the shape the final script. The producer Carl Laemmle Junior and Milestone both hated the original ending of the book, in which Paul Baumer dies heroically. Karl Freund, the cameraman, put forward the idea of the hand stretching out toward the butterfly.           In the 1930s Remarque's books were banned in Germany by the government. All Quiet on the Western Front and The Road Back were among the works consigned to be publicly burnt in 1933 by the Nazis. Stores were ordered to stop selling his books. The film's premiere was disrupted by Nazi gangs; Remarque was accused of pacifism. It was not until the 1950s the film was shown again in West Germany. In 1938 Remarque lost his citizenship. He had moved to Switzerland in 1932 and in 1939 he emigrated to the United States, where in 1947 he became a citizen. In New York he spent much time at the Stork Club and at 21. In Hollywood he made friends with stars, including the actress Paulette Goddard (1911-1990), whom he married in 1958. Remarque had been married twice before, and to the same woman, Jutta Ilse Ingeborg Ellen Zambona, in 1925 and again in 1938. After the war Remarque settled eventually back in Switzerland, where he made his residence at Porto Ronco on the Seiss shore of Lake Maggiore. His play, DIE LETZTE STATION, about the fall of the Third Reich, was produced in Berlin in 1956. Remarque died at the Sant Agnese clinic at Locarno, on September 25, 1970. He had suffered for months from aneurysm.           \"If things went according to the death notices, man would be absolutely perfect. There you find only first-class fathers, immaculate husbands, model children, unselfish, self-sacrificing mothers, grandparents mourned by all, businessmen in contrast with whom Francis of Assisi would seem an infinite egoist, generals dripping with kindness, humane prosecuting attorneys, almost holy munitions makers - in short, the earth seems to have been populated by a horde of wingless angels without one's having been aware of it.\" (from The Black Obelisk , 1956)           Remarque's later works, depicting the political upheavals of Europe from the 1920s to the cold war, did not achieve the critical acclaim of his first novel. However, his skill to create interesting characters, fascinating plots, and balancing between realistic and sentimental scenes made him a highly popular writer. DREI KAMERADEN (1937) received good reviews and was made into a film in 1938, directed by Frank Borzage. The screenplay was written by Edward A. Paramore and F. Scott Fitzgerald , who was determined to do a good job. Fitzgerald kept completely sober, for a while. However, his contract with M-G-M was not renewed. The final scene in which the two friends of the story are joined by their ghostly comrade, has still a strong emotional charge. Several of Remarque's later novels dealt with people struggling under Nazi rule. Arch of Triumph (1946) told a story about a German refugee physician and an actress. The work was adapted into screen in 1947, starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. Remarque himself played the schoolmaster Pohlmann in A Time to Love and a Time to Die (1958), based on his novel ZEIT ZU LEBEN UND ZEIT ZU STERBEN (1954). In the story a German soldier, Ernst Graeber, on furlough from the Russian front, falls in love with his childhood friend, Elisabeth. But he must return to the trenches. The German edition was censored for its \"unnational\" passages. Douglas Sirk's film version, beautifully photographed in CinemaScope, ends dramatically in Graeber's death.           Spark of Life (1952) was a fictional documentary about life in Nazi concentration camps. The Black Obelisk (1956) was a tragi-comedy, in which Remarque explored the chaotic Germany of in the 1920s. Remarque's screenplay The Last 10 Days for G.W. Pabst's film from 1956, was based Judge Michael A. Musmanno's book 10 Days to Die , a study of the death of Hitler in a Berlin bunker. DIE NACHT VON LISSABON (1962, The Night in Lisbon), in which two refugees from Nazism flee in Portugal, and SCHATTEN IN PARADIES, depicting refugees in the United Sates, were published posthumously in English in 1971.                      Primo Levi, 1919-1987                      Italian-Jewish writer and chemist, who first gained fame with his autobiographical story SE QUESTO &Egrave; UN UOMO (1947, If This is a Man) of survival in Nazi concentration camps. For the last forty years of his life Levi devoted himself to attempting to deal with the fact that he was not killed in Auschwitz. \"The worst survived, that is, the fittest; the best all died,\" he said. Levi also published poetry, science fiction, essays, and short stories. In 1987, at the age of 67, he killed himself. Italo Calvino called Levi \"one of the most important and gifted writers of our time.\"            Consider whether this is a man,            Who labours in the mud            Who knows no peace            Who fights for a crust of bread            Who dies at a yes or a no.            Consider whether this is a woman,            Without hair or name            With no more strength to remember            Eyes empty and womb cold            As a frog in winter.            (from 'Shem&aacute;' in Collected Poems )            Primo Levi was born in Turin into a Jewish middle-class family, the son of Cesare Levi, an engineer, and Ester \"Rina\" Luzzati; she had been his secretary. His grandmother Bimba was a baroness. She and her entire family had been made barons by Napoleon, because they had supported him economically. As a youth Levi knew very little about Jewishness, but Mussolini's anti-Semitic policy soon taught Levi that it was not ''a cheerful little anomaly'' in a Catholic country. An underdeveloped, quiet boy, Levi was derided at school for his size. Through cycling and mountain climbing he acquired friends, but according to a biography he did not have any sexual experience before meeting his wife, Lucia, in 1946. Just before the Fascist racial law of 1938 forbade Jews access to academic status, Levi started his chemistry studies at the University of Turin. He graduated first in his class in 1941, the year after Italy had entered World War II as an ally of Germany. During the war Levi wrote for the resistance magazine Giustizia e Libert&agrave; .            After the collapse of Mussolini's regime, he tried to contact a partisan group in the north of Italy. Levi was captured in December 1943. \"I was twenty-four,\" Levi wrote in If This Is a Man , \"with little wisdom, no experience and a decided tendency ... to live in an unrealistic world of my own, a world inhabited by civilized Cartesian phantoms, by sincere male and bloodless female friendships.\" He was first interned in a transit camp in F&ograve;ssoli, and then, two months later, deported to the camp of Moniwitz-Auschwitz. The number 174517 was tattooed on his left forearm.            From the railroad convoy of 650 people, fifteen men and nine women survived. Levi worked at one of three I.G. Farben laboratories and was spared the gas chambers. The company made synthetic rubber for the Nazi war machine. As a chemist he knew he could safely eat cotton wool and drink paraffin. A non-Jewish guest worker secretly gave him extra helpings of soup. To his friend Jean Samuel he taught Italian by quoting Dante; eating and translating Dante were both keys to survival. Dante remained a constant point of reference throughout Levi's writing. From the Ulysses episode of Inferno he chose a passage, which dealt with the crucial question \"What is a man?\" Levi's superior in the laboratory, Dr. Ferdinand Mayer, gave him a pair of leather shoes.            Liberated by the Soviets in January 1945, Levi returned to Turin in October. He took up his work as a chemist, living in a stately old building that his family had occupied for three generations. In 1961 Levi became the general manager of a factory producing paints. He retired in 1977 to become a full-time writer. With Hety Schmitt-Maas, whose husband had been a chemist for I.G. Farben, Levi corresponded almost 20 years. She also helped Levi to track down Dr. Meyer and sent him German books and newspaper clippings on Nazism.            His prison recollections Levi wrote in the form of a memoir, Se questo &egrave; un uomo , which documented how the camp deprived prisoners of their identity and finally annihilated them. When the major publisher Einaudi rejected the work, it was published by a small house. Ten years later it was reprinted in an enlarged edition. In Italy the book sold over half a million copies, was translated into eight languages and adapted for the theater and radio. Part of the book's impact was based on Levi's sober and precise style. In spite of the brutality to which he was subjected Levi described the terrible events objectively like an observing scientist, but also noted with compassion the heroism in the suffering.            Its sequel, LA TREGUA (1963), portrayed Levi's wanderings in war-torn eastern Europe in Poland, Belorussia, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania. During the journey Levi meets a gallery of colorful, rootless companions in misfortune, among them Mordo Nahum, a Greek, from whom Levi learns that in war you must first think of shoes, then the food. Without shoes you can't go after food. Levi returns home on the last pages of his account, but he has a continual nightmare in which his present life turns out to be a mere illusion and he wakes up with Auschwitz's morning call: \"Wstawac\". But Levi also uses his experiences as a basis for philosophical meditations, which connects the book to Jorge Sempr&uacute;n's L'&eacute;criture ou la vie (1994, Literature or Life), dealing with the return to life after the camp.            \"It is not at all an idle matter trying to define what a human being is.\"                        LA CHIAVE A STELLA (1978, The Monkey's Wrench) presented vivid stories told by Libertini Faussone, a construction worker and self-educated philosopher. The writer-chemist listens to him, and records his experiences in different parts of the world. \"All kids dream of going into the jungle or the desert of Malaya, and I also had those dreams, only I like to have my dreams come true; otherwise they're like some disease you carry around with you all your life, or like the scar of an operation that, whenever the weather turns damp, it starts aching again.\" Among Levi's other works is IL SISTEMA PERIODICO (The Periodic Table, 1975), which uses the Russian chemist Mendeleyev's periodical table of elements as the basis of autobiographical meditations. Its 21 pieces are each named after a chemical element. \"Every element brings a kind of 'click' for me,\" Levi wrote. \"It triggers a memory.\" 'Argon' is a homage to the author's Jewish ancestors. 'Vanadium' represents Levi's uncanny encounter with a former official in Auschwitz, Dr. M&uuml;ller, who was the chief of the laboratory, and 'Zinc', a boring metal, explorers the fascist myth of racial purity. SE NON ORA, QUANDO? (1989, If Not Now, When?) combined the emergence of Jewish consciousness and documentation of action taken on the Russian front by partisan Jewish groups against retreating Nazi forces. A group of Jewish partisans moves toward Palestine, blows up trains, and rescues victims of concentration camps.             \"Two years before the war began, the bell rope broke. It snapped near the top; the stairs were rotten; the bell ringer was an old man, and he was afraid to climb up there and put in a new rope. So after he announced the time by shooting a hunting rifle into the air; one shot, or two or three or four, That went on till the Germans came. They took his gun away from him, and the village was left without any time.\" (from If Not Now, When? )             Levi died in Turin on April 11, 1987. His death was apparently a suicide - Levi hurled himself down the central stairwell of his home building. Before and after Auschwitz Levi had suffered from depression, but his death was interpreted as a sign that he had not triumphed over his horrible experiences. In a lecture in 1979 Levi had expressed his deeply pessimistic view of humanity, seeing life as terrible. The last work he completed was the essay collection I SOMMERSI E I SALVATI (1986), where Levi returned to his belief in the historical uniqueness of the Holocaust. He asked how much of the camp is alive and well in our time, and how long it will remain in our memories. Levi points out that anti-Semitism was part of German culture, not merely a Nazi invention, and sees a paradoxical analogy between victim and oppressor. In the camp system also the oppressed unconsciously strove to identify with their oppressor. Useless violence dehumanises both guards and prisoners. \"Before dying the victim must be degraded, so that the murderer will be less burdened by guilt,\" he stated.                                   Elie Wiesel's statement, \"...to remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all...\"stands as a succinct summary of his views on life and serves as the driving force of his work. Wiesel is the author of 36 works dealing with Judaism, the Holocaust, and the moral responsibility of all people to fight hatred, racism and genocide.             Born September 30, 1928, Eliezer Wiesel led a life representative of many Jewish children. Growing up in a small village in Romania, his world revolved around family, religious study, community and God. Yet his family, community and his innocent faith were destroyed upon the deportation of his village in 1944. Arguably the most powerful and renowned passage in Holocaust literature, his first book, Night , records the inclusive experience of the Jews:             Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.             Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.             Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.            And Wiesel has since dedicated his life to ensuring that none of us forget what happened to the Jews.            Wiesel survived Auschwitz, Buna, Buchenwald and Gleiwitz. After the liberation of the camps in April 1945, Wiesel spent a few years in a French orphanage and in 1948 began to study in Paris at the Sorbonne. He became involved in journalistic work with the French newspaper L'arche . He was acquainted with Nobel laureate Francois Mauriac, who eventually influenced Wiesel to break his vowed silence and write of his experience in the concentration camps, thus beginning a lifetime of service. Wiesel has since published over thirty books, earned the Nobel Peace Prize, been appointed to chair the President's Commission on the Holocaust, awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement and more. Due to a fateful car accident in New York in 1956, Wiesel spent a year confined to a wheelchair while recovering. It was during this year that he made the decision to become a U.S. citizen and is still today an active figure within our society, as well as fulfilling his role in Jewish politics around the world.             Wiesel's job as chairman of the President's Commission on the Holocaust was the planning of an American memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The Report to the President on the President's Commission on the Holocaust focuses on memory. Wiesel writes that the reason for creating the museum must include; denying the Nazi's a posthumous victory, honoring the last wish of victims to tell, and protecting the future of humanity from such evil recurring. Always maintaining his dedicated belief that although all the victims of the Holocaust were not Jewish, all Jews were victims of the Holocaust, Wiesel advocated placing the major emphasis of the memorial on the annihilation of the Jews, while still remembering the murder of other groups.             Guided by the unique nature of the Holocaust and the moral obligation to remember, the Commission decided to divide and emphasize the museum into areas of memorial, museum, education, research, commemoration and action to prevent recurrence. In order to come to these decisions, a group of 57 members of the Commission and Advisory Board -- including Senators, Rabbis, Christians, professors, judges, Congressmen, Priests, Jews, men and women -- traveled to Eastern Europe, Denmark and Israel to study Holocaust memorials and cemeteries and to meet with other public officials. The emotional pain and commitment required by such a trip is remarkable, and Wiesel's leadership is undeniably noteworthy.                                                                                                                             Wiesel with Yitzhak Rabin                                                 Wiesel remained chairman of the Committee until 1986. He has aided in the recognition and remembrance of Soviet Jews, the establishment of Israel and has dedicated the latter part of his life to the witness of the second-generation and the vital requirement that memory and action be carried on after the survivors have all left us. Wiesel's own words are the best explanation:            Let us remember, let us remember the heroes of Warsaw, the martyrs of Treblinka, the children of Auschwitz. They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them.

They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them.                          The German Mujahid by Boualem Sansal is also part of this cluster as well as the Islamic one. It's common knowledge that, at the end of WWII, many German war criminals fled from justice via \"ratlines\" to South American countries. Less notorious, though, are the Nazis who, like the title character of Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal's excoriating new novel found permanent refuge in Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria and Algeria. Inspired by a visit to a European-style Algerian village whose mayor was a former SS officer, and by what he views as the Arab world's \"erasure\" of the Holocaust, Sansal has written a bracingly unsentimental, ingeniously structured story that not only lays bare past collusions between German fascists and Arab governments, but draws explicit parallels between Nazism and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, all the while grappling with the emotive question: \"are we responsible for the crimes of our fathers, of our brothers, of our children?\"             The German Mujahid is narrated by Malrich, a disaffected, thuggish teenager who lives on a deprived Arab housing project outside of Paris in the mid-1990s. After being expelled from school, he'd been passing the time all too typically for a kid of his background: \"I hung around the streets, took a couple of courses and a few part time jobs, did a bit of dealing, went to the mosque, wound up in court.\" But when Malrich is seventeen, his educated and professional 33-year-old brother Rachel commits suicide and leaves behind his diaries, which turn Malrich's world upside down. He discovers that their parents, who had sent the boys from Algeria to live in Paris as children, were massacred by Islamists in their village, A&iuml;n Deb, two years earlier during Algeria's \"dirty war,\" and that when Rachel returned home to visit their graves, he unearthed a secret even more horrifying than the manner of that brutal death. The contents of a suitcase in the family home&mdash;medals, military records, and souvenirs&mdash;revealed unequivocally that Rachel and Malrich's German father, Hans Schiller, was a highly-decorated SS officer personally responsible for the extermination of thousands of Jews at Auschwitz and Buchenwald.                                      Malrich's own diary with its pitch-perfect voice&mdash;streetsmart, bemused, loyal and lovable&mdash;is interspersed with excerpts from his brother's diary, whose entries are at first measured and reflective, but become increasingly traumatized and desperate as Rachel is eaten up by guilt, rage and an obsessive need to absorb every last detail of the agonies experienced by prisoners in the camps. Retracing the steps of his father's ghastly career, Rachel \"travels back through time,\" to Germany, Austria, Poland, Turkey, and Egypt. It is while at Auschwitz and Birkenau that he decides he will kill himself, \"for my father, for his victims, I will pay in full.\"              As Malrich attempts to somehow come to terms with what has happened to him and learn about the Holocaust&mdash;which, he admits, \"he didn't know anything about&hellip;I'd heard bits and pieces, things the imam said about the Jews and other stuff I'd picked up here and there\"&mdash;he resolves that \"where my father and Rachel had failed, I had to survive.\" But both brothers' lives are inescapably determined by their father's actions. Rachel literally turns himself into a concentration camp victim, growing more emaciated and haunted until, head shaved and wearing striped pyjamas, he gasses himself on the anniversary of his father's death, \"the day Hans Schiller finally eluded the justice of men.\" Malrich, on the other hand, directs his shame outward to save his beloved \"Sensitive Urban Area, Category 1\" housing project, which has slowly but surely been taken over by Islamists who are creating \"a concentration camp,\" with an atmosphere of \"all conquering Islam.\" Telling his friends that \"we're going to live, we're going to fight,\" Malrich considers it his legacy and his duty to first declare war on the \"Nazi jihadist fuckers,\" and then to \"tell the truth, all over the world.\"              Sansal's own compulsion to tell the truth all over the world is hampered, sadly, by the reality that although The German Mujahid has won plaudits in France including the RTL-Lire Prize, has been translated into German and Hebrew, and is being published in separate American and British editions, not only are there no plans to translate it into Arabic, but Sansal's work is banned in Algeria. The author, who refers to himself as \"secular in every bone in my body,\" had published several novels that sold well in his home country, having turned to writing after retiring from his job as Director of the Algerian Ministry for Industry. But with the publication in 2006 of Poste restante: Alger. Lettre de colere et d'espoir a mes compatriots &mdash;an open letter to his fellow citizens decrying the Nationalist-Islamist regime, which he says is teaching young Algerians an edited version of history&mdash;all of his books were removed from shelves.              Such censorship is particularly ironic given Sansal's mission as an artist. In writing The German Mujahid he wanted \"to ask what it might mean to take responsibility for ensuring that such crimes are never repeated,\" and the answer the novel gives is clear: it means heeding Primo Levi's insistence to \"Remember these words&hellip;Repeat them to your children.\" In its unflinching exploration of the horrors of history and its clear-eyed journey across the entire spectrum of humanity from good to evil, The German Mujahid mesmerizes from the very first sentence and commands you not to evade or recoil. Even the comfort of a hopeful conclusion is resisted; the closest thing to a consolation offered to the reader is the knowledge that Malrich will, as he promises, survive, and some day do what Rachel had wanted to: visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem: \"I'll read the names aloud, and, after every one, I'll ask their forgiveness in my father's name.\" Yet although reaching the end will leave you drained, devastated, and reeling, you'll still want to go back to the first page and start again. Sansal is a novelist at the absolute height of his powers and has, in raking over such ugliness, created a work of extraordinary beauty.                           Jonathan Littell              Jonathan Littell&rsquo;s The Kindly Ones begins, &ldquo;Oh my human brothers.&rdquo; In so doing, he loses no time in posing the question that the next thousand pages seek to answer: How can men treat their human brothers with calculating and unrelenting cruelty? The speaker is a former SS officer. His direct address is essential to this enterprise, and more than one note of chilling irony can be heard therein. One such is his uncommon cultivation. Littell, a dual citizen of France and the United States, wrote his novel in French, and many of its first readers recognized the famous opening line (&ldquo; Fr&egrave;res humains qui apr&egrave;s nous vivez &rdquo;) of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon&rsquo;s &ldquo; Ballade des pendus ,&rdquo; in which the poet, awaiting execution, begs for clemency. Unlike Villon, however, Littell&rsquo;s narrator, Maximillian Aue, seeks no pardon&mdash;and needs none. He has already eluded capture and, more than half a century after the war&rsquo;s end, leads an outwardly tranquil life manufacturing lace in northern France, married and with two children (who know nothing of his earlier life). He has decided to tell his long, grim tale. As he does, apostrophe will turn to accusation: &ldquo;Now of course the war is over. And we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson, it won&rsquo;t happen again. But are you quite sure we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson? Are you certain it won&rsquo;t happen again?&rdquo;                            Aue&rsquo;s story begins with the entry of the German Army into Ukraine in 1941 and ends with the fall of Berlin in 1945. The intervening stations are among the most horrific the war offered, from the massacre at Babi Yar to Stalingrad to Belzec and Auschwitz. Aue notes early on that what follows is &ldquo;a bleak story, but an edifying one too, a real morality play.&rdquo; For it to be edifying, however, Aue must be something other than what&rsquo;s expected. While he may witness and commit acts few would hesitate to call evil, his evil is far from banal and in no way corresponds to a stereotype. Aue is neither a blinkered lackey nor a bloodthirsty sadist. On the contrary, he is independent-minded, sensitive, and articulate. He does not believe Nazi propaganda concerning Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, or foreigners (he is himself bisexual and half-French). Nevertheless, he is at the tip of the spear&mdash;in the SS.               The result for the reader is a thought experiment of a special sort. We are inclined to declare that killers are not my human brothers. It&rsquo;s much more difficult to see that evil is made up of the same stuff as good. In The Gulag Archipelago , Solzhenitsyn remarked that &ldquo;the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either&mdash;but right through every human heart.&rdquo; Aue makes a similar case, stressing that not only psychopaths made the Holocaust possible. There were indeed such tortured and torturing souls, but they were a tiny minority, just as they were in Rwanda, Bosnia, Chechnya, and the other places Littell has spent time working for aid organizations. Some surely loved violence and craved blood; some suffered from madnesses we may be unable to understand. But there were also those&mdash;the vast majority&mdash;whose positions we can all too easily imagine. &ldquo;There are psychopaths everywhere, all the time,&rdquo; Aue says. &ldquo;Our quiet suburbs are crawling with pedophiles and maniacs, our homeless shelters are packed with raving megalomaniacs; and some of them do indeed become a problem, they kill two, three, ten, even fifty people&mdash;and then the very same State that would without batting an eye send them to war crushes them like a blood-swollen mosquito. These sick men are nothing. But the ordinary men that make up the State&mdash;especially in unstable times&mdash;now there&rsquo;s the real danger. The real danger for mankind is me, is you.\"                           An unknown American writer (even a bilingually educated one) who attempts to write an immense novel in French would usually expect to receive nothing but mockery for his trouble. As if the linguistic effort weren't audacious enough, then there's the subject matter: an epic of World War II gore and phantasmagoria from the point of view of a reflective--but largely unrepentant--German SS officer. It's the sort of literary high-wire act that should have ended in a face plant. Instead, Jonathan Littell's The Kindly Ones somehow swept France's top literary prizes when it was published in 2006. Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette histoire?                            After a brief prologue in which the narrator introduces himself as a war criminal in hiding, the action opens with the Germans' brutal invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and concludes, almost a thousand pages later, with Berlin in ashes in 1945. The protagonist and narrator, Dr. Max Aue, bobs along with the flow and ebb of German fortunes on the Eastern Front like a stormtrooper Candide--except that he inflicts as well as endures enormous suffering.                            Aue is not only an enthusiastic Nazi, but a first-class catastrophe of misdirected sexuality. Without giving anything away about his issues, let's just say that he gives anyone in Dr. Freud's files--or Greek tragedy--a run for their money. Yet whatever sympathy the narrator may occasionally earn for his tortured personal backstory, sporadic self-awareness and reliable literary flair is quickly squandered by his willing participation in many of the Nazi regime's atrocities, as well as several that are entirely his own.                            Aue's idiosyncratic psyche is a literary creation and not--as some critics have mistakenly assumed--some kind of psychosexual explanation of Nazism of the sort once popular but now largely discarded. Littell has no grand new theories of evil to offer, and to the extent he makes the rather commonplace observation that we are all capable of it, this is actually undercut by Aue's spectacular weirdness. Nor does Littell shed much light on the \"whys\" of the Holocaust, although the attentive reader will learn plenty about the \"how\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ever since Cervantes wrote Don Quixote, the novel has fluctuated between fact and fiction, sometimes digging so deeply into the whys of reality that fiction becomes truer than fact, or rather presents a side to reality that reveals deeper understanding. Raw reality, brutal honesty, and \"gruesome\" facts can often be too hard to take which is why relationships are coated in lies and social institutions from governments to marriages rely on censorship and suppression for the common good. As the novelist rips open the facade of lies, she reveals a frightening truth or a horror similar to what Conrad, Achebe, and Mario Vargas Llosa found in colonial Africa and South America. By definition novels are works of literary arts in which language, story-telling, structure, sequencing, and style create an aesthetic experience that contains or frames the \"truth\" they represent and often make the horror easier to stomach for both author and reader.      Heart of Darkness is based on his autobiography but like a recursive memoir, he plays with time, frames the narrative, and repeats certain salient conversations, incidents, and images to go deeper into the essential evil he found in every man, an evil that the African jungle exposed in its \"darkness.\" As a master prose stylist, he uses rich figurative language, rhythm, and tone color to give his horror an aesthetic form and the frame to distance the narration because the raw truth devastated him. What techniques do authors use to make the truth palatable?        As an orphan and exile, Conrad left his homeland to roam the seas during those scary years of rabid colonialism. For twenty years he led the practical life of a sailor, somehow managing to survive the worst misadventures. But his six months in the Congo under Leopold II were horrific. He was on a river boat that made its way to Stanley Falls, he got sick, and his job was to take out an even sicker agent like Kurtz who also died en route. He left disillusioned and disgusted with the entire African misadventure. And so he had to write about it.      Achebe lived in Nigeria and his Things Fall Apart is based on the real life of indigenous people and the history of the area. However, he structures this book as a Shakespearean tragedy with Okonkwo playing the \"king\" with the dramatic flaw--his machismo, pride, temper, stubbornness--that cause his misfortunes as much as the colonialists. This dramatic balance gives more weight to the novel where Africans are not just victims of greedy white colonialists but flawed persons in their own right who make fatal mistakes. He also sees the flaws of the culture and the inhumanity of their superstitions and beliefs especially regarding the killing of children. Yet Achebe took Conrad's writing literally and analyzed it as if it were of his time, 50 years later, which hardly seems fair. The irony is that Achebe benefited immensely from the British system of education, the British literary canon, and the English language. He became a scholar and professor, published his immensely successful Things Fall Apart in 1958 and spent most of his life in the U.S., in Ivy League schools like Bard on the Hudson for 15 years and his final days at Brown. He died in Boston March 21, 2013. Although he protested against Conrad's \"racism\" and fought against the Biafran war and other injustices, his life was that of a English language professor and novelist. In other words, he owed his career to his British education and opportunities and so there are many sides to colonialism. Most of his writing is in a realistic mode but he draws from African folk tales as well as the British canon.      The bottom line is that every culture has something good to offer and something bad to repudiate, i.e. there is no black and white in the literal sense.                    This book is long but brilliant! Quite simply, it's the sheer virtuosity of Littell's writing, which shines through in Charlotte Mandel's English translation, and does not falter even in rendering the most technically difficult and morally uncomfortable tableaus. His inventiveness jolts crackling energy into familiar history--an absolutely startling 87-page dive into the Battle of Stalingrad at the center of the novel being only one outstanding example. The awful grandeur of the subject, the breadth and depth of the author's historical research, the ease with which he shifts from naturalism to surrealism and allegory to farce, his perfect ear for dialogue in what is not only a foreign language but a completely alien way of thinking, the fearlessness with which he portrays the repellent--all of these are marks of a monumental achievement. If literary power is a function of ambition multiplied by ability, this book is simply off the charts.           Many readers will be overwhelmed by the violence of these blood-soaked pages, others by the often-numbing bureaucratic detail of how it was unleashed. Some will find unendurable the Nazi ideology spouted at length by Aue and other characters (though not endorsed, it goes without saying, by the author). Those left unoffended by the foregoing will still have to contend with Littell's exhaustive--and I mean exhaustive--fleshing out of Aue's tormented sexuality. But even this side of the story is told with uncommon skill, and convincingly embedded with the tale of Germany's rampage and destruction.                                    Most of classical Holocaust literature is written in a graceful, realistic, minimal style. What happens when the language were Gothic, over-the-top, satirical, funny, and exaggerated like Foer's book? What does language do to the tragedy of these events? How do authors like Littell and Sansal capture the voice of the other? What do you think of evil and good?                           Communist China                                          Gao Xingjian, born January 4, 1940 in Ganzhou (Jiangxi province) in eastern China, is today a French citizen. Writer of prose, translator, dramatist, director, critic and artist. Gao Xingjian grew up during the aftermath of the Japanese invasion, his father was a bank official and his mother an amateur actress who stimulated the young Gao's interest in the theatre and writing. He received his basic education in the schools of the People's Republic and took a degree in French in 1962 at the Department of Foreign Languages in Beijing. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) he was sent to a re-education camp and felt it necessary to burn a suitcase full of manuscripts. Not until 1979 could he publish his work and travel abroad, to France and Italy. During the period 1980-87 he published short stories, essays and dramas in literary magazines in China and also four books: Premier essai sur les techniques du roman moderne / A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction (1981) which gave rise to a violent polemic on \"modernism\", the narrative A Pigeon Called Red Beak (1985), Collected Plays (1985) and In Search of a Modern Form of Dramatic Representation (1987). Several of his experimental and pioneering plays - inspired in part by Brecht, Artaud and Beckett- were produced at the Theatre of Popular Art in Beijing: his theatrical debut with Signal d'alarme / Signal Alarm (1982) was a tempestuous success, and the absurd drama which established his reputation Arr&ecirc;t de bus / Bus Stop (1983) was condemned during the campaign against \"intellectual pollution\" (described by one eminent member of the party as the most pernicious piece of writing since the foundation of the People's Republic); L'Homme sauvage / Wild Man (1985) also gave rise to heated domestic polemic and international attention.      In 1986 L'autre rive / The Other Shore was banned and since then none of his plays have been performed in China. In order to avoid harassment he undertook a ten-month walking-tour of the forest and mountain regions of Sichuan Province, tracing the course of the Yangzi river from its source to the coast. In 1987 he left China and settled down a year later in Paris as a political refugee. After the massacre on the Square of Heavenly Peace in 1989 he left the Chinese Communist Party. After publication of La fuite / Fugitives , which takes place against the background of this massacre, he was declared persona non grata by the regime and his works were banned. In the summer of 1982, Gao Xingjian had already started working on his prodigious novel La Montagne de l'&Acirc;me / Soul Mountain , in which - by means of an odyssey in time and space through the Chinese countryside - he enacts an individual's search for roots, inner peace and liberty. This is supplemented by the more autobiographical Le Livre d'un homme seul / One Man's Bible .      A number of his works have been translated into various languages, and today several of his plays are being produced in various parts of the world. In Sweden he has been translated and introduced by G&ouml;ran Malmqvist, and two of his plays ( Summer Rain in Peking , Fugitives ) have been performed at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.      Gao Xingjian paints in ink and has had some thirty international exhibitions and provides the cover illustrations for his own books.

Vols. 27 &amp; 28, 1995-96.                        Soul Mountain is my favorite Chinese book because it depicts the ecological and history of China set in the oppressive world on Chinese communism where Buddhism and Confucianism form a spectral backdrop and the style is forged through an innovative postmodern use of the pronouns I, he, she, and you that deconstructs the psyche in a unique Chinese version of psychoanalysis that holds true to the sense of actual place and geography in the Eastern landscape.      While Gao&rsquo;s thinking may have some kinship with Lockean empiricism, he has taken his thinking and experience further into another area&mdash;his spatial deconstruction of self into nature, the past, and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy. The four pronouns experience nature differently even as the narrator travels through the mountains as a single human entity, a bit the way lone hikers &ldquo;dissolve&rdquo; after hours of hacking through the Appalachian trail. I think he won the Nobel Prize in part because he offered this new vision of self based on his experiences with the Cultural Revolution, his brush with death, his study of Euro-existentialism, and his ability to dissolve into nature as a hiker. Like much of Chinese culture, the deconstruction is spatial. Although there are dreams in this novel, his perception of self is deliberately fractured into he, you, I, and she.       the linear direction of a purposeful &ldquo;will.&rdquo; So his immurement is transcended by dissolving the conventional sense of self, wrapped up in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of conditioning, particularly Maoist thought, to experience the sensuality of all aspects of mind/body/spirit and the fusion of experience in the divine now where he plays with the Zen koan of God as a frog. How does this sense of self differ or enhance previous definitions in Euro-American and Arabic literature or even your perceptions of your self in the entrepreneurial workplace? He won the Nobel in part because of the creative spatial deconstruction of self and courageous journey into nature and the past when such trips were censored and politically blasphemous.             Born in China in 1954, Dai Sijie is an award-winning author and filmmaker. Caught up in China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution, he was \"re-educated\" between 1971 and 1974, and spent time working in a camp in a rural part of Sichuan province. After his re-education, he completed high school and university in China before departing for France in 1984 on a scholarship. He directed his first film in 1989. His first novel, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress was published in France in 2000. The translation became a national bestseller in America.             Sijie currently lives and works in Paris, France.       The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s was, of course, anything but. Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress describes the lives of the narrator and his close friend Luo during those years, as they are sent to a remote region for re-education by the peasants in 1971, when they are in their late teens. Neither is even a high school graduate yet, but as the sons of doctors they are suspicious -- obviously tainted by their bourgeois intellectual backgrounds -- and so, like millions of others of Chinese of the time, forced to participate in this disastrous social experiment.         They are sent to a truly remote corner of China: the alarm clock they bring along is the only timepiece in town, and it's a considerable journey even just to a place where movies are occasionally shown. Life is dreary and hard there, but the power of storytelling offers some respite: Luo and the narrator are sent to watch the films shown in the distant town and then re-tell them for the locals.         The power of storytelling becomes even more convincing when they come upon a stash of books that another acquaintance of theirs, being re-educated nearby, has managed to hoard. Books -- except, of course, the writings of Mao and perhaps Enver Hoxha -- are dangerous objects in this time (and nearly everyone they encounter is illiterate). The reactions of Luo and the narrator -- and then those they relate the stories they have read to -- perhaps explain why: Dai does an excellent job of conveying the rapture of losing oneself in the words and stories found in these books, so very different from the oppressive, dreary, and dangerous everyday lives of everyone here. They are all translated works: Balzac, Dumas, Romain Rolland, Tolstoy, Dickens, and more -- a treasure-trove of classical Western literature.         Four-Eyes, whose books they are, is unwilling to share his treasure, but after Luo and the narrator's appetite has been whetted by a sampling of Balzac they will do almost anything to get their hands on the suitcase containing these works. They are particularly eager also because not only are they invigorated by the marvels contained in the books, but they see what effect the words can have on others -- notably the little Chinese seamstress who lives fairly nearby.         The power of the books is great, the recounted stories intoxicating to those who the two share them with. And the books are of great value in this world, the only currency the two have to save the lives of one of the characters at one point. The books change several lives in the novel, showing that even in the darkest times imaginations (and ambitions) can not be entirely fettered.         Beside the books, Dai also offers a good small picture of China during the Cultural Revolution -- the small (and great) outrages, the petty humiliations, the people who managed to get by better than others within the system (notably Four-Eyes and his mother), the incredible poverty in the Chinese countryside. The book moves too quickly over much of this, offering a few episodes to focus on and skipping over long periods of (admittedly probably very dreary) time. Still, it offers a good glimpse of China during the Cultural Revolution, and of the power of literature (and the deep loathing for a system and people who keep literature out of the hands of readers).                   Anchee Min&rsquo;s (b 1956) writing has been praised for its raw, sharp language and historical accuracy. Her bestselling memoir, RED AZALEA, the story of her childhood in communist China, has been compared to THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK. Min credits the English language with giving her a means to express herself, arming her with the voice and vocabulary to write about growing up during China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution. &ldquo;There was no way for me to describe those experiences or talk about thoLike every child of her generation, Min was taught to write &ldquo;Long Live Chairman Mao!&rdquo; before she was taught to write her own name. She believed in Mao and Communism. At the age of 17, Min was sent to a labor camp near East China Sea, where she discovered the truth of Mao&rsquo;s calling. She endured mental and physical hardships, which included a severe spinal cord injury. She worked for three years before talent scouts spotted her toiling in a cotton field. Madame Mao, preparing to take over China, was looking for a leading actress for a propaganda film. Min was selected for having the ideal &ldquo;proletarian&rdquo; look. Mao died before the film was complete, and Madame Mao, blamed for the disaster of the revolution, was sentenced to death. Min was labeled a political outcast by association. She was disgraced, punished, and forced to perform menial tasks in order to reform herself. In 1984, with the help of a friend overseas, Min left China for America. She spoke no English when she arrived in Chicago, but within six months had taught herself the language in part by watching &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Roger&rsquo;s Neighborhood&rdquo; on American television.              Since the completion of RED AZALEA, Min has written six subsequent works of historical fiction: KATHERINE, BECOMING MADAME MAO, WILD GINGER, EMPRESS ORCHID, THE LAST EMPRESS, PEARL OF CHINA. The books attempt to re-record histories that have been falsely written. &ldquo;If my own history is recorded falsely, how about other people?&rdquo; she asks. Both critics and writers have praised her work, calling it &ldquo;historical fiction of the first order.&rdquo; Her most recent book, PEARL OF CHINA (April 2010/Bloomsbury), is a fictional account of the 40 years that writer Pearl S. Buck spent in China..              September 29, 2000             TBR: With so much having been written already about Madame Mao, what made you choose her as your subject for your novel, BECOMING MADAM MAO?             AM: It was the process, the process of how she, a beautiful woman who once possessed tremendous innocence, turned into a monster. I hadn't seen that done before.             TBR: What was your research process like? How much of what you knew of her as a historical figure was correct and what new things did you learn about her that you found fascinating?             AM: The research process was long and hard. It took me five years just to get my notes straight. Most of the crime she was accused of was correct. What's fascinating to learn was that Mao was behind her in her major moves, i.e. the Cultural Revolution. I had the idea most people had at the beginning: that she was simply a power-craver, a White-bone-demon as she is universally known. I was surprised to discover a lot of human side to her. The Jiang Ching Madame Mao as a lover, a wife, and a mother.             TBR: Ultimately, what will her legacy be, as an icon and as a woman?             AM: To the people of China she would most likely remain her official title as the White-bone-demon for quite a time. To me she would be an icon of a very sad time and a woman who lost her soul to demons as she rebelled against the society, which treats women as grass to be walked on.             TBR: Is the title also a reference to your BECOMING MADAME MAO since you wrote the book in the first person and thus created a voice for Madame Mao --- did you channel her through your own sensibilities?             AM: Not really, although I did channel her through my own sensibilities. It was not natural for me to think of her in that way. It was a difficult writing process. On the one hand I had to do her justice, which meant that I shouldn't be judgmental; on the other, I had a hard time comprehending her in many cases. For example, I couldn't bring myself to justify the lives she had taken during the Cultural Revolution in order to revenge and protect her career. She was heartless and purely evil. I hated her.             TBR: How did your writing change after the enormous success of your memoir RED AZALEA?             AM: The main change was the self-confidence. I started to believe that I could write. So I pushed myself to be more original, creative, and to develop the courage to deal with failure when it happens.             TBR: What was the most difficult thing about writing RED AZALEA?              AM: To live the time over again. It was painful.               TBR: How was writing KATHERINE, your first novel, different from your experience writing BECOMING MADAME MAO?               AM: The scale was much larger both in background and characters. There were four major characters in KATHERINE while more than twenty in BECOMING MADAME MAO. Also, I had to follow the record of history tightly in BECOMING MADAME MAO. It was a totally different experience.               TBR: When did you decide to be a writer? As a former actress, what skills did you learn in that art form that affected your writing life?               AM: I didn't decide. The reason I wrote was to learn English so I could graduate from college and get a job to be a small firm secretary. I never dared to dream. I was a new immigrant and survival was the only thing on my mind at the time. Talking about being a former actress, I was never one to begin with. Madame Mao's people picked me from a cotton field for the way I looked --- a proletarian peasant, not that I had any acting skills. I love writing because I don't have to show my face. I had a chance to be exposed to a lot of classic monologues while studying acting. Maybe that affected my writing.               TBR: How do you see the Internet affecting the future of fiction? Do you read ebooks or books online?               AM: The Internet is affecting everything on the face of the earth. Future fiction has to be created unique enough in a non-replaceable form to survive and thrive. I haven't had the chance to explore ebooks or books online yet.               TBR: Would you ever consider writing a story or book that would only be available online?               AM: I need to give the idea some thought before I know what I am talking about on this issue.               TBR: Do you believe that the sharing of history like this can help to change the contemporary world? By learning from the past?               AM: Definitely.               TBR: What books and authors have influenced you the most throughout your life?               AM: I have to give you a list of Chinese names. Most of these authors are unknown to the western public, i.e. Tang Xian-zu of 1200. I read him when I was 14 in a dark storage where Red Guards placed their rooted goods.               TBR: What are you reading now?               AM: Historical documents. I am doing it for my next project. In fact, I just got back from China last week. I spent my summer digging out books in the basement of the Museum of History in Shanghai. Every time I got in, I felt like a cockroach being sprayed --- the book-storage is heavily sprayed with chemicals in order to prevent the bugs from eating the pages away. It is a place filled with treasure --- lots of out of print and lost books. Material that is crucial to my subject. I am reading everything that interests me around the late Qing Dynasty 1800-1911.               TBR: In one sentence, what is one piece of invaluable advice you have picked up over the years of writing?               AM: I ask myself, \"Will you still write if this piece doesn't get published?\" If the answer is yes, then I know that I meant to write it.

Second draft of webfolios due. Be prepared  to read aloud. Group discussions on &quot;How to find and develop good  stories&quot; and &quot;The American Dream.&quot;   New York-- The Twenties versus  the Nineties. Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Even though  they symbolize the American Dream, what are the prisons embedded in The Great  Gatsby, Jazz and Cosmopolis? Is your American Dream just to be--  happy? Remember this when we get to Brave New World. In the twenties, the  American Dream was Forbidden Fruit for many Americans. Langston Hughes captures  this dilemma brilliantly in his poem, Harlem--   What happens to a dream  deferred?   Does it dry up   Like a raisin in the sun?   Or does it fester like a sore -   And then run?   Does it stink like rotten meat?   Or crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet?   Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.   Or does it explode?   The following is my favorite descriptive  passage from The Great Gatsby because I love the way he personifies the lawn  and uses kinesthetic imagery to capture the brazen energy and grandiosity of  the nouveau riche and the role the women, particular Daisy, play in this  splendid charade-- &quot;Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a  cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn  started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile,  jumping over sun-dials and brick walls and burning gardens--finally when it  reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the  momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing  now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom  Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.   He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw-haired man  of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining,  arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the  appearance of always leaning aggessively forward. Not even the effeminate swank  of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed to  fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see  a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It  was a body capable of enormous leverage--a cruel body....   We walked through a huge hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely  bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and  gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way  into the house. A breeze blew thorugh the room, blew curtains in at one end and  out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake  of the ceiling-- and then ripple over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on  it as wind does on the sea.   The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on  which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an achored balloon. They  were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they  had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have  stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the  groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the  rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and  the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.&quot;  (11-12) Note the synesthesia--&quot;groan of a picture,&quot; the use of dashes  to make the description dynamic, and the way these short passages show how  completely Tom dominates the scene, physically, sexually, materially--but maybe  not spiritually.   Note how DeLillo deconstructs his  journey through Manhattan. Is the author seeping in through Benito? Is this a  naturalistic journey? DeLillo does not orchestrate his characters, although he  is a fierce and fabulous social critic. Every word must succumb to his personal  style--   DeLillo simply and vividly describes  his raison d'etre-- &quot;I am a sentence maker. Like a donut maker, only  slower,&quot; or &quot;Every sentence has a truth waiting at the end of it and  the writer learns how to know it when he finally gets there. On one level this  truth is the swing of the sentence, the beat and poise, but down deeper it's  the integrity of the writer as he matches with the language. I've always seen  myself in sentences. I begin to recognize myself, word by word, as I work  through a sentence. The language of my books has shaped me as a man. There's a  moral force in a sentence when it comes out right. It speaks the writer's will  to live....The words typed on the page have a sculptural quality. They form odd  correspondences. They match up not just through meaning but through sound and  look. The rhythm of a sentence will accomodate a certain number of syllables.  One syllable too many, I look for another word. There's always another word  that means the same thing, and if it doesn't then I'll consider altering the  meaing of a sentence to keep the rhythm, the syllable beat. I'm completely  willing to let language press meaning upon me. Watching the way in which words  match up, keeping the balance in a sentence--these are sensuous pleasures. I  type rather than write longhand because I like the way words and letters look  when they come off the hammers onto the page--finished, printed and beautifully  formed.&quot;   Futuristic America-- Brave New  World by Aldous Huxley. How do Huxley's predictions still apply to the world of  clones and bioengineering? Have our values changed since the 1930s? Is  happiness incompatible with art, science, monogamous love and family ties? What  would happen if there were no death? If old age, suffering, weakness and  disease were abolished, would that also mean the end of religion? If everyone  were happy on earth, would we need God? What is your ideal designer baby? If  you could stop aging at 50 and stay the same for the next fifty years, would  you do it? What would happen if everyone did? What do you think of nursing  homes and early retirement? Should people just 'hang out' for thirty years,  living off the state?     At one point in most writers' careers, they tackle the unknown, ineffable and potentially blasphemous task of imagining god and personifying prophets. Like Nikos Kazantzakis, they can be a believing Christian who creates a more sensuous, tormented version of Christ tortured by temptation as he struggles with the demands of divinity. Or they can be like Aldous Huxley as he creates an alternative religion based on a distortion of science, bioengineering, and technology where people worship Our Ford instead of Our Lord. Where is god in books like The Bluest Eye, Lolita, The Sand Child, or The Patience Stone? In Saadawi's books, God often dies (or at least the personification of him or his embodiment in corrupt leaders), or resigns as in her censored play. But in God Resigns at the Summit Meeting , Eve, Bint Allah, and Isis offer humanity alternatives as female deities. Naguib Mahfouz and Salman Rushdie almost lost their lives for personifying Mohammad in Children of Gebelaawi (of the Alley) and Satanic Verses because they made him flawed--a womanizer and a hashish smoker. Where is god in books like The German Mujahid, The Kindly Ones, Night, and If This is a Man? God lets these stories be told but he also didn't stop the holocaust. In Gao Xi Jiang's Soul Mountain , God is a frog with one eye open and one blinking. Savoring the moment of falling snow is as close as we get to paradise.      For a scientific perspective on imagining god, I recommend Alan Lightman's new book Mr. G. Like Einstein's Dreams, this short novel is based on a lifetime of study as a prominent theoretical physicist and in its pithy prose poetry invites us to imagine the creation of our world, our galaxy, and an infinite number of galaxies. I met Lightman at an MIT conference in 2006 where I was invited to give a paper on the personification of particle physics in my narrators in my trilogy of novels published in 2006, now censored by the Dean. MIT was one of the few places that actually understood what I did in my novels, (London, Paris, and Tel Aviv were the others) in part because of the work Lightman has done for years as Humanities and Physics Professor and author of extraordinary compressed, brilliant prose poetry. I personally prefer longer, linguistically complex works, but Lightman is one of the few minimalist writers I adore probably because his intellect is so maximal. Even if you have no time at all because you are so busy with work and school, spend five minutes every night reading a chapter of this book and reflecting on it as you go to sleep. You will get a deeper understanding of science and religion as well as ideas to stimulate your own imagination and sense of wonder. Unlike Joyce and Rushdie, Lightman's writing is simple and clear, but it reflects the same depth of research, understanding, and knowledge, albeit in a different area. Lightman is one of the great writers of our century.

Course objectives are to expand our knowledge   and appreciation of the style and structure of literary works, and to examine   their didactic, aesthetic and entertainment values in terms of the cultural   relativity of world literature.     Classes are a combination of Meatspace   as we bring selected reading to life through oral interpretation and performance;    Deepspace as   we do in-class writing on close textual analysis, subjective interactions and   the relation of our unconscious, dreams, emotions etc. to the reading; and  Cyberspace ,   investigating themes and multidisciplinary issues related to our weekly expository   papers and the final research project. In addition we will design literary web   sites on our chosen topics.

Writing and reading...require being alert and ready for unaccountable beauty,   for the intricateness or simple elegance of the writer's imagination, for the   world that imagination evokes. Both require being mindful of the places where   imagination sabotages itself, locks its own gates, pollutes its vision. Writing   and reading mean being aware of the writer's notions of risk and safety, the   serene achievement of, or sweaty fight for, meaning and response-ability.   Whatever may be their use in civilised societies, mirrors are   essential to all violent and heroic action.   Poets are men who refuse to utilize language.   Some say it is best not to go near the center of time. Life   is a vessel of sadness, but it is noble to live life, and without time there   is no life. Others disagree. They would rather have an eternity of contentment,   even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly mounted in a case.   \"Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates success.\"   That is a man's sentence;...it was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman's   use....Moreover a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences   built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been   made by men out of their own needs for their own uses. There is no reason to   think that the form of the epic or the poetic play suits a woman any more than   the sentence suits her. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands--   another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels.   The \"engaged\" writer knows that words are actions.   Writers are among the most sensitive, the most intellectually   anarchic, most representative, most probing of artists. The ability of writers   to imagine what is not the self, to familiarize the strange and mystify the   familiar, is the test of their power. The languages they use and the social   and historical context in which these languages signify are indirect and direct   revelations of that power and its limitations.   Why write? Each one has his reasons: for one, art is a flight;   for another, a means of conquering.   One of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the   need of feeling that we are essential in relation to the world.   All our literature and art are for the masses of the people,   and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created   for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.   ...a great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes   place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all its faculties.   Like a domestic animal, time doesn't move without human beings'   strict supervision.   When the words form under his pen, the author doubtless sees   them, but he does not see them as the reader does, since he knows them before   writing them down. The function of his gaze is not to reveal, by stroking them,   the sleeping words which are waiting to be read, but to control the sketching   of the signs.   What does death matter? Communism is the truth. Because they   appear almost always in conjunction with representations of black or Africanist   people who are dead, impotent, or under complete control, these images of blinding   whiteness seem to function as both antidote for and meditation on the shadow   that is companion to this whiteness-- a dark and abiding presence that moves   the hearts and texts of American literature with fear and longing.   Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images.   Race has become metaphorical-- a way of referring to and disguising   forces, events, classes, and expressions of social decay and economic division   far more threatening to the body politic than biological \"race\" ever was.   It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be   woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress   on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak   consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech for anything written   with that conscious bias is doomed to death. It ceases to be fertilised. ...Some   collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before   the act of creation can be accomplished.   Reading seems, in fact, to be the synthesis of perception and   creation.   In this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time   and there is body time. The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum   of iron that swings back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The second   squirms and wriggles like a bluefish at bay. The first is unyielding, predetermined.   The second makes up its mind as it goes along.... Where the two times meet,   desperation. Where the two times go their separate ways, contentment. ... Each   time is true but the truths are not the same.   There is no romance free of what Herman Melville called \"the   power of blackness,\" especially not in a country in which there was a resident   population, already black, upon which the imagination could play; through which   historical, moral, metaphysical, and social fears, problems, and dichotomies   could be articulated. The slave population, it could be and was assumed, offered   itself up as surrogate selves for meditation on problems of human freedom, its   lure and its elusiveness. This black population was available for meditations   on terror-- the terror of European outcasts, their dread of failure, powerlessness,   Nature without limits, natal loneliness, internal aggression, evil, sin, greed.   In order to know himself, each person carries his own Book   of Life, which is filled with the history of his life. ...With time, each person's   Book of Life thickens until it cannot be read in its entirety....Some have stopped   reading altogether. ... Such people walk with the limber stride of their youth.   Such people have learned how to live in a world without memory.   I fear for you young people because you do not understand how   strong is the bond of kinship. You do not know what it is to speak with one   voice. And what is the result? An abominable religion has settled among you.   A man can now leave his father and his brotheres. He can curse the gods of his   fatheres and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes mad and turns   on his master.

Course Description   Major Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Writers is an introduction to the work of significant global writers from early Modernism to the twenty-first century in the Anglo-American, European, South American, Islamic, and Asian clusters. Most of these writers have won the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, Dublin IMPAC, the Prix Goncourt, or others, and almost all have been censored by someone at some time. These books also represent a wide range of styles including naturalist, realist, fantasy, science-fiction, modernist, minimalist, post-modern, terrorist, and eco-literary, covering a fascinating time period through two World Wars, utopias and dystopias, terrorism, media proliferation, and incredible innovation and destruction because of science, technology and the ravages of nature. Studying global literature allows us to dig deeper beneath the surface of global affairs and to plunge into the heart and soul of courageous, creative writers who dared defy the norm and transgress societal taboos in their pursuit of art and truth. This semester we will explore how great authors treat the themes of love, sex, power, and perversion across cultures with humor and compassion for an in-depth study of characterization and an overview of twentieth century cultural history.

Introductory Lesson and Overview of Course Content by Professor Julia Keefer  The Twentieth Century was a century of tumultuous opposites: self versus state, psychoanalysis versus fascism, positive rationalism versus surrealism and Dadaism, technological advancement versus return-to-nature, science versus art, and love against death.  Lovers and other Monsters explores the underbelly of Power, Politics, and Progress that characterizes the twentieth century through a cross-cultural selection of novels and plays written by winners of the Nobel Prize, the IMPAC, the Pulitzer, and the Goncourt.  FRENCH: No Exit by Jean-Paul Sartre 1944  Three damned souls, Garcin, an army deserter, Ines, a cruel lesbian, and Estelle, a baby-killer meet in hell depicted as a Second Empire Drawing Room where sleep, dreams, and change of any kind are denied and these three misfits must torment each other for eternity. This one-act play, written at the end of the occupation in Paris in World War II, is also a dramatic manifesto of Sartre\u2019s existentialist philosophy with maxims like \u201cMan is the sum of his actions, Hell is other people, etc.\u201d  RUSSIAN: Lolita by Nabokov 1955  This exquisitely written novel is in the voice of Humbert Humbert, the pedophile protagonist whose erudite language and meticulous descriptions mask the perversity of his intentions, actions, and thoughts although the precious Lolita also uses the older men for her own designs.  AFRICAN-AMERICAN: The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison 1970  This was Morrison\u2019s first novel, a raw, beautiful, and bitter book about racism, lookism, and sexual abuse written in her distinctive style which won her the Nobel Prize.  EGYPTIAN: The Death of the Only Man on Earth Beirut 1974 was Nawal el Saadawi\u2019s original God Dies by the Nile and blends a picturesque journey of the Egyptian sun through its diurnal light and darkness as a witness to atrocious deeds committed by the powerful men in the small village of Kafr el Teen.  FRENCH: The Lover by Marguerite Duras 1984  As a seventy year old woman, Duras looked back on an affair she had with a Chinese millionaire when she lived as a teenage girl  COLOMBIAN: Love in the Time of Cholera by GG Marquez 1985  This story takes place between 1880 and 1930 in the Caribbean. Florentino and Fermina fall in love in their youth but fate and finances separate them until old age when they are finally reunited on a cholera ship. Marquez compares the trajectory of romantic love to a disease like cholera and yet at the end of his life, he said there was nothing more important than love.  GERMAN: Perfume by Patrick Suskind 1985  This is an historical thriller that takes place in eighteenth century Paris about an orphan Grenouille who lacked a smell himself but became a parfumer  GLOBAL: Lovers and other Monsters, ed. By M. Kaye 1992 (Doubleday Asimov, Poe, Wharton, Wells, Doyle et al)  AMERICAN: Black Water by Joyce Carol Oates 1992  Kelly Kelleher\u2019s liturgical death is told in a recursive, repetitive third person style with modernist and postmodern techniques as the gas and water from the swamp seep into the inside of the car that her \u201cdate\u201d The Senator crashed because of his excessive drinking at the party, a story that satirizes Chappaquiddick where Senator Kennedy may have done the same thing with Mary Jo who also died in the carr.  CHINESE: Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress by Dai Sijie 2000  Beijing censorship meets the need of young boys to explore the world through books as they also fall in love with a little seamstress and want to share with her all their forbidden fruits.  PERUVIAN: Feast of the Goat by Mario Vargas Llosa 2000  A three-pronged tandem competitive narrative situates the assassination of Trujillo against a framed story where Urania, a New York lawyer, returns to the Dominican Republic to see her aged, demented father who compromised her virginity years ago in order to please Trujillo. Here is a real monster!  AFGHANISTAN: The Patience Stone by Atiq Rahimi 2008  An unnamed archetypal Afghan woman nurses her comatose wounded warrior husband as shooting and various commotions from the war outside occasionally interrupt her long monologue where she reveals the secrets of her life to her \u201cpatience stone\u201d until he explodes.  TURKISH: Museum of Innocence by Orhan Pamuk 2009  Pamuk looks back on young, wealthy Turkish people in the seventies, describing how they lived, and how the protagonist collected all the mundane clothes, jewels, and even cigarette butts of his love Fusun in order to put them in a museum which now exists in Istanbul.                 Introduction to Close Textual Analysis                      Write out a passage from the book, approximately one page, triple-spaced, numbering every line. The triple spaces are for you to analyze meter, long and short stresses, or note figures of speech, and to really focus on the exact words the author has written.\u00a0You do not write your essay in between these spaces. Your analysis comes after the passage in standard MLA format with good sentence structure and paragraph progression. In the age of the Internet, it is easy to get literary analyses and critical theory, so it is important for you to focus on your intimate relationship with the text and what it means to you. As such, I will not be giving examples of the ideal textual analysis. In fact, there is no ideal analysis, because every text is different and you are all different from each other. It's not objective like arithmetic. This lesson will give you guidelines to help you with the vocabulary and structure of analysis, but you must make it your own, edit it,\u00a0and improve upon it throughout the semester. At this introductory level, pass/fail grades are given because analyses can always get better. I know a PhD candidate who has been analyzing Yeats for the past forty years. Be patient with yourselves, read closely, and focus carefully, but use your imaginations to interpret the text your way.       \u00a0    Analyze the passage for intrinsic and extrinsic meaning, relationship to the rest of the text, rhetorical devices, structure, and aesthetics. Even though you are concentrating on a single passage, it is important that you read the entire work to understand its relationship to the whole. First of all you must understand the denotative and connotative meanings of every word in the text. Use your thesaurus and dictionary frequently so that you understand every possible meaning, even when you think you know what is being said. Then analyze sentence structure (simple, complex, compound, compound-complex) and paragraph structure and progression in a novel or short story, dialogue and action in a play, prosody if a poem. Most of your works are novels but you should also know how to analyze poetry.       When you analyze language, place close attention to both diction, or choice of words, (formal, informal, colloquial, concrete, abstract) and rhetorical devices. Even prose passages can be scanned to determine rhythm. It is not enough to identify these devices-- you must relate them to the whole, and evaluate their impact on story, dramatic structure, narrative voice and sequencing, aesthetics, meaning, and character objectives.    \u00a0    This first close reading focuses on the HOW of the text, how the writers created the beauty and meaning from the words they chose arranged as they saw fit. By understanding prosody, style, and structure you can get better breakdown the passage into its components. Then you can ask the WHY questions that connect this form to content. Language is a symbolic and metaphoric art. To be successful, the readers must translate these black lines on the white page into images, feelings, and thoughts in their minds that bring the world to life. It may not be the exact world the writer intended, which is part of the reader-response criticism discussed in the literary theory Lesson.       Does the passage describe a natural or artificial scene and what is the degree of plausibility, suspension of disbelief? How vivid and explicit is the descriptive language? To which senses does it appeal most? Does it describe character as monologue or dialogue, explicit or unconscious? Does it describe an action, develop an argument or an idea connected with the larger world of the fiction? How is the passage sequenced, in other words, what comes before and after, and why? How does this relate to the overall dramatic structure? Is this a passage devoted to exposition, complication, turning point, crisis, climax or resolution? What are the levels of empathy or emotional involvement? Comedic techniques or devices to increase suspense and drama? In what person is the novel told? In a drama, how successfully are the characters orchestrated? How is language used aesthetically to develop theme and how his theme related to the central dramatic question and the protagonist's objectives? In this global literature course, how do style and structure reflect the taste of the indigenous culture? How does this passage compare with another one on the same content, but from a different culture? For whom is the story written? How does the narrative voice relate to audience?          After thinking about all of the above, let us go into detail on the various sections. Part I Lesson I focuses on Form, while Part II focuses on content. You must always relate the two.          FORM       Meter in poetry or grammar, sentence length, paragraph progression in prose       Rhythm in stressed and unstressed syllables       Rhyme where applicable       Tone Color including alliteration, assonance, consonance and onomatopoeia      Figures of Speech including metaphors, similes, personification, analogy                    The Music of Words                                  Read aloud your triple-spaced passage and note the sentence length, paragraph progression or prosody in poetry. How long or short are the lines, sentences, and paragraphs? What effect does this have? Always relate form to the overall meaning. In translated works, you can still analyze the length of lines, sentences and paragraphs but not the exact meter, rhythm or tone color. These are reserved for works written in English.          Meter is analyzed in terms of metric feet--iamb,u_ trochee,_u anapest, uu_dactyllic, _uu, spondee, __pyrrhic,uu. Most British poetry is written in iambic pentameter. A spondee has a finality about it while a pyrrhic is light, an anapest is a waltz rhythm, and a trochee makes you stop and think backwards.          Rhymes can come at the end of the line and a rhyme scheme can look like this A B A B C D E C D E FF, refering to the end of the line, but rhymes can also be internal. In Part III of my trilogy I have the Electoweak Force narrator talk in rhymes because it mimics the electrons. What do rhymes do to the meaning of the piece?          Words are letters taking up space on a page that when read aloud form a pattern in time. What is the overall affect of this pattern related to the meaning of the book?                           Tone Color                                          Tone color relates to the sound of the words, like movement quality amplifies dance, resonance music, and color painting. Alliteration is the repetition of the first sound like &quot;Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.&quot; Consonance is the repetition of consonants like &quot;Sister Suzie sells seashells down by the seashore.&quot; Assonance is the repetition of vowels like &quot;How now, brown cow.&quot; Onomatopoeia occurs when the tone color mimics the sound of the thing described, such as &quot;babbling brook.&quot; There are many categories of tone color, but see how the style determines how you feel about the characters and their thoughts and actions and how you experience the setting.      Again tone color is best evaluated in original, not translated works.                                    Figures of Speech                                          Figures of Speech refer to words that are used to connote other things or feelings than what is being literally described. A simile uses like or as if, such as, &quot;her eyes are like seashells,&quot; while a metaphor says something is something it is not, such as &quot;her eyes are seashells.&quot; Personification is the attribution of human characteristics to non-human entities such as the narrators in My Name is Red or Part II of my trilogy. Obviously, trees, dogs, cats, the Statue of Liberty, the Sphinx etc cannot speak English but we personify them to give depth and breadth to a story.      \u00a0      Even in translation you can evaluate figures of speech. What do they do to the experience of the passage? Some Native American writers prefer literal words and meanings because the sky and the sand are good enough, while writers like Virginia Woolf make put diamonds on waves, and describe nature in terms of human beauty. What do the figures of speech reveal about the narrators, characters and their worlds?              Rhetorical Devices       Using selections from All Quiet on the Western Front as examples, please review the following to help you with close textual analysis:     Humor, with metaphor: &quot;My arms have grown wings and I'm almost afraid of going up into the sky, as though I held a couple of captive balloons in my fists.&quot;     Personification: &quot;The wind plays with our hair; it plays with our words and thoughts.&quot;  &quot;Over us Chance hovers.&quot;     Euphemism: &quot;At the same time he ventilates his backside.&quot; &quot;All at once he remembers his school days and finishes hastily:'he wants to leave the room sister.'&quot;     Imagery: &quot;To no man does the earth mean so much as to the soldier. When he presses himself down upon her long and powerfully, when he buries his face and his limbs deep in her from the fear of death by shell-fire, then she is his only friend, his brother, his mother; he stifles his terror and his cries in her silence and her security; she shelters him and releases him for ten seconds to live, to run, ten seconds of life; receives him again and often forever.&quot; (and personification) &quot;The front is a cage in which we must await fearfully whatever may happen.&quot;     Repetition: &quot;Earth!-Earth!-Earth!&quot;     Antithesis: &quot;A man dreams of a miracle and wakes up to loaves of bread.&quot;     Parallel Construction: &quot;My feet begin to move forward in my boots, I go quicker, I run.&quot;     Simile: &quot;He had collapsed like a rotten tree.&quot;     Metaphor: &quot;Immediately a second [searchlight] is behind him, a black insect is caught between them and tries to escape--the airman.]     Liturgical prose: &quot;Our being, almost utterly carried away by the fury of the storm, streams back through our hands from thee, and we, thy redeemed ones, bury ourselves in thee, and through the long minutes in a mute agony of hope bite into thee with our lips!&quot;     Apostrophe: &quot;Ah! Mother, Mother! You still think I am a child--why can I not put my head in your lap and weep?&quot;     Allusion: &quot;The guns and the wagons float past the dim background of the moonlit landscape, the riders in the steel helmets resemble knights of a forgotten time; it is strangely beautiful and arresting.&quot;     Hyperbole: &quot;They are more to me than life, these voices, they are more than motherliness and more than fear; they are the strongest, most comforting things there are anywhere: they are the voices of my comrades.&quot;     Rhetorical question: &quot;If one wants to appraise it, it is at once heroic and banal--but who wants to do that?&quot;     Aphorism: &quot;...terror can be endured so long as a man simply ducks--but it kills, if a man thinks about it.&quot;     Symbolism: &quot;I pass over the bridge, I look right and left; the water is as full of weeds as ever.&quot;     Foreshadowing: &quot;On the landing I stumble over my pack, which lies there already made up because I have to leave early in the morning.&quot;     Doggerel: &quot;Give 'em all the same grub and all the same pay.&quot;     Short Utterances: &quot;Life is short.&quot; (Analyse for rhythm and effect.)     Cause and Effect: &quot;They have taken us farther back than usual to a field depot so that we can be re-organized.&quot;     Irony: &quot;...a high double wall of yellow, unpolished, brand-new coffins. They still smell of resin, and piine, and the forest.&quot;     Appositive: &quot;Thus momentarily we have the two things a soldier needs for contentment: good food and rest.&quot;     Caesura: &quot;It is all a matter of habit--even the front-line.&quot;     Onomatopoeia: &quot;The man gurgles.&quot;     Alliteration: &quot;The satisfaction of months shines in his dull pig's eyes as he spits out: 'Dirty hound'&quot;           Euphony: &quot;Now red points glow in every face. They comfort me: it looks as though there were little windows in dark village cottages saying that behind them are rooms full of peace.&quot;           Cacophony: &quot;The storm lashes us, out of the confusion of grey and yellow the hail of splinters whips forth the child-like cries of the wounded, and in the night shattered life groans painfully into silence.&quot;           Slang: &quot;And now get on with it, you old blubber-sticker, and don't you miscount either.&quot; &quot;That cooked his goose.&quot;       Rhetorical devices also include the syllogisms, logical fallacies etc explained at www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/brain/argue.html.    Critics analyze in reverse of how many writers create, except poets, who often start with language and word games.

Kelly\u2019s story is told in the third person but it features flashes of the memories that swamp her mind as she slowly suffocates inside of a car at the bottom of a black lagoon. Kelly is smart, but she is also young and thus lacks experience. She is attractive, but she is not stunning and thus lacks self-confidence. She is eager and well-intended, but she is also susceptible to outside influences. When she meets the Senator, a man who was the focus of her college thesis, she is awed. When he seeks her attention in return, Kelly\u2019s story unfolds. In the telling of Kelly\u2019s tale, Oates explores the ever-resonant themes of power imbalances, particularly between men and women, and the unfortunate influence of societal pressures.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The passage cited above from Black Water embodies these two themes. The passage begins as Kelly first recalls her initial encounter with the Senator, when he told her to call him by his \u201cfirst name \u2013 his diminutive first name - of course\u201d (line 1). This is the first intimation of intimacy between them, an intimacy that the Senator initiates by requesting that she use his shortened first name. The reader never learns the Senator\u2019s name, however, as Kelly doesn\u2019t feel comfortable addressing him with anything other than his formal title: \u201cbut somehow just yet Kelly had not been able to oblige\u201d (line 2). That Kelly cannot \u201cjust yet\u201d see him as anything other than a great man with a terribly important title, despite the casual approach he takes with her throughout the story, demonstrates the power imbalance between them. The words \u201cjust yet\u201d in this sentence are deliberate on Oates\u2019 part: Kelly desperately holds onto her image of the Senator as a mighty man even while she slowly dies as a result of his actions, but she eventually comes to realize that he has abandoned her to save himself.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Senator seems to key-in immediately on Kelly\u2019s almost worshipful view of him and he seeks her affections in return. The sexual tension between them is palpable in this passage, as Oates rhythmically writes: \u201csuch intimacy, together in the bouncing jolting car\u201d (line 3). And yet there is a clear undertone of disgust that begins to emerge as well in this passage, serving as an ominous and foreboding sign: Kelly recalls the Senator boldly approaching her earlier in the day and stealing a kiss: \u201cbeery kisses, that tongue thick enough to choke you\u201d (line 4). That he feels he can approach her and kiss her aggressively so early in their relationship, practically \u201cchoking\u201d her in the process, again suggests the presence of a power imbalance. Oates also uses the visual imagery of the Senator\u2019s \u201cthick\u201d tongue as an analogy for his masculinity. It is his masculine desire to sleep with Kelly \u2013 driving recklessly in part to accomplish this goal \u2013 that leads to Kelly actually \u201cchoking\u201d to death. This particular sentence fragment also represents a shift in dramatic structure, as Kelly and the Senator\u2019s flirtatious and exciting initial relationship now has the markings of a more adversarial and ugly one.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power imbalance between Kelly and the Senator is also present in the descriptions Oates applies to the Senator. These descriptions sound editorial, as if they might appear in newspaper clippings, and they also clearly help to form the images Kelly has of the Senator in her own mind. Oates writes, \u201chere was one of the immune, beside her: he, one of the powerful adults of the world, manly man\u201d (line 5). Oates also writes, \u201cU.S. Senator, a famous face and a tangled history, empowered to not merely endure history but to guide it, control it, manipulate it to his own ends\u201d (lines 6 and 7). In describing the Senator as a \u201cmanly man\u201d with a \u201cfamous face,\u201d Oates uses powerful consonant word pairings to underscore the elevated view Kelly has of the Senator. Because they are also mingled with a journalistic writing style, there is an implication that the media has influenced Kelly\u2019s lofty view of the man and hence her decision to be with him that evening. In these sentences, Oates details more cracks in the Senator\u2019s persona and Kelly\u2019s view of him when Oates uses words like \u201ctangled,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d and \u201cmanipulate.\u201d When Oates describes the Senator as \u201cone of the immune,\u201d she paints a picture of what will come: he will survive, and probably even continue to thrive, while Kelly\u2019s death is nearly a foregone conclusion. This \u201cimmune\u201d man sits \u201cbeside\u201d Kelly, again delineating their two very different positions, both literally and figuratively.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Senator represents both the stereotypical powerful and older man and the stereotypical politician. He is handsome (and of course tall!), but fraying a bit around the edges in his older age. He is confident and accustomed to being the center of attention. In these ways, he is quite the opposite of Kelly, again underscoring their uneven positions. Oates describes the Senator using a journalistic and somewhat poetic style as \u201c\u2026an old-style liberal Democrat out of the 1960\u2019s, a Great Society man with a stubborn and zealous dedication to social reform seemingly not embittered or broken or even greatly surprised at the opposition his humanitarian ideas aroused in the America of the waning years of the twentieth century\u2026\u201d (lines 7, 8, 9 and 10). The Senator, while appearing to be a man who fights for the rights of the underprivileged, is later revealed as a typical hypocritical politician. This is made obvious by his decision to kick Kelly to save himself from the sinking automobile, thinking only of his reputation and making no attempt to save Kelly\u2019s life. Again Oates uses the word \u201cseemingly\u201d deliberately, emphasizing how little we know of the Senator\u2019s underbelly relative to his \u201chumanitarian\u201d public image. Oates also uses the words \u201cstubborn\u201d and \u201czealous\u201d in a positive sentence, and yet these words still have their negative connotations.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kelly allows herself to drive with the drunken Senator. Oates notes the \u201cgiddy smell of alcohol pungent between them\u201d in the car (lines 3 and 4). Kelly has observed the Senator drinking excessively throughout the day, and even agrees to carry a spare drink for him on their doomed drive. She isn\u2019t a stupid woman. In fact, she is rather smart. Yet she succumbs to his wishes and agrees to leave with him because she knows that this is a man who is accustomed to getting his way, and if she doesn\u2019t oblige, she won\u2019t see him again. This dynamic again emphasizes the power imbalance between them and the Senator\u2019s exploitation of that imbalance. Kelly is also foolishly influenced by her horoscope (of all things!), which said, \u201cToo much caution in revealing your impulses and desires to others! For once demand YOUR wishes and get YOUR own way! Your stars are wildly romantic now, Scorpio, after a period of disappointment \u2013 GO FOR IT!\u201d (Page 13). The behavior of Kelly\u2019s friend, who is dating an older male friend of the Senator and has an overt sexual confidence that Kelly envies, also influences her decisions. Kelly succumbs to these outside influences and her unfortunate choice to ignore her own better instincts eventually leads to her death.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Patience Stone , by Atiq Rahimi, shares much in common with Black Water , although it is set in Afghanistan in the midst of a civil war rather than in peaceful and idyllic Maine at the turn of the 21st century. Like Oates, Rahimi explores the theme of power imbalances between men and women and the weighty influence of social norms, although in this case it is not the media or the behavior of a friend, but rather religion, which serves as the focal point. The Patience Stone is set inside a single room in which the unnamed woman\u2019s husband (who is also nameless) lies dying, having been shot during a silly dispute with another jihadist. This \u2018single-space\u2019 approach is similar to Black Water , which takes place inside a single sinking automobile. Both stories also feature female leads whose memories, which span multiple years and settings, form the basis for the storyline.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the troubling passage above from The Patience Stone , the unnamed female lead has just been raped by a young male soldier, who mistakes her for a prostitute. Rahimi relays the woman\u2019s utter sadness and shame in short, rhythmic, emotive and visually stirring sentences: \u201cher eyes fill with tears. Her body huddles up. She wraps her arms around her knees, tucks in her head and wails. A single, heartbreaking wail\u201d (lines 2 and 3). The visual image Rahimi portrays of the woman in these few words is almost animalistic; this is fitting given how the woman has been treated not only by the young man who has just raped her, but also by her husband and her father, among others (including her mother-in-law). As Rahimi details throughout the novel, these men have used religion as an excuse to treat women as subhuman, as animals.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reader comes to learn, however, that the female protagonist in The Patience Stone is not the stereotypical oppressed Muslim woman often portrayed in the western world. Such a portrayal would be far too simple. She is, instead, subject to intense oppression, and yet she also manages to secretly wrench control of her own life in several circumstances. When her husband proves to be barren and yet she faces the blame for their childless marriage and risks being cast aside, she finds another man to impregnate her \u2013 not once, but twice. When her father sells her sister in exchange for gambling debts brought on by quail fighting, she kills his quail. When her husband takes advantage of her while she is (pretending) to be asleep, and then beats her when he discovers that he is covered in her \u201cimpure\u201d blood, the woman later retorts by taking advantage of him while he is unconscious and dying. After she has been raped, the woman turns the horrible event into an opportunity to earn money. She later laughs at the young man who raped her when he returns to see her, belittling him, only to discover that he too has been abused. She actually feels sorry for the young man when he is embarrassed by his weak sexual performance. We learn these secrets, and the complexity of this woman, as she talks to her husband and lives in his presence, while he lays in bed unable to respond and seemingly unconscious. The woman feels a tremendous weight lifted from her shoulders as these secrets unravel. Thus she refers to her husband as her \u201csang-e saboor,\u201d or the patience stone that absorbs the worries of those who confide in it.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A critical turning point occurs in the above passage: \u201cA breeze flutters, as if in response to her cry, lifting the curtains to let the gray fog flood the room. The woman raises her head. Slowly. She does not stand. She still doesn\u2019t raise her eyes to the green curtain. She doesn\u2019t dare. She stares down at the crumpled notes scattering in the breeze\u201d (lines 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In these short utterances, Rahimi appears to use symbolism and personification to invoke the presence of God flooding the room in the form of a \u201cgray fog.\u201d But this isn\u2019t the God the woman has come to know as a cause of her oppression. This is a God who is revealing a new opportunity to the woman, a chance to earn an income and to again wrench back some semblance of control. The woman regains her humanity as she \u201craises her head. Slowly.\u201d She is still afraid of her husband, who has come to be represented by the \u201cgreen curtain\u201d behind which she has hidden him. After this juncture, however, the woman \u201cReappears. Dressed in green and white. Looking more serene\u201d (line 11). Green is commonly used in literature and art to symbolize the earth, and thus life and growth, as well as the colors of Islam and therefore immortality. While the husband is cloaked behind a \u201cgreen curtain,\u201d the woman has been reborn in this scene, unable to be kept down, and she appears \u201cserene\u201d as a result.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the woman unburdens herself of her secrets, she hopes that her husband has come to understand her better, the errors of his ways and the great weight of the oppression to which she has been subject under their religious and societal norms. Unbeknownst to the woman, her husband has heard all of her confessions and her actions. He arises, as if from the dead, and proceeds to kill her. Even as her husband murders her, the woman appears to find some serenity in the unburdening of her secrets and her thoughts as her soul, symbolized by the migrating birds on the curtains, flies away.\u00a0       Everything you learned in Close Textual Analysis I about connotative language must be applied to analysis of the story, narrative voice and sequencing, and dramatic structure so that the form and content are one aesthetic whole.       \u00a0       Story is what happens to a specific person or group of people in a specific place at a specific time.             Dramatic structure is the orchestration of conflict in the story, exaggerated or edited to produce an exciting fight (mental, physical or spiritual) between protagonist(s) and antagonists. In the classical model, this conflict is related to a central dramatic question, objectives, obstacles and plot points characterized by catalyst, commitment, confrontation, chaos/low point, crisis, climax and conclusion. We will also study the Ordinary World/Special World Journey created by Joseph Campbell. Some modernist and postmodernist writers create their own dramatic structure or improvise and ignore it.       Narrative structure is the way the events are sequenced in time and space from the point of view of the narrator in a book and/or camera in a film in such a way that a style is created that expounds the theme , or the way the author feels about the material. In novels and short stories, the narrator or narrators tell the tale in the first or third person, singular and/or plural, and rarely in the second person. In film the narrator can be a real person who occasionally narrates over the action, or simply the POV of the camera.       For example, the CDQ in Pulp Fiction may be \u201cHow will the crime unfold among Vince, Jules, Butch etc., but the two themes are \u201cCrime works if you can keep it a secret\u201d within the chronology of events, or \u201cIt is possible to get out of crime with a spiritual transformation\u201d based on the focus on Jules' epiphany at the conclusion in the way it is filmed. The story of Pulp Fiction is a mundane one of murder and double-dealing throughout three days with drug dealers; but the narrative structure of the stop action, rewind and fast-forward of a VCR turns the story into a dramatic structure with multiple protagonists where a character with little screen time has the character transformation that restructures the story into both an Aristotelian structure with three crises/climaxes, or a monomyth where Jules emerges from the special world to have a transformation. Don't worry if you don't understand all this right away, as it is covered thoroughly\u00a0the course.       \u00a0             In Romeo and Juliet, the story is about these young lovers from the warring Capulet and Montague families; the CDQ is &quot;Will they get married and live happily ever after or not?&quot; and the theme is &quot;True love never runs smoothly,&quot; refering to Shakespeare's attitude toward the material,\u00a0so that the sequencing of events lead to the tragic, untimely deaths of the lovers. \u00a0                   DRAMATIC STRUCTURE         Timed Paradigm modeled on 120 page or 120 minute script  For each plot point, describe exactly what your two protagonists (is that what you want--two journeys?) are doing, what they want, and what obstacles they face. After each plot point, state and refine your CDQ or Central Dramatic Question. If you have two protagonists, you will need 4 graphs of time and space for each one. Make sure all these plot points are actions that can be filmed. Conversations can ensue, images can be symbolic, but create a clear dramatic event that inspires the CDQ.    Set-up  Catalyst or Instigating Event or Inciting Incident 5-15 minutes into film depending on genre. A murder mystery might have the catalyst as credits roll. State CDQ.    Commitment or Plot Point One 30 minutes into film. How has the CDQ become more focused?    Confrontation Mid Point 60 minutes into film\u00a0 This must involve a significant fight with the antagonistic forces. How has the CDQ changed?       Chaos Plot Point Two. The Low Point. p.90. Make us think that all is lost. What has happened to the CDQ? Where are protagonist and antagonist? What is the worst thing that could happen?             Crisis around 105 to 110. Tease the audience with a crisis before the climax. Up the stakes and put the audience on the edge of their seats.         Climax around 110-115. What is the most dramatic thing you can think of? Is this a true catharsis?         Conclusion to 120. Did you answer the CDQ, twist it in a new way, or move to another CDQ?         Obviously there are excellent &quot;slice-of-life&quot; screenplays shot by French or independent directors. However, you are not a director so I recommend that your script have a clearer structure and the more complex it is, the harder you must work on its structure--just like the layers of Adobe Photoshop. To be experimental one must be even more organized.         Space Paradigm inspired by Joseph Campbell but using the work of Chris Vogler and Stuart Voytilla to adapt it to the screen       For this paradigm, list the ARCHETYPAL roles of all characters such as the Hero, or Heroine, Shadow, Threshold Guardian, Trickster, Mentor, Allies, Friends etc. This journey can be symbolic and internal but you still visual images to symbolize the deeper layers.         ORDINARY WORLD In your outline under OW, you are actually talking about the Special World. Really set up an ordinary world with which the audience can identify. Imagine its colors and shapes so that you can also imagine how the Special World differs. Think of films like Blue Velvet that moved from the mundane suburbs to a hallucinatory drug world.         CROSSING THE THRESHOLD is usually around PP1 about 30 pages. Who are the guardians and how do the Hero and Heroine get through?       TESTS with Allies and Enemies       APPROACH THE INMOST CAVE is usually around mid-point, 60 pages in\u00a0 but not necessarily. You have to follow the space in this paradigm. Where is the scariest place and how does the Hero emerge?       What is the REWARD?         CROSSING THE RETURN THRESHOLD back to the ORDINARY WORLD       ELIXIR What did the hero learn from the journey?       RESURRECTION How has he changed?         (I wrote a script where the heroine returned to an EXTRAORDINARY WORLD but it is simpler to follow the paradigm.)         Once you have the two paradigms for one or several protagonists you and your readers (producers and agents) have a clearer idea of dramatic structure. Then you can decide what sequencing techniques to use such a flashback recursive, tandem-competitive, split screen etc based on Aronson's book. The movie Pulp Fiction has a very simply story with a 3-day timeline, a fairly simple dramatic structure, but a complex sequencing inspired by the rewind, fast forward of the VCR age. Now we can be even more complex but if your dramatic structure isn't clear then you come off as disorganized when you do innovative sequencing.         Sequencing is akin to ordering the different courses of a meal you have already cooked with dramatic structure. Do you want the French cuisine with small bits at a time in a predictable order, a Jewish wedding buffet, an Asian sushi style presentation or what? Then eating the meal is what your characters do with scene study based on the exact LANGUAGE you have.                                   Campbell Monomyth: Paradigm of Space                                               Look at your entire script in terms of a spatial journey of the hero or heroine from the Ordinary to the Special and back to the Ordinary World.                                         Timed Plot Points: A Paradigm of Time                                               When you cook a meal you usually are aware of the time it takes to boil, bake, fry, or broil the food. Time is an essential element of drama.                                         Dramatic Structure and Cooking                                               -        Steam-the Aristotelian pressure cooker        When you steam food, you preserve the texture and vitamins, but you make it really hot. If you steam too long, it will wilt or get soggy; if you don't steam enough, part of it remains cold. Coffee benefits from the steaming process and sometimes makes us think more        sharply.               Drama began from our love and need for imitation, harmony and        rhythm. Tragedy is an imitation of characters of noble birth and comedy of        inferior types whose flaws are so exaggerated and real that we can laugh at        them. Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete and of a        certain magnitude, in language embellished with each kind of ornament, through        pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of the audience's emotions.Pity is        aroused by unmerited misfortune; fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves.        Every tragedy must have six parts: Plot, Character, Diction, Thought, Spectacle,        Song. Aristotle feels plot is more important than character because the most        beautiful colors, laid on confusedly, will not give as much pleasure as the        chalk outline of a portrait. Do you agree? Spectacle is the least important.        Diction involves the delivery of words that are either current, or strange, or        metaphorical, or ornamental, or newly-coined, or lengthened, or contracted, or        altered. The perfection of style is to be clear without being mean or too        literal, vulgar, simplistic etc.               Aristotle disliked episodic drama: for tragedy to be worthwhile it          had to be a well constructed story with a beginning, middle and end that          proceeded from action to counteraction by necessity and probability. There is a          strong connection between what he wanted from drama and what he wanted from        rhetoric, although the purpose of tragedy is to purge the emotions. Tragedy must          be simpler and more credible than comedy if it is to move us to tears rather          than laugher. A simple plot is one which takes place without reversal or        recognition. A complex plot has reversals and recognitions which should arise          from the internal structure. The best form of recognition is coincident with          reversal, as in OEDIPUS. Characters must be chosen in such a way that their          actions raise the stakes of the drama. It's better to have family members kill          each other than an enemy kill an enemy because then you can construct scenes          that have the elements of betrayal, jealousy, fear, love etc. as well as anger.      The DEUS EX MACHINA must only be employed for events external to the drama; the       crisis/climax should arise of necessity from the inciting incident, just the way      it's supposed to do in Hollywood screenplays. Every tragedy falls into two      parts: complication and unravelling. Complication is every action that moves to      the turning-point from good to bad fortune and unravelling is that which extends        from the beginning of the change to the end.               An epic structure differs from a tragedy because it has a multiplicity of plots. Epic structure is similar to what we call narrative structure. However as poetry (Homer) it was usually written in the heroic measure. Alexander Pope satirized this form in his mock epic poem THE RAPE OF          THE LOCK in the eighteenth century. Epic tales can be longer, more complicated,          more irrational and fantastical because they are not confined to the stage.               In Western drama the most important thing is a hero who badly wants something        he can't get; in world mythology, it is the call to adventure to undertake a        journey, implying that there are archetypal forces even stronger than the hero's        objective. The first is a paradigm of time, heightened by compressing events in        space into a limited time span; while the second is a paradigm of space that        takes the hero away from the Ordinary World to transform enough in the Special        World so he can bring back an elixir to community. Return, resurrection, rescue,        archetypes, threshold struggle are some of the terms pitted against plot points,        throughlines, premises, reversals, crisis/climax/denouement. While high concept        screenplays involve the community and transformative dramas develop character        transformation, in the Campbell paradigm, the hero's transformation is a        resurrection that brings the community full circle. Campbell's work is motivated        by his spiritual search and his recording of stories that transcend the hero's objective to connect to a more universal truth. Many Western stories stay with        the self, its foibles, flaws, frustrations, and final triumph in getting what it        wants.               The French dramatist, Georges Polti, categorized 36 dramatic situations, that        presumably encompass all the major conflicts between characters in drama. If you        are basing your story on real life, and want to raise the stakes, you can use        one or more of these situations to cook your characters.        Supplication        Crime Pursued by Vengeance        Vengeance Taken for Kindred upon Kindred        Pursuit        Disaster        Falling Prey to Cruelty or Misfortune        Revolt        Daring Enterprise        Abduction|        The Enigma        Obtaining        Enmity of Kinsmen        Rivalry of Kinsmen        Murderous Adultery        Madness        Fatal Imprudence        Involuntary Crimes of Love        Slaying of a Kinsman Unrecognized        Self-sacrificing for an Ideal        Self-sacrifice for Kindred        All Sacrificed for a Passion        Necessity of Sacrificing Loved Ones        Rivalry of Superior and Inferior        Adultery        Crimes of Love        Discovery of the Dishonor of a Loved One        Obstacles to Love        An Enemy Loved        Ambition        Conflict with a God        Mistaken Jealousy        Erroneous Judgment        Remorse        Recovery of a Lost One        Loss of Loved Ones                             Dramatic structure, how the conflict unfolds, is not the same as narrative        structure, the sequence of events in time and space colored by the POV of the        narrator. Dramatic structure is the conflict between protagonist and antagonists        as they fight for their through-lines in response to the Central Dramatic        Question, a visual paradigm similar to falling off a cliff from catalyst to        commitment to confrontation to cataclysm to chaos, crisis, climax and        conclusion, timed by plot points. Emotion is consummated in a catharsis.        Americans still find Aristotle useful now for his catharsis and definition of        unities of space, time and action and priorities of plot, character, thought,        diction, song, spectacle. Shakespeare is good for the gap between expectations        and result, colored by the character's dilemma and necessity to choose, a        sequence of choices, which reveals deep character. While Americans can't compete        with Shakespeare's language, nor do they want to, they have the same epic sense        of crisis and climax and its effect on the community. However, they tend to        prefer transformational drama to a tragedy where the hero dies. The hero is        often a commoner who makes good rather than an aristocrat who falls, reinforcing        the democratic social system of American culture.               While the plot points are a paradigm mainly of time, the monomyth is a        paradigm of space. The circular journey from ordinary to special world and back        and the stages of this journey from call to adventure, to crossing the        threshold, approaching the inmost cave, returning resurrected and getting or        giving the elixir are similar to plot points except that the spatial aspects        represent a circle rather than falling off a cliff, thereby making the set-up        and conclusion a bit longer.               Just like argumentation, drama deals with controversy, conflict and        conversion in a search for truth except that logical fallacies are glorified to        heighten the flaws of the tragic or comic characters. Drama must combust space        and time so deadlines, planting and payoff are necessary to heighten surprise        and mystery, while irony can enhance suspense and make the audience feel smart.        No matter how intricate and discipline the dramatic structure, if the emotions        of pity, fear, laughter or lust are not elicited in the audience, then the        structure will be more like a legal case than a drama that requires catharsis to        transcend the paradigms, just as wonder must transcend prosody in poetry.               World of Time: Plot Points and the Central Dramatic Question-Catalyst,        Commitment, Confrontation, Chaos, Crisis, Climax, Conclusion               World of Space: Campbell Paradigm, Ordinary and Special Worlds, Bore-dinary        and Extraordinary, Call to Adventure, Crossing Thresholds, Meeting with the        Mentor, Approach the Inmost Cave, Reward, Resurrection, Elixir        \u00a0               In summary, cooking transforms your food, as conflict transforms your characters. You decide whether to steam, fry, broil, boil, bake, saute, or serve them raw and bleeding. You also cook, dice, or prepare the fruits, vegetables,        starches, and drinks in your meal. Cooking compresses time in space, which is        what drama does to your action. No matter what, you still have to serve        delicious, appetizing food, so you can't undercook or overcook your characters.               Characterization        Most of you are naturally good at characterization, at discovering, hiding, or uncovering the secrets, lies, obstacles, and wishes that confound and cause action. You are also good at seeing people's qualities and flaws. Therefore you should focus on creating characters in conflict playing out your dramatic structure and acting in scenes with specific activities (stage business) that relate to their overall actions and throughlines. In other words, characters must be firmly embedded in your script.                Good drama gives the audience a taste of death. Even comedy has a taste of         some kind of death. Death helps the audience appreciate life more and fear their         own demise less. To keep the story going for 2 hours, make sure you tease the         audience with appearances of death and take them on a treacherous roller coaster         ride.                 Make sure you relate each character to the Campbell archetypes. While the hero undergoes a momentous transformation as a result of this journey, the other characters serve as archetypes to further this journey, and must fulfill roles such as MENTOR(wise old person offering gifts, motivation, inspiration, guidance, training), THRESHOLD GUARDIAN (obstacle at the gateway to the new world), HERALD (issues challenges and announces the coming of         significant change), SHAPESHIFTER (the protean force that creates surprise,         suspense, obstacles and keeps the audience and the hero guessing, the animus/a         of the hero), SHADOW (the dark side of self but also the villain), TRICKSTER         (challenges authority through laughter, helps hero and audience see the truth by         laughing at it), and of course the hero's HIGHER SELF, in true 12 step fashion.         These types can change masks the way the shapeshifter does, but on the deepest         level, and Hollywood is trying to get &quot;deeper&quot; in the twenty first century, they         represent parts of the buried psyche of the hero. Hence any journey is         ultimately a journey inward as the villains are projections from the hero's id.                 The HERO must elicit empathy/sympathy in the audience so they are willing to         immerse themselves in his journey; he must have human flaws, needs, desires and         capacity for growth-- rather, an almost inhuman capacity for growth because it         has to happen in less than 2 hours. He should be fully active, decisive, capable         of SACRIFICE for his ideals. In this way he shows us how to deal with death,         whether it is literal death or death of a loved one, an idea, a part of oneself.         A hero can journey from the ordinary to the special world and back or from the         wilderness to civilisation and back or anywhere and back as long as something is         learned. This means that Hollywood may be ready to start accepting tragedy as a         genre (especially after 9/11) as long as the hero learns something and the         community is restored and made whole in some way.         Notice how phallic this entire journey is, particularly with the approach to         the inmost cave, passing through the &quot;belly of the whale,&quot; as Campbell would         say. If women were truly free to create their journey, how would it differ?         (Dancing with Wolves?) Maybe the climax is not going into the secret cave but         rather dancing with a wolf and beating him. Maybe it is similar to what I felt         when I was wriestling men and had to win every time as part of the choreography.         Maybe it is moving into a larger space where the light is brighter and the         mountains are higher.         In the pits of the cave, in the muddy, murky miasma of anima, the hero faces         an elusive, ephemeral death. But in the open the heroine battles the strong,         powerful male villain by dancing with him.         At the end of the male journey, there is an apotheosis, a step up from         enthusiasm where the hero becomes god by letting go of his ego. Men like to go         on adventures and come back to the hearth. Women might stay at the hearth but         for those who go on adventures, what are their journeys like? Are there two         kinds of women?         Stuart Voytilla in Myth and the Movies analyzes films in terms of         Vogler's and Campbell's structures and divides genre differently from Dancyger,         in this order: Action Adventure, Western, Horror with Silence of the Lambs here,         Thriller, War, Drama, Romance, Romantic Comedy, Comedy, Sci Fi/Fantasy. What roles do your characters play in terms of genre?                 As I have said many times, drama is related to sex, defecation, injestion,         digestion, birth, death, foreplay, orgasms, fight-- hormones and physical         states. The Campbell Vogler journey is phallic-- a trip to the cave and back.         Women might go to waterfalls to be showered with the sperm of life. They run         with wolves, embrace their anima, or fight animals.         A thriller must be an intriguing puzzle, something to keep the audience         mentally alert, and on the edge of their seats. It would be hard for me to write         a good thriller-- it\u00a0is logical/math, clean, mean, tightly structured, highly         focused.         Hollywood is slowly beginning to embrace the tragedy and now America is         ready, after 9/11. The hero of INSOMNIA dies and the female prodigy takes over.         America has also made satire popular since the war on Iraq.         Shakespeare's tragedies are not completely tragic because they overthrow a         monarch and expose his faults, something many people would want to do,         consciously or unconsciously. We don't have monarchs. WAG THE DOG made fun of         the president but we don't venerate the leader the way other cultures did. Our         leader is our court jester in that movie. The American story is the little guy         makes good-- the Rocky myth-- and that is also an immigrant's story, but now         America is ready for other myths and Hollywood is greedy to maintain its         hegemony on the global storytelling market.                 \u00a0         Is your heroine empathic and sympathetic and to which audience?                 By comparing characters to food, we determine how they were found, gathered,         or killed from the story, how they will be cooked or prepared in the dramatic         structure, how they will be sequenced in time and space or displayed on the         dinner table, how they will be eaten, digested, eliminated, and metabolized by         the audience or reader. So characters as food relate directly to story         structure, genre, and audience. But there are other ways of comparing them.         Objects, Musical Instruments, Animals : Act, Hear and Feel                  Food analogies aren't the only ways to create, develop, and orchestrate your         characters. By comparing them to household appliances, you get a clear idea of         how they act in a situation. A scissor personality is different from a vacuum         cleaner,a broom, a washing machine, or a toilet bowl cleaner. Once you see how your characters         clean up you may be better able to predict their actions in a scene.         Not everyone speaks the same way.         Resonance, pitch, timbre, phrasing and vocabulary distinguish each character so a useful exercise is to assign a musical instrument to each character's voice. A melodious harp plays differently         on our ears and psyches than a relentless drum, a schreechy violin, an ethereal         flute, a banging piano, a twanging guitar, or a new age synthesizer.         Every time you create dialogue, hear the sounds of these distinct instruments         and let your characters respond accordingly.         In drama, we want our characters to feel instinctively and act with power.         Therefore, if you assign an animal to each character, you will know how they fight, eat, have sex, and escape. A snake curls up lasciviously on the rock in the sun but will stand up, hiss, and         bite if attacked; a mosquito is almost invisible until it delivers its itchy bite; a fish swims fluidly, seeking food everywhere, even on the end of a lethal hook; the gentle, slow-moving         elephant can crush life with a single ponderous step; the gazelle is beautifulto look at, but if you approach, it will run away with lightning speed. The wormy caterpillar metamorphoses         into a beautiful butterfly.The lizard blends into its environment.Your pet cat can be dressed up for Halloween. Before you write a scene, assemble your characters, know what food, object,         instrument, and animal they are, understand the plot objectives of the scene,         but let the characters surprise, based on their essences. Serials, soaps and sitcoms have the same characters returning every day, changing superficially and reacting in somewhat predictable patterns.         Archetypes are classic character types such as the Shadow, the Hero, the         Shapeshifter, the Mentor, whose essence is related to the role they play in the         dramatic journey.                 Stereotypes are contemporary character types flattened and exaggerated to fit         a socially identifiable role. They work best in satire, slapstick, or to provide         comic relief in tragedy. If the hero of your transformational drama is a         stereotype, you are in trouble.         Three-Dimensional Characters         Height, width and volume? This is a crazy         nomenclature but what it means is that characters have dimensions and depth;         they break stereotypes, they often act unpredictably, they have many sides to         their personality, they have secrets that they hide or lie about, and they         change as the story unfolds. A main character may have a kaleidoscopic         personality, sounding like a violin in one scene, or a harp in the next, acting         like scissors with a girlfriend, but a vacuum cleaner with his professor.         Relationships         In drama, the character is only as good as         its relationship to others and to the plot. Food can't be digested without water         within and without, therefore, you must examine your characters for their         strengths, weaknesses, needs, desires, and objectives that will force them to         fit themselves into others like a jigsaw puzzle. As a liquid, water is different         from wine or coffee.         Transformation is\u00a0 how characters are transformed by the dramatic structure of the work, the way meat is cooked in the oven. The protagonist is usually the character who is cooked         the most.         Objectives         In real life we may have many objectives or         goals, some which may never be fulfilled. Sometimes we get so disappointed we         stop fighting and just roll with the punches or submit to the blowing wind with         faith or que sera sera. Therefore it may seem unnatural to sustain a         protagonist's or antagonist's single objective relentlessly through an entire         story. In real life many believe more in destiny, luck chance or God than in the         power of individual will. We can be responsible for the small things, the daily         tasks, but at any moment we can get sick, or be subject to an earthquake,         hurricane, fire or whatever. These deus ex machina events don't always create         the best drama. In real life there are very few devils or angels. Most people         are a mixture of the two, capable of evil and good, and the most self-righteous         people can usually do the most harm.         Some people do evil because their brains are so brilliant they explode and go         haywire; others because they dissociate and can't imagine, killing as if a game         from a distance enjoying the power and control like Richard III; some people         like the sexuality of killing and become addicted to that; some people are         fascinated with death and want to martyr themselves. Some people are sorry for         what they did, some don't feel what they did was wrong, and some are happy to be         branded evil. Satan was discharged from heaven when he disobeyed. He was one of         the angels, as righteous as any.         Throughline: Macbeth wants so badly to be king he is willing to murder to get         it. Jan wants so badly to be with Jalal she is willing to pursue him to outer         space. Jalal wants so badly to be with Jan that he compromises his jihadhi plot.                 The problem with writing is that we can subconsciously put ourselves in the         protagonist's position and create a wish fulfillment scenario that would make us         reluctant to make things hard for our characters, to maim or kill them, to grind         them against each other. We live in an ideal world that needs conflict so what         to do? I could do the elevator irritation exercise. Take each character and lock         them in an elevator with another for an indefinite period of time. Then make         hellish triangles of lethal combos. Screenwriting is the tip of the iceberg, but         good readers know whether or not there is an iceberg or just a floating piece of         ice.         Story isn't the same as structure.         To milk a scene or live in the moment is so different from planning a       structure. You must let the moment take you where you don't want to go. You can         always revise a structure. The unfolding of a drama is a striptease: if you just         pull all your clothes off at once, you eliminate suspense, mystery, and the         ability to tease the audience, to prolong their final satisfaction. Narrative,         story and structure are different things.         As with research papers, writers are not able to ask enough irritating         questions early in the process regarding motivations, objectives, interactions,         conflicts, results. Writing is problem solving but one must challenge oneself         with tough problems in the beginning. We like to be optimistic, superficial,         cheerful, avoid conflict in favor of peace in many of our daily interactions,         but to create drama we have to twist every situation the way Socrates would to         see if it is the best. If the story is personal, we may want to have the         antagonist or the chief ally become the protagonist so that we don't just         project our victimization.

Americans want         their characters to get better, not older and weaker as they do in real life.         They have a puritan need to learn something from the story to make their own         lives better-- how to give up an addiction, fight an external or internal enemy         and win, get a better job, resolve their relationship problems. But in real life         the law of entropy usually has people getting older, fatter, weaker, losing         their minds and their bank accounts, their dignity and their hopes. In Cairo         Trilogy characters peak with their marriages and births or even martyrdoms but         very few people have the pollyanna triumphs of American cinema.         Americans like realism but not depressing naturalism. They like to leave the         cinema or put the book down with renewed energy and hope to conquer their own         troubles. They also like to be entertained and while they expect these moral         lessons embedded in their stories they don't want to work too hard to learn         things. They read or watch primarily for the twists and turns of the story, the         amusing or heart-wrenching actions of the characters, the sex and violence that         keeps things moving. I read novels from other cultures and historical periods to         learn about them but these are rarely popular.         The Cairo Trilogy is depressing to Americans but hopeful to Arabs because it         reaffirms the repetitious cycle of family life and the omnipotent unity of         Allah. Individuals don't need the triumphs necessary in Western literature.         Different cultures require different levels of conflict, honesty, politeness         and vulgarity. Americans may be disgusted by the two-faced behavior of Ahmad in         Cairo Trilogy, the stern patriarch who rules his family like a tyrant and the         drunk philanderer who is the life of the party. However Arabs may be disgusted         by the outspoken, in-your-face Americans who tell it like it is spitting out         Protein-the main meat, amino acids, making muscle-is muscle         the objective or throughline?         Protagonists are the protein--they build muscle, repair tissue, require lots         of water to digest, and have the most long lasting effects on the audience's         metabolism.Proteins can be meat, fish,nuts, legumes, or dairy         products.         If your main character is modeled on milk,how would that differ from a steak protagonist?         Carbohydrates-society-powers that be-antagonists?         Junk food is the antagonist because it slowly poisons us.               THE GAP: You can fix a lot of writing that has a bad overall         structure by working on the gap between expectations and result, where the         characters harbor conflicting objectives, needs from the people in the scene so         they don't talk at each other, secrets that must cover up with lies in order to         flatter, persuade and cajole. Then there is the relative knowledge of the         audience so that mystery, suspense and surprise are created through the gap.         Interaction and Dialogue         While the following may be okay in some instances, they cannot substitute for         drama: 1) Sounding off: So much of our daily interaction is lyrical or bitching         about life, our problems, worrying about what we should or shouldn't do,         reliving guilt from the past with another person in such a way that we are not         always conscious of what we want from that person, if anything. This can waste         time in a novel or screenplay although it can reveal character if used as         motivations for objectives and actions. Memoirs are full of these lyrical         laments. It's fine in poetry when cased in beautiful language but it can get         really tedious if allowed to stalemate a story. 2) Exposition: explaining what         already happened either with a character or the narrator. Some of this is         necessary but it can't take over the scene. 3)Utilitarian intercourse: which         means the mundanity of daily interaction--greeting, shopping, going to the bank,         driving the car, taking the subway. My students tend to have entire scenes just         going to a bar or waking up in the morning. It's okay to start in these         locations with these interactions but the characters must get into a dramatic         situation and the narrator or camera must develop a real story. 4) Gratuitous         violence: another easy way out is to have someone shot without a sufficiently         dramatic situation or to have warlike actions without the emotional conflict,         unless a satire is being developed. To milk the present drama must be created:         two or more characters want conflicting things from each other, related to their         throughlines. In real life we often avoid these situations or get out of them         when they occur, as they are uncomfortable.         \u00a0Nutritional Balance         Character Orchestration         Everyone can't be a star, nor have the same will, energy, voice,         body, and commitment. If you only eat protein, you will get kidney disease; if         you only eat sugar, diabetes. Audiences require nutritional balance--all kinds         of interesting characters, but a hierarchy where the protagonist and the chief         antagonist take up most of the story. You don't have to cook fruits and         vegetables as long as meat. Bread bakes for a long time, but at a relatively low         temperature.\u00a0                                                                              Theme and Sequencing                                                                      While dramatic structure relates to central dramatic question, narrative          structure relates to theme, the author's attitude towards the material.          Narrative structure is described by the voice of the narrator-omniscient,          limited, first or third person, non-human, personified or human, distance from          the story; the sequence of events in time-linear, recursive or other kinds of          flashback, superimposed time or tandem competitive, past imperfect or          repetition, out of time in some kinds of expository, lyrical or descriptive          writing which may include the emotional subjunctive, conditional or future time          expressed in the possibilities of branching narratives and indeterminate          endings; and a spatial existence that can be real, imaginary, in the head,          superimposed space or disembodied.                   What are the unique qualities of print, oral communication, internet/small screen, or movies/big screen that create certain kinds of narrative and dramatic structures? Dramatic structures are the          same in all media but narrative structures differ. The Internet is most          conducive to branching narratives, tandem competitive time and superimposed          space. How do written and oral communication differ? Written communication lends          itself to the invisible, omniscient narrator but oral communication insists on          the real character of the narrator as in Arabian Nights . Film has          glorified the flashback and recursive narrative but branching narratives with          indeterminate future are not popular. Run Lola Run is more of a rewind          of three stories from beginning to end, rather than a future oriented piece.          Film can speed up or slow down but it lives in the immediate present even when          flashing back.                   There are many kinds of sequencing already used in contemporary films but more that haven't even been dreamed of. For a discussion of all elements of Flashback sequencing, consult Aronson's book. Here are a few kinds of sequencing I have used in various projects:          RECURSIVE: The present is relatively static and the past is used to solve a          problem in the present, even if that is to recapture lost time as in Proust, or          to stop the plague in Ancient Greece in Oedipus Rex . While the climax of the          play occurs when Oedipus plucks out his eyes, the present action up until then          has been mainly conversation about dramatic events in the past. When the past is          plucked, it is not replayed in a realistic, linear fashion, but filtered through          the lens of the present. At the end the digs into the past cause the present to          change somewhat. This is often told in first person or through the eyes of a          main character. Flashback films and written memoirs, static plays like Oedipus          are its forms. How do these forms differ and how do they translate into each          other? Recursive is the basis of psychoanalysis where patient and psychiatrist          sit in a static present using events in the past to trigger feelings to be          catharsized and analyzed in order to solve problems for better action in the          future. Oedipus Rex only won second prize in the playwriting competition in          Ancient Greece, so some feel this kind of storytelling isn't dramatic enough.          This is the basis of reflection, of the thinking we do in memoirs or at the end          of the day. But it doesn't work well with multiple narrators or a huge          sociological vision or a lot of action. It is for sensory recall, problem          solving.          Thwarted dream, case history, life changing event. Ivan Ilyich. Rewind.          TANDEM COMPETITIVE: Stories can be in tandem without competing-sharing the          same space or the same time or the same characters with some different factor.          In my novel, similar characters appear in different space. It seems as if they          are in the same time because they occupy the same novel, but one is in the          active, impressionistic, dreamlike present and one the past imperfect, one in          the eternal present of dreams and one in a specific period in society and          history. They compete when they rival each other for truth from the Reader's          POV. There must be a reason why stories are told in tandem. In real life, two          versions of the same story are constantly competing in our minds, a phenomenon          which reaches its extreme state in bipolar illness where the same state of          events can be interpreted as depressing or uplifting, depending on the mood, or          actions are constructed to reap those same results, depending on the mood. In          other words, something exists before the story because the story is simply how          specific people engage in certain events in a specific time and place.          Therefore, their objectives, moods, abilities and proclivities as well as social conditions are set before the story occurs. Hence different moods and objectives          can actually create somewhat different stories. We sometimes see scenes on split          screen or split stage or alternating chapters of narrators in a novel. This          narrative style is particularly disturbing as we don't know what kind of truth          to accept and our mood is constantly jarred by the constant switches. Yet this          is exactly what happens in psychosis.          LINEAR: Linear is the most common kind of storytelling in which a beginning,          middle and end follows similar linearity in time and space. However, in dreams,          linear storytelling does not necessarily have a cause-effect as is commonly          understood. In Hollywood screenplays, script doctors are brought in to make sure          there is a causal relationship to the scenes. Usually linear storytelling is          told by one narrator, whether first, third or the camera, but in pass the ball          linear narrative, multiple narrators carry the same story in sequence, the way          storytellers passed tales through the desert from oasis to oasis through          different caravans. They tried hard to be true to the story, but each          storyteller obviously colored the tale based on his perceptions and values. In          my second novel I chose 18 nonhuman narrators or human extensions, as McLuhan          would say, to carry the story. This is a technique still used today by writers          like Naguib Mahfouz, Yusuf al Qa'id in War in the Land of Egypt and Orhan Pamuk          in My Name is Red. You can have multiple narrators without a linear story as in          Akhenaten and some of Faulkner's work, but pass the ball linear is like the game          broken telephone where narrators try to pace their addition to the story          embedded in sequence within its entire history. This gives tremendous importance          to the story but protects it from the fallacies of omniscient narrators like          those of Tolstoi. Pass the ball linear doesn't lend itself that well to film          although it is possible it could be done-something as disciplined as War in the          Land of Egypt might work well. My second novel would be hard to film and keep          all those narrators. Some things are too difficult to visualize in this          narrative. Films and plays take place in a linear fashion but they can refer to          events that occur out of sequence in time.          CONGLOMERATE:It seems that in conglomerate narrative, there must be an active          throughline in the present that covers winter to winter -one year which is the          surface of the rock. Then the layers are the back stories. How does this differ          from recursive narrative? Recursive features the past to solve a problem in the          present like Oedipus Rex; while conglomerate has a hard active linear present          that covers layers of secrets, lies, and history in the past. Conglomerate is          neither tandem nor competitive, nor does it deal with the future. The past is          not imperfect past but singular events that influence the present. Is          conglomerate the right word? The idea is that there is a superficial story with          deeper stories underneath, some of which may be too disgusting, disappointing,          depressing or disarming for the Reader or Viewer to stomach. For example, soap          operas skim the surface of narrative, idealizing characters and romanticizing          situations by avoiding depressing details. How many people lie dying with          perfect hair and make-up? In a hypertext story there can be the top layer of          narrative for everyone, then layers underneath which symbolize gossip,          pettiness, uncomfortable facts, and finally those things that are usually          censored. This would be one way to deal with Internet censorship. This is          different from the usual hypertext story of branching narratives where different          future outcomes are envisioned.                 Parallel structures like The Hours are not sub-plots. The danger         here is to be choppy if the sequencing isn't right and there aren't enough          similarities or differences between the stories. It is like comparison and        contrast in literary criticism. Choppy, flowing, choppy, flowing. But if the          narrators argue, if the stories bleed into each other for a reason, it gives the        whole story more depth. The Matrix has a number of parallel structures.Instead of repetition, it might be good to spiral the action so that when          characters revisit the scene they attack the problem in a different way.         Sometimes the event is seen in flashback.                 The Unraveling-mystery structure is used with whodunits. The skill involves          laying clues throughout the film and then learning the truth in the third act.                   In Memento the whole film is a flashback so that it is a reverse structure.        The trick is to keep the audience asking a central dramatic question. There must        always be a puzzle for the audience to solve. In a circular structure there must          still be linear parts. Pulp fiction has a looping structure of        beginning-end-middle and more. Non-linear stories require more structure than usual so that don't break up,        dissolve or fly into different directions. Good drama combusts time. Even with different time periods like The        Hours, it is possible to carry objects like the flowers and book from one        setting to the next.       It mustn't feel like a string of stories pieced together from disparate        places, similar to a bad research paper without a central thesis.          A good sequencing technique is to imply an action in a that is carried out or          frustrated or somehow commented upon in b. Or cut from an object in one to a          similar one in the other. Or the setup of a joke is one scene and the punchline in the next. Just as dance routines can be choppy if the movements aren't connected,         scenes can be choppy if they have no relationship to each other.         Use your imaginations to come up with the best sequence. I get inspired by books like Einstein's Dreams by physicist writer Alan Lightman whom I met at a media in transition conference where I was disguising the tandem-competitive and conglomerate sequencing of a recent novel that had just been published. Einstein's Dreams describes so many       ways of living time as if it were one day, going backwards, rushing to Apocalypse,        turned into space, or torn between biological and mechanical time.The        smaller the space of the medium, the wider the world of it story-books and         computers.\u00a0                   Why do the tenses of our language support the uni-directional nature of time,          running madly in only one direction, organizing life into hierarchies of what's          remembered and what's hoped for?                   Why does Western classical drama observe the unities of space, time and          action with a rising and falling arc of energy that is supposed to create an          emotional catharsis?                   What happens if a story starts at the end and ends at the beginning?                   Can a story exist in the present with no directionality or get caught up in          a centrifugal or centripetal force?                   What kind of timespace distortions occur with the branching directions of          hyperfiction?                   What happens when we infuse narrative with black holes, big bangs, big          crunches, asymmetries and relativities, arrows and loops?                   How can basic principles of physics such as ten dimensions, Stephen          Hawking's observations, Einstein's general theory of relativity, the latest          developments in thermodynamics, quantum theory and cosmology influence creative          writing and literature majors with no scientific background?\u00a0                   Rhythm is determined by how long you stay in each scene and dynamics the quality of your transitions, just like dance or serving courses.          If you take too long eating a huge pasta dish, you won't have room or time for anything else.\u00a0                   Levels of Truth          How is your creation related to the real world? A         documentary records the real world as is without any attempt to          make up a story. Naturalism creates fiction or film that          resembles reality, even if it is ugly or aesthetically displeasing.   Realism manipulates reality artistically but extracts some truth from it, as in Greek and Shakespearean tragedy. Fantasy adds an element or elements of setting, being or behavior that could not occur in real life, although the basic world may be realistic.   Science Fiction constructs an entire imaginary world, although characters or forces may        resembler real life. Surrealism superimposes extraordinary over        ordinary reality, often producing incongruous, wild and wonderful images.          Impressionism gives us fragments of reality to fill in with our        imagination, similar to what happens when we recall our dreams. It is the        writer's job to believe in the world she creates and describe it so that the        reader or audience experiences a suspension of disbelief          that          allows them to treat this world as even more important to them than the real         world, while engaged in reading the book or viewing the film.                                       You have one large, unwieldy document with a patchwork of close textual analyses and forum entries throughout the semester. How can you organize it into a thoughtful inquiry paper that links your thesis to the readings this semester? This lesson will help you identify, define, and refine claims of value, link the claims to your close textual analyses, and draw up an outline.               Linking and Synthesis                      This course develops two kinds of thinking--close textual analysis and synthesis through linking. Your weekly CTs, based on the three Lessons I wrote on the Music of Words, Story/Structure/Sequencing, and Characterization, are good for the introductory level of this course, although you could do more situating the passage in the overall dramatic structure and relating style to content.       Linking or synthesis is the objective of the final forum paper. The World Wide Web is based on linking and it is an essential tool to help us think better as our brains are a web on synaptic connections.       Barbara' Hoblitzell's paper th linking Wild Ginger to her education theme is a succinct, 2-page example of how to link your CTs to your forum topic. The challenge for Barbara will be to link all the books with more complex connotative language. Please look at her paper below.\u00a0       \u00a0    Close Textual Analysis:     Wild Ginger, Anchee Min     \u00a0     \u00a0    1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I remembered a story from One-Eye Grandpa.\u00a0He said he\u2019d once had a hard time explaining to a    2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 group of village children what a book was. They had never seen one.\u00a0He was a veteran at that    3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 time and was passing through town. I was sure Evergreen and I would have made a difference.    4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What a pity.     Short utterance     \u00a0    While this passage is short and lacks the color and imagery that lends itself so well to close textual analysis, I am drawn to it because it is at once both a frank and honest statement, coupled with the childlike hopes and dreams of a romantic. This passage takes place as Maple spends her eighteenth birthday in jail, serving time for a crime she has not only not committed, but for which she was accused in an act of revenge and betrayal by her best friend, Wild Ginger.\u00a0She is torn between her lasting feelings for her friend, the impending loss of her lover, and the dreams she once held for her future.    While it is at this juncture in the story that Maple acknowledges the love triangle that had formed between Wild Ginger, Evergreen and herself, I found myself focusing on the brief reference to One-Eyed Grandpa\u2019s experience with the village children who could not imagine what a book was because they had never seen one.\u00a0While Mao denounced intellectualism and hijacked the educational system in China for his own political aims, it is doubtful that the education of the village children had been curtailed, as they likely had never had access to books, classrooms, or teachers.    In my forum, Knowledge is Power, I have asserted that knowledge and power are derived from a multitude of sources and are used for as many purposes.\u00a0As other forums have explored, the experience of human life in harsh circumstances is the catalyst for many defining actions, decisions, philosophical and political leanings, as well as the ultimate formation of one\u2019s truest self.\u00a0For many, life in harsh circumstances gives birth to an intractable sense of dignity and/or spirituality that also serves to enable one to endure and persevere.\u00a0Under those conditions, the knowledge gained is not gleaned from didactic sources, great works of literature, or another\u2019s expertise.\u00a0It flows from within, from each person\u2019s experience of the world and the moment they are living.\u00a0As we examined the sources of knowledge and power, and more importantly, how it was wielded, there emerged vast array of examples from across the literary clusters.    Danielle Chauncey observed that \u201cIn Ulysses, James Joyce confronts religion head on and early through a conversation between Haines and Stephen: \u2018Either you believe or you don't, isn't it? \u00a0Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a personal God. \u00a0You don't stand for that, I suppose?\u2019 \u00a0    To which Stephen responds: \u2018You behold in me a horrible example of free thought.\u2019 Considering the book itself is a reflection on Odysseus in the Odyssey who encountered immortal God after immortal God, Stephen seems to believe in the authority of God, whereas Haines is self-reliant. \u00a0Haines is what many people are today, not atheist or a pagan, but floating between two movements. \u00a0One that wants to leave the church behind, and one that can't.\u201d    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eric Ayers shared his impression of \u201c\u2026The Bluest Eye, [wherein] the narrator's big sister was the source of her knowledge.\u00a0 The source of our knowledge must be chosen carefully.\u00a0 One has to have a variety of sources to get the best perspective on any given idea.\u00a0 America is the greatest country in the world.\u00a0 I say that because this is all I know, but I've never lived in Denmark or Singapore.\u00a0 My source of knowledge is the small part of the world that I've seen so far.\u00a0 This is not a very educated perspective.\u201d    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ryan Hinricher noted that \u201cIn Ayn Rand's Anthem, we see the character Equality 7-2521 discover electricity. His attempt to deliver this to the Council of Scholars is struck down as evil.\u00a0\u2018And if this great thing shall lighten the toil of men,\u2019 said Similarity 5-0306, \u2018then it is a great evil, for men have no cause to exist save in toiling for other men.\u2019 Then collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box.\u00a0 \u2018This thing,\u2019 they said, \u2018must be destroyed.\u2019 ... later in the text, after changing his name from Equality 7-2521 to Promethus, he declares,\u00a0\u2018I have learned the power of the sky was known to men long ago; they called it Electricity. It was the power that moved their greatest inventions. \u00a0It lit this house with light that came from those globes of glass on the walls. \u00a0I have found the engine which produced this light. \u00a0I shall learn how to repair it and how to make it work again. \u00a0I shall learn how to use the wires which carry this power. \u00a0Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my home, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light as a cobweb, more impassable than a wall of granite...(Loc 849).\u2019 His attempt to deliver the invention as a gift was only seen as a threat by the oppressive Council. \u00a0He felt it worthy to retreat with it to the forest and make his own way. \u00a0Still his plan was to use it for defensive means only.\u201dJulia Keefer opined \u201cIronically, the most powerful character in God Dies by the Nile is Zakeya, an illiterate peasant with no formal knowledge, who\u00a0ends up having the power and the hoe to kill the Mayor. In Ulysses, all Stephen's bookish knowledge seems to get him tangled up in all kinds of internal conflicts and dilemmas, almost like Othello, another character of extreme knowledge and intelligence.    \u00a0In Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, Reading Lolita in Tehran, and Red Azalea, knowledge is forbidden. To survive you must hide or burn it. This is the case in One Man's Bible where Gao Xi Jiang burned all his books before the Red Guard entered his house. In Soul Mountain the protagonist finds knowledge buried in the earth, deep inside the mountains of China, deep inside the many pronouns that make up himself. In Night and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, characters survive by concentrating on the details of the present moment. Too much knowledge of their fate might render them impotent, and dead. But this doesn't mean knowledge isn't good. The AUTHORS of these books had extreme knowledge but maybe it was so painful to them that they empowered characters who lacked some of their intelligence. Saadawi does that all the time.\u201d\u00a0Keefer followed up with a challenge: \u201cWhat is your definition of knowledge? Does it include all cognitive domains and sensory experience? Then Zakeya has more knowledge than previously thought.\u201d    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, I have always applied the broadest definition to the concept of knowledge, recognizing that people both possess\u00a0innate understanding of certain things (e.g., intuition, emotional intelligence, etc.) and acquire new knowledge through every experience.\u00a0 How individuals incorporate and apply that knowledge over the course of their lives varies greatly, as does the power each person derives from what they know.\u00a0 Such is the case for Maple, as her education has been limited by the precepts of Mao and her knowledge is continually challenged and censored until she is nearly unable to discern her own experience.\u00a0In the end, she is able to reflect on all that she has seen, heard and felt throughout her tumultuous teenage years and decide for herself her truth.&quot;          Content Notes   Perfume is an historical literary thriller because the narrator is inside the criminal protagonist's head, shares his pathology with the reader, and there is no mystery to solve just a linear plot that unfolds with suspense. As a screenwriter, Suskind is an organized, talented dramatist and this novel is meticulously researched and carefully structured according to classical dramatic paradigms. But the idea is novel and the character unique is literature. It also tells us a lot about the Enlightenment and eighteenth century France.               Authors' Words                      The following quotes have been taken from the writing of major twentieth century writers. If you read through them all at once, what overview do you get of this century intellectually? Now, go back and savor each quote. Imagine who might have written it. Then find out.       The future belongs to crowds.    When the old God goes, they pray to flies and bottletops.    Hell is other people.    Writing and reading...require being alert and ready for unaccountable beauty, for the intricateness or simple elegance of the writer's imagination, for the world that imagination evokes. Both require being mindful of the places where imagination sabotages itself, locks its own gates, pollutes its vision. Writing and reading mean being aware of the writer's notions of risk and safety, the serene achievement of, or sweaty fight for, meaning and response-ability.    Whatever may be their use in civilised societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action.    Poets are men who refuse to utilize language.    Some say it is best not to go near the center of time. Life is a vessel of sadness, but it is noble to live life, and without time there is no life. Others disagree. They would rather have an eternity of contentment, even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly mounted in a case.    &quot;Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates success.&quot; That is a man's sentence;...it was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman's use....Moreover a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been made by men out of their own needs for their own uses. There is no reason to think that the form of the epic or the poetic play suits a woman any more than the sentence suits her. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands-- another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels.       The &quot;engaged&quot; writer knows that words are actions.   Writers are among the most sensitive, the most intellectually anarchic, most representative, most probing of artists. The ability of writers to imagine what is not the self, to familiarize the strange and mystify the familiar, is the test of their power. The languages they use and the social and historical context in which these languages signify are indirect and direct revelations of that power and its limitations.   Why write? Each one has his reasons: for one, art is a flight; for another, a means of conquering.   One of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the need of feeling that we are essential in relation to the world.   All our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.   ...a great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all its faculties.   Like a domestic animal, time doesn't move without human beings' strict supervision.   When the words form under his pen, the author doubtless sees them, but he does not see them as the reader does, since he knows them before writing them down. The function of his gaze is not to reveal, by stroking them, the sleeping words which are waiting to be read, but to control the sketching of the signs.   What does death matter? Communism is the truth. Because they appear almost always in conjunction with representations of black or Africanist people who are dead, impotent, or under complete control, these images of blinding whiteness seem to function as both antidote for and meditation on the shadow that is companion to this whiteness-- a dark and abiding presence that moves the hearts and texts of American literature with fear and longing.   Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images.   Race has become metaphorical-- a way of referring to and disguising forces, events, classes, and expressions of social decay and economic division far more threatening to the body politic than biological &quot;race&quot; ever was.   It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech for anything written with that conscious bias is doomed to death. It ceases to be fertilised. ...Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the act of creation can be accomplished.   Reading seems, in fact, to be the synthesis of perception and creation.   In this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time and there is body time. The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum of iron that swings back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The second squirms and wriggles like a bluefish at bay. The first is unyielding, predetermined. The second makes up its mind as it goes along.... Where the two times meet, desperation. Where the two times go their separate ways, contentment. ... Each time is true but the truths are not the same.   There is no romance free of what Herman Melville called &quot;the power of blackness,&quot; especially not in a country in which there was a resident population, already black, upon which the imagination could play; through which historical, moral, metaphysical, and social fears, problems, and dichotomies could be articulated. The slave population, it could be and was assumed, offered itself up as surrogate selves for meditation on problems of human freedom, its lure and its elusiveness. This black population was available for meditations on terror-- the terror of European outcasts, their dread of failure, powerlessness, Nature without limits, natal loneliness, internal aggression, evil, sin, greed.  \u00a0   I am therefore I think.       In order to know himself, each person carries his own Book of Life, which is filled with the history of his life. ...With time, each person's Book of Life thickens until it cannot be read in its entirety....Some have stopped reading altogether. ... Such people walk with the limber stride of their youth. Such people have learned how to live in a world without memory.       Existence precedes essence.     I fear for you young people because you do not understand how strong is the bond of kinship. You do not know what it is to speak with one voice. And what is the result? An abominable religion has settled among you. A man can now leave his father and his brotheres. He can curse the gods of his fathers and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes mad and turns on his master.      For detailed lectures on this, consult Ulysses versus Satanic Verses lecture.    \u00a0    First of all, let's examine a few of the most common narrative and stylistic devices found in postmodern texts:\u00a0       1. Postmodern literature often uses confusing chronology, jumping from one historical period to another and from one character's thoughts to another character's thoughts without any indication at all.\u00a0       2. In 350 B. C. Aristotle wrote that every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. With postmodern texts, that's not always the case. Postmodern writers often leave their stories open-ended, with no satisfying conclusion, or the book concludes by making a reference back to the beginning, thereby offering circularity.\u00a0       3. Postmodern stories and novels often rely on parody or satire, revealing little tolerance for aspects of our culture that typically evoke reverence.\u00a0This parody or satire is partly what got Rushdie in trouble with the Islamists.       4. The postmodern text, at heart, reveals skepticism about the ability of art to create meaning, about the ability of history to reveal truth, about the ability of language to convey reality. All of that skepticism leads to fragmented, open-ended, self-reflexive stories that are intellectually fascinating but often difficult to grasp on the first read.     Structuralism is appealing to some critics because it adds a certain objectivity, a SCIENTIFIC objectivity, to the realm of literary studies (which have often been criticized as purely subjective/impressionistic). This scientific objectivity is achieved by subordinating &quot;parole&quot; to &quot;langue;&quot; actual usage is abandoned in favor of studying the structure of a system in the abstract. Thus structuralist readings ignore the specificity of actual texts and treat them as if they were like the patterns produced by iron filings moved by magnetic force--the result of some impersonal force or power, not the result of human effort.      In structuralism, the individuality of the text disappears in favor of looking at patterns, systems, and structures. Some structuralists (and a related school of critics, called the Russian Formalists) propose that ALL narratives can be charted as variations on certain basic universal narrative patterns.      In this way of looking at narratives, the author is canceled out, since the text is a function of a system, not of an individual. The Romantic humanist model holds that the author is the origin of the text, its creator, and hence is the starting point or progenitor of the text. Structuralism argues that any piece of writing, or any signifying system, has no origin, and that authors merely inhabit pre-existing structures (langue) that enable them to make any particular sentence (or story)--any parole. Hence the idea that &quot;language speaks us,&quot; rather than that we speak language. We don't originate language; we inhabit a structure that enables us to speak; what we (mis)perceive as our originality is simply our recombination of some of the elements in the pre-existing system. Hence every text, and every sentence we speak or write, is made up of the &quot;already written.&quot;      By focusing on the system itself, in a synchronic analysis, structuralists cancel out history. Most insist, as Levi-Strauss does, that structures are universal, therefore timeless. Structuralists can't account for change or development; they are uninterested, for example, in how literary forms may have changed over time. They are not interested in a text's production or reception/consumption, but only in the structures that shape it.      In erasing the author, the individual text, the reader, and history, structuralism represented a major challenge to what we now call the &quot;liberal humanist&quot; tradition in literary criticism.      The HUMANIST model presupposed:   1.) That there is a real world out there that we can understand with our rational minds.     2.) That language is capable of (more or less) accurately depicting that real world..      3.) That language is a product of the individual writer's mind or free will, meaning that we determine what we say, and what we mean when we say it; that language thus expresses the essence of our individual beings (and that there is such a thing as an essential unique individual &quot;self&quot;).      4.) the SELF--also known as the &quot;subject,&quot; since that's how we represent the idea of a self in language, by saying I, which is the subject of a sentence--or the individual (or the mind or the free will) is the center of all meaning and truth; words mean what I say they mean, and truth is what I perceive as truth. I create my own sentences out of my own individual experiences and need for individual expression.     The STRUCTURALIST model argues   1.) that the structure of language itself produces &quot;reality&quot;--that we can think only through language, and therefore our perceptions of reality are all framed by and determined by the structure of language.     2.) That language speaks us; that the source of meaning is not an individual's experience or being, but the sets of oppositions and operations, the signs and grammars that govern language. Meaning doesn't come from individuals, but from the system that governs what any individual can do within it.      3.) Rather than seeing the individual as the center of meaning, structuralism places THE STRUCTURE at the center--it's the structure that originates or produces meaning, not the individual self. Language in particular is the center of self and meaning; I can only say &quot;I&quot; because I inhabit a system of language in which the position of subject is marked by the first personal pronoun, hence my identity is the product of the linguistic system I occupy.   \u00a0   This is also where deconstruction starts to come in. The leading figure in deconstruction, Jacques Derrida, looks at philosophy (Western metaphysics) to see that any system necessarily posits a CENTER, a point from which everything comes, and to which everything refers or returns. Sometimes it's God, sometimes it's the human self, the mind, sometimes it's the unconscious, depending on what philosophical system (or set of beliefs) one is talking about.     There are two key points to the idea of deconstruction. First is that we're still going to look at systems or structures, rather than at individual concrete practices, and that all systems or structures have a CENTER, the point of origin, the thing that created the system in the first place. Second is that all systems or structures are created of binary pairs or oppositions, of two terms placed in some sort of relation to each.      Derrida says that such systems are always built of the basic units structuralism analyzes--the binary opposition or pair--and that within these systems one part of that binary pair is always more important than the other, that one term is &quot;marked&quot; as positive and the other as negative. Hence in the binary pair good/evil, good is what Western philosophy values, and evil is subordinated to good. Derrida argues that all binary pairs work this way--light/dark, masculine/feminine, right/left; in Western culture, the first term is always valued over the second.      In his most famous work, Of Grammatology, Derrida looks particularly at the opposition speech/writing, saying that speech is always seen as more important than writing. This may not be as self-evident as the example of good/evil, but it's true in terms of linguistic theories, where speech is posited as the first or primary form of language, and writing is just the transcription of speech. Derrida says speech gets privileged because speech is associated with presence--for there to be spoken language, somebody has to be there to be speaking.      No, he doesn't take into account tape recordings and things like that. Remember, a lot of what these guys are talking about has roots in philosophic and linguistic traditions that predate modern technology--so that Derrida is responding to an opposition (speech/writing) that Plato set up, long before there were tape recorders. Just like poor old Levi-Strauss talks about how, in order to map all the dimensions of a myth, he'd have to have &quot;punch cards and an IBM machine,&quot; when all he'd need now is a home computer. Anyway, the idea is that the spoken word guarantees the existence of somebody doing the speaking--thus it reinforces all those great humanist ideas, like that there's a real self that is the origin of what's being said. Derrida calls this idea of the self that has to be there to speak part of the metaphysics of PRESENCE; the idea of being, or presence, is central to all systems of Western philosophy, from Plato through Descartes (up to Derrida himself). Presence is part of a binary opposition presence/absence, in which presence is always favored over absence. Speech gets associated with presence, and both are favored over writing and absence; this privileging of speech and presence is what Derrida calls LOGOCENTRISM. You might think here about the Biblical phrase &quot;Let there be light&quot; as an example. The statement insures that there is a God (the thing doing the speaking), and that God is present (because speech=presence); the present God is the origin of all things (because God creates the world by speaking), and what God creates is binary oppositions (starting with light/dark). You might also think about other binary oppositions or pairs, including being/nothingness, reason/madness, word/silence, culture/nature, mind/body. Each term has meaning only in reference to the other (light is what is not dark, and vice-versa), just as, in Saussure's view, signifiers only have meaning--or negative value--in relation to other signifiers. These binary pairs are the &quot;structures,&quot; or fundamental opposing ideas, that Derrida is concerned with in Western philosophy.   Because of the favoring of presence over absence, speech is favored over writing (and, as we'll see with Freud, masculine is favored over feminine because the penis is defined as a presence, whereas the female genitals are defined as absence). It's because of this favoring of presence over absence that every system posits a CENTER, a place from which the whole system comes, and which guarantees its meaning--this center guarantees being as presence. Think of your entire self as a kind of system--everything you do, think, feel, etc. is part of that system. At the core or center of your mental and physical life is a notion of SELF, of an &quot;I&quot;, of an identity that is stable and unified and coherent, the part of you that knows who you mean when you say &quot;I&quot;. This core self or &quot;I&quot; is thus the CENTER of the &quot;system&quot;, the &quot;langue&quot; of your being, and every other part of you (each individual act) is part of the &quot;parole&quot;. The &quot;I&quot; is the origin of all you say and do, and it guarantees the idea of your presence, your being. Western thought has a whole bunch of terms that serve as centers to systems --being, essence, substance, truth, form, consciousness, man, god, etc. What Derrida tells us is that each of these terms designating the center of a system serves two purposes: it's the thing that created the system, that originated it and guarantees that all the parts of the system interrelate, and it's also something beyond the system, not governed by the rules of the system. It is crucially important to note that LANGUAGE, as a system or structure, DOES NOT HAVE A CENTER. There is no central term or idea that creates language and that holds it all together. This is an extremely important idea, for Derrida and for poststructuralism. Without a center to hold the elements of the system in place, there is no absolute or definitive &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;meaning.&quot; Language is always shifting and moving, not fixed by a center-- hence meaning is ALWAYS ambiguous, multiple, and provisional. We will be talking about this idea throughout the rest of the semester. Derrida looks at how a binary opposition--the fundamental unit of the structures or systems we've been looking at, and of the philosophical systems he refers to--functions within a system. He points out that a binary opposition is algebraic (a=~b, a equals not-b), and that two terms can't exist without reference to the other--light (as presence) is defined as the absence of darkness, goodness the absence of evil, etc. He doesn't seek to reverse the hierarchies implied in binary pairs--to make evil favored over good, unconscious over consciousness, feminine over masculine. Rather, deconstruction wants to erase the boundaries (the slash) between oppositions, hence to show that the values and order implied by the opposition are also not rigid. Here's the basic method of deconstruction: find a binary opposition. Show how each term, rather than being polar opposite of its paired term, is actually part of it. Then the structure or opposition which kept them apart collapses, as we see with the terms nature and culture in Derrida's essay. Ultimately, you can't tell which is which, and the idea of binary opposites loses meaning, or is put into &quot;play&quot; (more on this in the next lecture). This method is called &quot;Deconstruction&quot; because it is a combination of construction/destruction--the idea is that you don't simply construct new system of binaries, with the previously subordinated term on top, nor do you destroy the old system--rather, you deconstruct the old system by showing how its basic units of structuration (binary pairs and the rules for their combination) contradict their own logic.\u00a0   In the seventies, Professor Keefer acted with a Structuralist Theater Company directed by Michael Kirby, her NYU Dissertation Advisor. He was color-blind, but interested in the patterns of black and white on the stage, so everyone wore black and white, opened and closed umbrellas, and spoke in foreign languages--French, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Japanese etc. From the Aristotelian point of view, the &quot;drama&quot; made no sense, but Kirby said it made sense structurally. In the middle I got to do wild dancing to the Stones for a brief cathartic relief, but then we went back to those patterns of coming and going in black and white. This Structuralism was influenced by Soviet theater and became an important part of the American experimental theater movement.               Feminist Criticism                      Feminist criticism is a type of literary criticism, which may study and advocate the rights of women. As Judith Fetterley says, &quot;Feminist criticism is a political act whose aim is not simply to interpret the world but to change it by changing the consciousness of those who read and their relation to what they read.&quot; Using feminist criticism to analyze fiction may involve studying the repression of women in fiction. How do men and women differ? What is different about female heroines, and why are these characters important in literary history? In addition to many of the questions raised by a study of women in literature, feminist criticism may study stereotypes, creativity, ideology, racial issues, marginality, and more.   Recently, feminist criticism has been criticized for perverting the classics by not appreciating their aesthetic values since they were written by the male, pale and stale. Censorship can occur from being too politically correct and not letting a work of art grow and breathe naturally.                   Marxist Criticism                      Karl Marx (1818-1883) was primarily a theorist and historian (less the evil pinko commie demon that McCarthyism fretted about). After examining social organization in a scientific way (thereby creating a methodology for social science: political science), he perceived human history to have consisted of a series of struggles between classes--between the oppressed and the oppressing. Whereas Freud saw &quot;sexual energy&quot; to be the motivating factor behind human endeavor and Nabokov seemed to feel artistic impulse was the real factor, Marx thought that &quot;historical materialism&quot; was the ultimate driving force, a notion involving the distribution of resources, gain, production, and such matters.    The supposedly &quot;natural&quot; political evolution involved (and would in the future involve) &quot;feudalism&quot; leading to &quot;bourgeois capitalism&quot; leading to &quot;socialism&quot; and finally to &quot;utopian communism.&quot; In bourgeois capitalism, the privileged bourgeoisie rely on the proletariat--the labor force responsible for survival. Marx theorized that when profits are not reinvested in the workers but in creating more factories, the workers will grow poorer and poorer until no short-term patching is possible or successful. At a crisis point, revolt will lead to a restructuring of the system.    For a political system to be considered communist, the underclasses must own the means of production--not the government nor the police force. Therefore, aside from certain first-century Christian communities and other temporary communes, communism has not yet really existed. (The Soviet Union was actually state-run capitalism.)    Marx is known also for saying that &quot;Religion is the opiate of the people,&quot; so he was somewhat aware of the problem that Lenin later dwelt on. Lenin was convinced that workers remain largely unaware of their own oppression since they are convinced by the state to be selfless. One might point to many &quot;opiates of the people&quot; under most political systems--diversions that prevent real consideration of trying to change unjust economic conditions.           Marxist Criticism              According to Marxists, and to other scholars in fact, literature reflects those social institutions out of which it emerges and is itself a social institution with a particular ideological function. Literature reflects class struggle and materialism: think how often the quest for wealth traditionally defines characters. So Marxists generally view literature &quot;not as works created in accordance with timeless artistic criteria, but as 'products' of the economic and ideological determinants specific to that era&quot; (Abrams 149). Literature reflects an author's own class or analysis of class relations, however piercing or shallow that analysis may be.    The Marxist critic simply is a careful reader or viewer who keeps in mind issues of power and money, and any of the following kinds of questions:       What role does class play in the work; what is the author's analysis of class relations?    How do characters overcome oppression?    In what ways does the work serve as propaganda for the status quo; or does it try to undermine it?    What does the work say about oppression; or are social conflicts ignored or blamed elsewhere?    Does the work propose some form of utopian vision as a solution to the problems encountered in the work?                      Eco-criticism                      Ecocritics investigate such things as the underlying ecological values, what is meant by the word nature, and whether the examination of &quot;place&quot; should be a distinctive category, much like class, gender or race. Ecocritics examine human perception of wilderness , and how it has changed throughout history and whether or not current environmental issues are accurately represented or even mentioned in popular culture and modern literature. Other disciplines, such as history, philosophy, ethics, and psychology, are also considered by ecocritics to be possible contributors to ecocriticism.    William Rueckert may have been the first person to use the term ecocriticism (Barry 240). In 1978, Rueckert published an essay titled Literature and Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism. His intent was to focus on \u201cthe application of ecology and ecological concepts to the study of literature.\u201d (Reprinted in The Ecocritism Reader on p.\u00a0107)    Ecologically minded individuals and scholars have been publishing progressive works of ecotheory and criticism since the explosion of environmentalism in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, because there was no organized movement to study the ecological/environmental side of literature, these important works were scattered and categorized under a litany of different subject headings: pastoralism, human ecology, regionalism, American Studies etc. British Marxist critic Raymond Williams , for example, wrote a seminal critique of pastoral literature in 1973, The Country and the City , which spawned two decades of leftist suspicion of the ideological evasions of the genre and its habit of making the work of rural labour disappear even though Williams himself observed that the losses lamented in pastoral might be genuine ones, and went on to profess a decidedly green socialism.    Another early ecocritical text, Joseph Meeker's The Comedy of Survival (1974), proposed a version of an argument that was later to dominate ecocriticism and environmental philosophy; that environmental crisis is caused primarily by a cultural tradition in the West of separation of culture from nature, and elevation of the former to moral predominance. Such 'anthropocentrism' is identified in the tragic conception of a hero whose moral struggles are more important than mere biological survival, whereas the science of animal ethology, Meeker asserts, shows that a &quot;comic mode&quot; of muddling through and &quot;making love not war&quot; has superior ecological value. In the later, &quot;second wave&quot; ecocriticism, Meeker's adoption of an ecophilosophical position with apparent scientific sanction as a measure of literary value tended to prevail over Williams's ideological and historical critique of the shifts in a literary genre's representation of nature.    As Glotfelty noted in The Ecocriticism Reader , \u201cOne indication of the disunity of the early efforts is that these critics rarely cited one another\u2019s work; they didn\u2019t know that it existed\u2026Each was a single voice howling in the wilderness.\u201d Nevertheless, ecocriticism\u2014unlike feminist and Marxist criticisms\u2014failed to crystallize into a coherent movement in the late 1970s, and indeed only did so in the USA in the 1990s.       In the mid 1980s, scholars began to work collectively to establish ecocritism as a genre, primarily through the work of the Western Literature Association in which the revaluation of nature writing as a non-fictional literary genre could function. In 1990, at the University of Nevada in Reno, Glotfelty became the first person to hold an academic position as a professor of Literature and the Environment, and UNR has retained the position it established at that time as the intellectual home of ecocriticism even as ASLE has burgeoned into an organization with thousands of members in the US alone. From the late 1990s, new branches of ASLE and affiliated organizations were started in the UK, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand (ASLEC-ANZ), India (OSLE-India}, Taiwan, Canada and Europe.   In comparison with other 'political' forms of criticism, there has been relatively little dispute about the moral and philosophical aims of ecocriticism, although its scope has broadened rapidly from nature writing, Romantic poetry canonical literature to take in film, TV, theatre, animal stories, architectures, scientific narratives and an extraordinary range of literary texts. At the same time, ecocriticism has borrowed methodologies and theoretically-informed approaches liberally from other fields of literary, social and scientific study.   Glotfelty's working definition in The Ecocriticism Reader is that &quot;ecocriticism is the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment&quot; (xviii), and one of the implicit goals of the approach is to recoup professional dignity for what Glotfelty calls the &quot;undervalued genre of nature writing&quot; (xxxi). Lawrence Buell defines \u201c\u2018ecocriticism\u2019 . . . as [a] study of the relationship between literature and the environment conducted in a spirit of commitment to environmentalist praxis\u201d (430, n.20).   Simon Estok noted in 2001 that \u201cecocriticism has distinguished itself, debates notwithstanding, firstly by the ethical stand it takes, its commitment to the natural world as an important thing rather than simply as an object of thematic study, and, secondly, by its commitment to making connections\u201d (\u201cA Report Card on Ecocriticism\u201d 220).   More recently, in an article that extends ecocriticism to Shakespearean studies, Estok argues that ecocriticism is more than \u201csimply the study of Nature or natural things in literature; rather, it is any theory that is committed to effecting change by analyzing the function\u2013thematic, artistic, social, historical, ideological, theoretical, or otherwise\u2013of the natural environment, or aspects of it, represented in documents (literary or other) that contribute to material practices in material worlds\u201d (\u201cShakespeare and Ecocriticism\u201d 16-17). This echoes the functional approach of the cultural ecology branch of ecocriticism, which analyzes the analogies between ecosystems and imaginative texts and posits that such texts potentially have an ecological (regenerative, revitalizing) function in the cultural system (Zapf, &quot;Literary Ecology&quot;).   As Michael P. Cohen has observed, \u201cif you want to be an ecocritic, be prepared to explain what you do and be criticized, if not satirized.\u201d Certainly, Cohen adds his voice to such critique, noting that one of the problems of ecocriticism has been what he calls its \u201cpraise-song school\u201d of criticism. All ecocritics share an environmentalist motivation of some sort, but whereas the majority are 'nature endorsing' (as Kate Soper puts it in &quot;What is Nature?&quot; (1998)), some are 'nature sceptical'. In part this entails a shared sense of the ways in which 'nature' has been used to legitimise gender, sexual and racial norms (so homosexuality has been seen as 'unnatural', for example), but it also involves scepticism about the uses to which 'ecological' language is put in ecocriticism; it can also involve a critique of the ways cultural norms of nature and the environment contribute to environmental degradation. Greg Garrard has dubbed 'pastoral ecology' the notion that nature undisturbed is balanced and harmonious (&quot;Ecocriticism&quot; 56-58), while Dana Phillips has criticised the literary quality and scientific accuracy of nature writing in &quot;The Truth of Ecology&quot;. Similarly, there has been a call to recognize the place of the Environmental Justice movement in redefining ecocritical discourse (see Buell, &quot;Toxic Discourse&quot;).     In response to the question of what ecocriticism is or should be, Camilo Gomides has offered an operational definition that is both broad and discriminating: &quot;The field of enquiry that analyzes and promotes works of art which raise moral questions about human interactions with nature, while also motivating audiences to live within a limit that will be binding over generations&quot; (16). He tests it for a film (mal)adaptation about Amazonian deforestation. Implementing the Gomides definition, Joseph Henry Vogel makes the case that ecocriticism constitutes an &quot;economic school of thought&quot; as it engages audiences to debate issues of resource allocation that have no technical solution.   \u00a0   Those of you interested in eco-criticism should go to the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment www.asle.org to get the latest in this area. I followed this track at the recent MLA 2012 convention in Seattle and it is the most important criticism of the twenty-first century because of climate change, globalism, and ecological disaster.   \u00a0         Existentialism, as a philosophical movement beginning with Kierkegaard, Heidigger, Nietzsche, Marcel, Buber et al, reached its literary climax in the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980)\u00a0and Albert Camus (1913-1960).   \u00a0   Sartre wrote drama, fiction, and expository essays in a clear, didactic style that popularized axims like &quot;I am therefore I think&quot; as opposed to the Cartesian &quot;I think therefore I am,&quot; or &quot;Man is the sum of his actions,&quot; or &quot;Hell is other People,&quot; stressing the subjective experiences of the individual human being as opposed to the ideologies and systems we find in our fascist cluster. While some of the philosophers and writers were Christian or believe in God, many were atheist and agnostic, and all of them stresses the responsibility and freedom of the individual against the will or fate of an outside or super power. In part, this was a backlash to the totalitarianism of the twentieth century and the Papal power of Christianity. He turned down the Nobel Prize in 1964 as he was very radical and leftist even though he came from a bourgeois background.   \u00a0   Sartre is a phenomenal dramatist and one of my favorite works is his play, &quot;No Exit,&quot; which I have produced many times. A deserter, a baby-killer, and a lesbian are locked inside a room for eternity, their &quot;hell.&quot; Although they keep looking for the fire and brimstone of Dante's Inferno, they soon realize that &quot;hell is other people,&quot; and that their conflicting objectives and personal limitations will torment each other for eternity. If you want to study characterization and scene study, this one-act play is the best I can recommend for conflicting objectives in a short time and space without resorting to real violence--just a paper knife.   \u00a0   Sartre's book, What is Literature will help you explore the didactic aspect of his mission, not unlike El Saadawi or others on our list. I don't agree with everything he writes, but this simple, clear book can help you frame questions for your cross-cultural essay and/or your Forum essay. If you get ambitious, then read Nausea, Existentialism is a Humanism, and Being and Nothingness.   \u00a0   Albert Camus accepted his Nobel Prize in 1957 as the first African-born writer, three years before he was killed in a car accident. Although he was born in Algeria, he moved to France and was a French citizen and activist in communist causes before they turned totalitarian. \u00a0He was also a great football player.   \u00a0   His best play is Caligula, but you may be more familiar with his novels like The Stranger and The Plague .   \u00a0   He is also a thoughtful and talented essayist. Read the Myth of Sisyphus http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html and The Rains of New York http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/twenty/nyc.html on Professor Keefer's sites.        When I did my Masters in French Literature at the Sorbonne in the twentieth century, I wrote my thesis on the Theater of the Absurd and how it rebelled against the constraints of classical theater with physical minimalism and intellectual complexity. At the same time that I was going to the theater in Paris every week, I was also taking acting classes and performing to see the differences between the old and the new.       Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco (1909 \u2013 28 March 1994) was a Romanian and French playwright and dramatist, and one of the foremost playwrights of the Theater of the Absurd. Beyond ridiculing the most banal situations, Ionesco's plays depict in a tangible way the solitude and insignificance of human existence.    Collections of The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, and The Chairs (1950-1951) are excellent introductions to the Theater of the Absurd. As a dramatist, Ionesco is\u00a0superb. Don't be deceived by his simplicity as his work is deep, not dumbed-down, and he plays terrific language games in The Lesson.\u00a0He admired Dadaists and Surrealists more than\u00a0Marxists. \u00a0    \u00a0    We produced Le Roi Se Meurt or Exit the King (1962) \u00a0and as a young girl of nineteen, it changed my way of thinking. As the king dies, he learns to savor each second of his dying day. As I sat drinking cafe au lait in the literary cafes of the Quartier Latin, I learned the true meaning of existentialism--to milk each moment for its unique existence, but\u00a0I, like Sartre and even Saadawi, prefer the responsibility\u00a0to other as opposed to wrestling too\u00a0much with the absurdity of existence.    Genet    Samuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 \u2013 22 December 1989) was an Irish writer, dramatist, and poet, writing in English and French. Beckett's work offers a bleak outlook on human culture and both formally and philosophically became increasingly\u00a0minimalist in his later career.    As a student, assistant, and friend of\u00a0James Joyce,\u00a0Beckett is considered one of the last modernists; as an inspiration to many later writers, he is sometimes considered one of the first postmodernists. He is also considered one of the key writers in what Martin Esslin\u00a0called Theater of the Absurd. As such, he is widely regarded as among the most influential writers of the 20th century.Beckett was awarded the 1969\u00a0Nobel Prize in Literature\u00a0&quot;for his writing, which\u2014in new forms for the novel and drama\u2014in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation.&quot;       Most of you may have seen Waiting for Godot (1953) or even Endgame (1957) and Krapp's Last Tape (1958) but he was also a significant literary critic, author of prose and poetry, and writer of the new media of radio and television.          Jean Genet (1910-1986)) was a prominent and controversial French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist.\u00a0Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but later took to writing. His major works include the novels\u00a0 The Thief's Journal and Our Lady of the Flowers\u00a0and the plays The Balcony, The Blacks, The Maids, and The Screens. Unlike some of the writers with bourgeois backgrounds, Genet's mother was a prostitute who put him up for adoption. He spent his life in and out of prison and was persecuted for his homosexuality. But his writing saved him as he created a unique literary legacy.    \u00a0       Edward Albee, the American playwright, is also occasionally considered part of this movement.          Act out these plays with friends and family to savor the Theater of the Absurd. You need minimal costumes and sets as these plays are designed to appeal to the intellect and make you question the absurdity of our existence.                      German Existentialism                                  Franz Kafka (1883-1924) Although Kafka finished his novella The Metamorphosis, he requested that all his other works be burned when he died. Isn't this the epitome of self-censorship, or did he succumb to the angst that is implicit and explicit in his works? Now his legacy includes a vast assortment of novels, stories, and essays. I recommend the Metamorphosis, The Trial, and The Penal Colony. See how you feel at the end of these works and compare that to how you feel at the end of a typical American transformative drama with a happy ending. No wonder we now have the adjective &quot;kafkaesque&quot; to describe this feeling. Also contrast this literature with your Wiki research on Hitler's Germany and the propaganda literature on the Fascist states that make people feel all is right in the rosy world ruled by the dictator. Does introspection and exploration of self always lead to angst?     \u00a0     Thomas Mann, (1875-1955) This ambitious writer won the Nobel Prize in     I recommend the novella Death in Venice (1912) and The Magic Mountain (1924). Not only is he wonderful at painting his world and getting inside his characters' heads, but he also reaches into contemporary themes of literature and medicine, tourism, and the global world. His work is rich and deep enough to span all movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.     \u00a0     How do these German existentialists compare to the French? Is there any analogy in music and art?                              Contemporary European Writers                                              Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl\u00e9zio (born 13 April 1940), usually identified as J. M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio , is a French author and professor. The author of over forty works, he was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature as an &quot;author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization.&quot;       \u00a0       As he writes about his wide travels and hybrid cultures, he embraces post-colonial and ecoliterary themes in a lucid, precise, poetic\u00a0style that is still more accessible than the modernists. I recommend The Desert, The Interrogation, Wandering Star, and Spring and Other Seasons.       \u00a0       He also writes books for children and travel essays.       \u00a0                                        \u00a0        Post 9/11 criticism is a burgeoning field in the twenty-first century, marked by the study of literature and terrorism, American exceptionalism, torture, censorship, global conflicts and disparities, and depiction of the other. Although it can include some discussion of the environment, it is more of an offshoot of Marxism than eco-poetics and tends to look at nature in terms of petromodernity, the\u00a0power and politics\u00a0of the fossil fuels. In books like The Kindly Ones, the German Mujahid, and The Patience Stone, there is also an imaginative depiction of the other, the role-playing and assumption of a narrative voice at odds with the author's own persona. For example, an Afghan male takes on the voice of a repressed Taliban female, an Algerian army officer makes the controversial analogy between the Islamists and the Nazis as he assumes the voice of two brothers investigating the shady, secret past of their Nazi father turned Mujahid and killed by the Islamists, and a New York Jew writes in French in the voice of an SS officer during the holocaust.    \u00a0    This area is best explored in Professor Keefer's Major New York authors course as well as her Journal on Terrorism or Unclashing Civilizations but it's good to have an overview of it in our global literature course.                                      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}]},

The protagonist and antagonists fight each other with such intensity that the audience experiences a catharsis, or purging of their emotions. In the twentieth and twenty-first century, terrorist attacks have occurred all over the world. No matter how extensive the strike is, the objective is to instill fear in the general public. So when we create literature about terrorist events, do we minimaze or exaggerate the actual events?      Much of twentieth century literature was influenced by Freud, Jung and other psychoanalytic schools. The dreams and unconscious motivations of characters are often more important than their conscious thoughts and actions.      The terrorist novel goes back to the Gothic novels of the late eighteenth century and the Victorian novels about the anarchist movement and the Russian novels by writers like Dostoyevsky as well as Conrad's early work.      Margaret Scanlan wrote a book about plotting terror and it's true that many of these novels are heavily plotted, just like terrorist attacks.      Professor Keefer presented a paper based Part II, Unclashing Civilizations, of her fantasy trilogy, published in 2006 at the Literature and Terrorism conference in London. After the \"cultural caesura\" of 9/11, the world is returning again to the fictional reconstruction of the kind of terrorist attacks that have been occurring all over the world, mainly inspired by extremist Islamist ideologies that distort the traditional concept of jihad for their own aims which do include undermining the hegemony and power of the U.S. and Europe.                      Catharsis                              In an age of terror, how does literature help us transcend our reality, lend perspective to our confusion by pulling us into the past and other cultures, and give expression to our anguish and fear through catharsis? They survived it; so can we. In this course we will define terrorism the way the Arabs define it, as any organized violence, by an individual, group or state, legitimate or illegitimate, against a civilian population, either intentional or unintentional. Because this is about twentieth and twenty first century literature, we will include the two World Wars with All Quiet on the Western Front, Night , No Exit, The Plague (about Algerian terror) as well as the German occupation and natural scourges, to Islamist militant terrorism in Egypt in The Day The Leader Was Killed, Satanic Verses, God Dies by the Nile and War in the Land of Egypt, t o Israeli/Palestinian terror in Martyr's Crossing and Wild Thorns, to the terror of hostage-taking and kidnapping in Mao II, News of a Kidnapping, and The Hostage, to the terror of totalitarian regimes such as China in Red Azalea and Soul Mountain. Black Water is both a personal and stylistic meditation on terror as well as an indirect indictment of the terror a powerful political leader has over an innocent civilian. Because one objective of fiction/drama is to create a combustive drama for the reader's catharsis, literature and terrorism are really competing with each other. Sometimes real life provides so much terror that the reader hides in literature for escape, seeking fantasy, happy endings, funny, harmless stories that eschew the turmoil of an unlivable situation. Often cultures will move through a transformation like New York did after 9/11, moving from the transformation of reality into tragedy with heroic stories, to silly, innocuous escapes, to some social comedy, and finally to stories that deal with fictional terror. No one can take too much of one thing. When New Yorkers were coughing from the smoke and toxins downtown, they did not go to the movies to see sci fi representations of Manhattan blowing up. Enough is enough.         What books give you a catharsis? What books make you want to throw up? What books don't move you at all?                           Literary Representations of Terror                                          But literature is different from film because we can choose when and how often to put the book down. Instead of watching a naturalistic representation, we recreate the story in our minds to excite, soothe or incite us. Many of the writers we will study had personal experience of a world war, the holocaust, the Israeli checkpoints, prison for their writings or gender brutality such as clitorectomies. Some could not write for years afterwards; others wrote on toilet paper in prison. It is significant that terrorism demands a certain amount of intelligence in order to achieve its devastating effect. Formalist agenda about character, plot, style/language, theme, setting/geography, descriptive techniques and narrative point of view must be supplemented and developed to deal with how \"literature engages with contemporary critical understandings of nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, global multiculturalism...\" I would add cyberspace to the list. I also believe that it is stultifying to repress critical reflection on difference to be politically correct. Not only does it make us oblivious to the richness of difference, but we also lose our sense of humor.            Note how spare the language is in Night, Holocaust Survival and Hiroshima mon Amour . In my book, I wanted distressed students to think and laugh and so I exaggerated, twisted, fantasized in an effort to have the reader transcend the horrible reality of 9/11.            What are the degrees of removal from the documentary event? What is the difference between naturalism and realism, fantasy and sci fi, romantic or surreal interpretations? What increases or mitgates the actual terror for you? In my book I wrote a poem about degrees of separation from 9/11, narrated by Shoes, Watch, and Statue of Liberty.                                                                         Psychoanalytic Criticism                                              Psychoanalytic criticism adopts the methods of \"reading\" employed by Freud and later theorists to interpret texts. It argues that literary texts, like dreams, express the secret unconscious desires and anxieties of the author, that a literary work is a manifestation of the author's own neuroses. One may psychoanalyze a particular character within a literary work, but it is usually assumed that all such characters are projections of the author's psyche.       One interesting facet of this approach is that it validates the importance of literature, as it is built on a literary key for the decoding. Freud himself wrote, \"The dream-thoughts which we first come across as we proceed with our analysis often strike us by the unusual form in which they are expressed; they are not clothed in the prosaic language usually employed by our thoughts, but are on the contrary represented symbolically by means of similes and metaphors, in images resembling those of poetic speech\".             Like psychoanalysis itself, this critical endeavor seeks evidence of unresolved emotions, psychological conflicts, guilts, ambivalences, and so forth within what may well be a disunified literary work. The author's own childhood traumas, family life, sexual conflicts, fixations, and such will be traceable within the behavior of the characters in the literary work. But psychological material will be expressed indirectly, disguised, or encoded (as in dreams) through principles such as \"symbolism\" (the repressed object represented in disguise), \"condensation\" (several thoughts or persons represented in a single image), and \"displacement\" (anxiety located onto another image by means of association).             Despite the importance of the author here, psychoanalytic criticism is similar to New Criticism in not concerning itself with \"what the author intended.\" But what the author never intended (that is, repressed) is sought. The unconscious material has been distorted by the censoring conscious mind.             How can you analyze your passage from this point of view?                                     Us versus Them: The Political Implications of Terrorism                                                          After 9/11, President Bush stomped through Near and Central Asia shouting out his war decree of \"us versus them,\" a disjunctive syllogism that wanted the world to choose between the \"legitimate\" power of the American war machine, capable of a nuclear holocaust, and the \"illegitimate power\" of disparate bands of dedicated Islamist \"terrorists,\" armed with box-cutters, knives, and homemade suicide bombs. Since death is death no matter who inflicts it, why are the Al Qaeda operatives branded as terrorists but the American government isn't? If they could establish world dominion, would \"we\" be branded as terrorists?                Since all war inevitably kills the innocent, what makes terrorist events worse? Is it like the Indians hiding in the bushes while the British colonialists marched forthrightly to battle with their guns and flags? If terrorism is about a \"surprise\" attack, then what about the surprise the Japanese felt when the nuclear bomb decimated Hiroshima and their lives for years afterwards?                If terrorism is a deus ex machina for the victims, what does this do to dramatic structure?                If we continue the \"us versus them\" way of thinking, then how can American novelists like Don DeLillo, Andre Dubus III, and John Updike enter the minds of their Islamist characters? Do they succeed and if not, why not? To enter the mind of my antagonist, Jalal Khalifeh, I became friends with a local Egyptian who used to be in the Muslim brotherhood, and then I traveled all over Egypt, Morocco, and Turkey hanging out with locals, going to mosques, and yes, finding Al Qaeda sympathizers. I learned a lot about the good and bad interpretations of Islam and the lifestyle of devout Muslim men in their twenties but I didn't meet a senior-level Al Qaeda terrorist until I met Ibrahim al-Harbi in my father's nursing home in Ottawa who was a well-respected physician and talented poet. When we went out to dinner, he divulged his radical views, and when I invited him to NYC he implied he was on the watch list. A year later he was apprehended in Syria on his way to Iraq and deported to a Saudi Arabian prison. His limp was from the first Afghan war when he was a teenager. Then he became one of the senior operatives and was planning big things from his oasis in Canada when he was caught. This guy was one of the most brilliant people I have ever met anywhere so although terrorists may use poor people, I am not sure the 21st century terrorism is fueled by that. He hated thepolitical, economic, military, and cultural hegemony of the U.S., what Israel did and does to Palestine, and what European colonialists did to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. He was fighting his own \"us versus them,\" and he was prepared to die for his beliefs like all the other Islamists. It took a lot of courage for me to get inside his head but unfortunately I met him after my book was published! Certainly DeLillo, Updike, and Dubus didn't go through what I went through but they are excellent writers who depict the victims' point of view with sensitivity and perception.                        How do the real-world political conflicts affect the seesaw of dramatic structure in the books you are using? Can an author create the total humanity of a 9/11 hijacker? Are 9/11 novels wrapped in a cocoon of narcissism?         It took great courage to write against the fascist governments of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and Communist China. Based on utopias, deluded thinking, and/or distorted applications of Marxist thinking, these totalitarian governments ironically inspired creativity from their constraints, at least in the beginning. Once those writers were censored, imprisoned, and/or exiled, the dry periods began. But each country is different. While Mao's China fostered a kind of women's liberation with the appointment of female military officers, the librettos of the Peking Revolutionary Opera that turned women into heroes, protection against sexual harassment, and equal rights, the Soviet Union maintained women in subservient roles, and there appears to be an absence or idealization of women in much holocaust literature. Nazi Germany spent a lot of time burning books, and people, and Hitler was a frustrated artist who turned his insanity into genocide, but the Soviet Union had its own kind of realist art and film, and Mao and his wife created beautiful, colorful revolutionary operas, combining ballet, acrobatics, classical opera music, and women's liberation with Marxist plots. Because my father and brother spent a lot of time in Mao's China, I have original versions of most of these operas. Even Anchee Min loved them--at first.                 In order to provoke deeper thinking and help you contribute to your Wikis, imagine that you not free-thinking Westerners but members of these communities, trying to see the appeal of their rhetoric at first. In this Rogerian way of understanding oppositional counterclaims, we can better analyze how and why these fascist governments were successful.                 Fascism also occurs all over Latin America and in many countries in Africa and Asia. But as I said before, we have courses devoted exclusively to Latin American and African literature, so I focus on the major writers of North America, the U.K., the Maghreb and Middle East, China, India, Russia, and Europe. To really understand the literary movements of each of these places, you would need to concentrate on minor and major writers, history, and literary theory.                          Just as it is important to know Chairman Mao's Peking Revolutionary Opera to understand what writers like Gao Xingjian, Anchee Min and Dai Sijie were up against, it is also critical to examine Stalin's program of socialist realism.          The theory    of Socialist Realism was adopted by the Congress of Soviet Writers    in 1934. Approved by Joseph Stalin , Nickolai    Bukharin , Maxim Gorky and Andrey    Zhdanov , Socialist Realism demanded that all art must depict some    aspect of man's struggle toward socialist progress for a better life.    It stressed the need for the creative artist to serve the proletariat    by being realistic, optimistic and heroic. The doctrine considered    all forms of experimentalism as degenerate and pessimistic. The writings of Tolstoi and Dostoyevsky, that depicted the despair in all of us, were banned. Throughout history, we see that when new leaders create new governments, especially through revolution, they seek to control the intellectual and artistic as well as the socio-economic lives of their people. If they fail to do this, the revolution might not succeed.                   Experimental    and non-conformist writers such as Yevgeni    Zamyatin , Isaac Babel , Boris    Pilnyak , Nickolai Tikhonov , Mikhail    Slonimski , Vsevolod Ivanov , Victor    Serge , Vladimir Mayakovsky , Sergei    Yesenin , Konstantin Fedin , Victor    Shklovsky , Mikhail Zoshchenko and Alexander Solzhenitsyn suffered    under this policy. Zamyatin and Serge managed to leave the country,    whereas Mayakovsky and Yesenin committed suicide. Writers who refused    to change, such as Babel and Pilnyak, were executed or died in labour    camps.                   Compare and Contrast our 4 Writers:                    Even though most of you will be reading in translation, note the different styles of these four writers. Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn won the Nobel Prize. While Pasternak's style is more poetic, in fact he was a poet, Solzhenitsyn thrives on a naturalistic style that gives a documentary feel to his horrors. If possible, read the 2010 translation of Dr. Zhivago by award-winning translators Richard Pevea r and Larissa Volokhonsky , noted for their versions of War and Peace and Anna Karenina. I met them at the 92nd St Y and was very impressed with their work. Dr, Zhivago was first published in 1957 in Italy and was banned in the soviet Union until 1988. The 1958 english edition of Zhivago was hastily produced for Pasternak's upcoming Nobel Peace Prize, which he declined due to extreme pressure form the Soviet government. Reviewers have said that the new version shows more of the nuances of the original Russian text and will reveal a better understanding of Pasternak's style and the Soviet Union during the 20th century.Ayn Rand and Bulgakov have opposite styles: contrast her straightforward, minimal style, which she ironically censored in Anthem to conform to American mass market taste, with the magical realism of Bulgakov's Master and Margarita, a wild ride that influenced Rushdie's Satanic Verses.                    Boris Leonidovich Pasternak (1890-1960), born in Moscow, was the son of talented artists: his father a painter and illustrator of Tolstoy's works, his mother a well-known concert pianist. Pasternak's education began in a German Gymnasium in Moscow and was continued at the University of Moscow. Under the influence of the composer Scriabin, Pasternak took up the study of musical composition for six years from 1904 to 1910. By 1912 he had renounced music as his calling in life and went to the University of Marburg, Germany, to study philosophy. After four months there and a trip to Italy, he returned to Russia and decided to dedicate himself to literature.                   Pasternak's first books of verse went unnoticed. With Sestra moya zhizn (My Sister Life), 1922, and Temy i variatsii (Themes and Variations), 1923, the latter marked by an extreme, though sober style, Pasternak first gained a place as a leading poet among his Russian contemporaries. In 1924 he published Vysokaya bolezn (Sublime Malady), which portrayed the 1905 revolt as he saw it, and Detstvo Lyuvers (The Childhood of Luvers), a lyrical and psychological depiction of a young girl on the threshold of womanhood. A collection of four short stories was published the following year under the title Vozdushnye puti (Aerial Ways). In 1927 Pasternak again returned to the revolution of 1905 as a subject for two long works: Leytenant Shmidt , a poem expressing threnodic sorrow for the fate of Lieutenant Schmidt, the leader of the mutiny at Sevastopol, and Devyatsot pyaty god (The Year 1905), a powerful but diffuse poem which concentrates on the events related to the revolution of 1905. Pasternak's reticent autobiography, Okhrannaya gramota (Safe Conduct), appeared in 1931, and was followed the next year by a collection of lyrics, Vtoroye rozhdenie (Second Birth), 1932. In 1935 he published translations of some Georgian poets and subsequently translated the major dramas of Shakespeare, several of the works of Goethe, Schiller, Kleist, and Ben Jonson, and poems by Pet&ouml;fi, Verlaine, Swinburne, Shelley, and others. Na rannikh poyezdakh (In Early Trains), a collection of poems written since 1936, was published in 1943 and enlarged and reissued in 1945 as Zemnye prostory (Wide Spaces of the Earth). In 1957 Doktor Zhivago , Pasternak's only novel - except for the earlier \"novel in verse\", Spektorsky (1926) - first appeared in an Italian translation and has been acclaimed by some critics as a successful attempt at combining lyrical-descriptive and epic-dramatic styles. An autobiographical sketch, Biografichesky ocherk (An Essay in Autobiography), was published in 1959, first in Italian, and subsequently in English. Pasternak lived in Peredelkino, near Moscow, until his death in 1960.                         Boris Pasternak died on May 30, 1960.                    Although it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, Doctor Zhivago was not completed until 1956. The novel was submitted to the journal \"&#1053;&#1086;&#1074;&#1099;&#1081; &#1052;&#1080;&#1088;\" (Novy Mir, Russian for both New World and New Peace ) and rejected because Pasternak's political viewpoint was opposed by the Soviet authorities. [2] The author, like Zhivago, showed more concern with the welfare of individuals than with the welfare of society. Soviet censors construed some passages as anti- Marxist . There are implied criticisms of Stalinism and references to prison camps. In 1957, the Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli smuggled the book manuscript out of the Soviet Union thanks to Isaiah Berlin and simultaneously published editions in both Russian and Italian in Milan , Italy. It was published in English (translated from Russian by Manya Harari and Max Hayward ) the next year and was eventually published in a total of eighteen different languages. The publication of this novel was partly responsible for Pasternak's being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. The Soviet government asked the committee not to award him the prize. Pasternak was pressured by Soviet authorities to reject the Nobel Prize in order to prevent a scandal in the Soviet Union [3] . Pasternak died on 30 May 1960, of natural causes.           Doctor Zhivago was finally published in the Soviet Union in 1988, in the pages of Novy mir , although earlier samizdat editions existed.          Yuri Zhivago is sensitive and poetic nearly to the point of mysticism . Zhivago's idealism and principles stand in contrast to the brutality and horror of World War I , the Russian Revolution , and the subsequent Russian Civil War . A major theme of the novel is how mysticism and idealism are destroyed by both the Bolsheviks and the White Army alike, as both sides commit horrible atrocities. Yuri witnesses dismemberment and other horrors suffered by the innocent civilian population during the turmoil. Even the love of his life, Lara, is taken from him.          Zhivago ponders how war can turn the whole world senseless, and make an otherwise reasonable group of people destroy each other with no regard for life. His journey through Russia has an epic, dreamlike, almost surreal feeling. He travels through a world which is in such striking contrast to himself, relatively uncorrupted by violence. His desire to find a place away from it all drives him across the Arctic Siberia of Russia, and eventually back to Moscow. Pasternak subtly criticizes of Soviet ideology: he disagrees with the idea of \"building a new man,\" which, he suggests, is against nature.          His great love's life is also dealt with in considerable detail. Lara, whose full name is Larissa Feodorovna Guishar (later Antipova), born into the bourgeoisie, is engaged to Pavel \"Pasha\" Antipov, an idealistic young student who becomes involved in Bolshevism through his father. Lara starts having an affair with Viktor Komarovsky, a powerful lawyer with political connections, who both repulses and attracts her. To gain independence from Komarovsky, Lara spends three years working as a live-in nanny for a wealthy family (the Kologrivovs). Upon returning, Lara's brother begs her to get 700 rubles from Komarovsky to repay money that he has gambled away. Lara gets the money from her generous employer, Kologrivov. However, when her pupil Lipa graduates, she feels like she is on charity instead of working for her keep in the Kologrivov household. She decides that Komarovsky \"owes her.\" She attends a party to demand the money from Komarovsky. But he spends the evening playing cards and pays her no attention. She finally walks in and attempts to shoot him but misses. [4]          Lara and Zhivago have a number of brief encounters before truly meeting. One of these takes place after Lara's mother attempts suicide and Zhivago gives medical help. Zhivago also sees Lara at the Christmas party where she tries to shoot Komarovsky. Lara and Zhivago have their first real conversation after a roadside encounter between First World War troop columns: a miserable troop of retreating Russian Army deserters and new recruits bound for the hopeless conditions at the Front. Lara has been serving as nurse while searching for her assumed-dead husband Antipov. Lara and Zhivago serve together in a makeshift field hospital and fall in love. They do not consummate their relationship until much later, meeting in the town of Yuriatin after the war.          Pasha Antipov and Komarovsky continue to play important roles in the story. Pasha is assumed killed in World War I, but is actually captured by the Germans and escapes. Pasha Antipov joins the Bolsheviks and becomes Strelnikov (the shooter), a fearsome Red Army general who becomes infamous for executing White prisoners (hence his nickname). However, he is never a true Bolshevik and yearns for the fighting to be over so he can return to Lara. (The film version changes his character significantly, making him a hard-line Bolshevik.)          Another major character is Liberius, commander of the \"Forest Brotherhood\", the Red Partisan band which conscripts Yuri into service. Liberius is a dedicated and heroic revolutionary. But he is also a cocaine addict, loud-mouthed and vain, and bores Yuri with his constant lectures about the justice of their cause and the inevitability of their victory.          Komarovsky reappears towards the end of the story. He has gained some influence in the Bolshevik government and been appointed minister of justice of the Far Eastern Republic , a Bolshevik puppet state in Siberia. He offers Zhivago and Lara transit out of Russia. They initially refuse. But Komarovsky lies about Pasha Antipov's death and persuades Zhivago that it is in Lara's best interests to leave; Zhivago convinces Lara to go with Komarovsky, telling her (falsely) that he will follow her shortly.          Meanwhile, Antipov/Strelnikov falls from grace, loses his position in the Red Army, and returns to Varykino , near Yuriatin, where he hopes to find Lara. She, however, has just left with Komarovsky. After having a lengthy conversation with Zhivago, Pasha Antipov commits suicide and is found the next morning by Zhivago. (In the movie Komarovsky tells Zhivago that he was captured 5 miles outside of Yuriatin and on the way to his execution he grabbed a pistol from a guard and killed himself.)          Zhivago's life and health go downhill after this; he lives with another woman and has two children with her, plans numerous writing projects but does not finish them, and is increasingly absent-minded, erratic, and unwell. Lara eventually returns to Russia on the day of Zhivago's funeral. She gets Yevgraf, his half brother, to try to find her daughter but then disappears.          During World War II Zhivago's old friends Nika Dudorov and Misha Gordon meet up. One of their discussions revolves around a local laundress named Tanya, a bezprizornaya or parentless child, one of many left by the Civil War, and her resemblance to Zhivago. Much later they meet over the first edition of Zhivago's poems.          Other major characters include Tonya Gromeko, Zhivago's wife, and her parents Alexander and Anna, with whom Zhivago lived after he lost his parents as a child. Yevgraf (Evgraf) Zhivago, Yuri's younger illegitimate half-brother (son of his father and a Mongolian princess), is a mysterious figure who gains power and influence with the Bolsheviks and helps his brother evade arrest throughout the course of the story.          The book is packed full of odd coincidences; characters disappear and reappear seemingly at random, encountering each other in the most unlikely places.          The Russian Revolution was at its core an ideological struggle, forcing young and old alike to align themselves or risk extermination . Its uncompromising nature put great strain on the ideals of individual thought and choice, represented in Yuri Zhivago's constant attempts to come to terms with the Revolution. Yuri is the ultimate individual, expressing himself through poetry and recognizing beauty in all aspects of life. He is frequently overcome by emotion, and is deeply introspective . His affair with Lara was primarily fueled by passion and romanticism. However, he gradually realizes that his commitment to own unique philosophy is rapidly becoming untenable in the face of a crystallizing Soviet ideology. His attempts to exert control over his own individual self end in futility: in one pivotal scene, he wounds and possibly kills several White soldiers despite his best efforts avoid doing so. The taking of lives is a betrayal of his personal core beliefs, and Yuri is horrified and demoralized by the incident. Ultimately, the revolution's refusal to acknowledge the fundamental nature of the individual ensured that regardless of which faction Yuri sided with, he would not be able to survive in the new Soviet era as a true individual.          When he was younger, Zhivago enjoyed having political discussions with educated people, like his uncle Nicholai. Zhivago's views were relatively neutral&mdash;though not a revolutionary zealot , he recognized that Russia needed serious reform. As the story progresses, however, Zhivago realizes that many political activists simply parrot the ideas they have heard, reciting their memorized lines in order to seem intellectual. Still others actively seek power for themselves, taking advantage of the people's thirst for betterment by promising more than they intended to deliver. Pasternak shows what he thought went wrong in the revolution: that initially, revolutionary leaders had good ideas, but because of human failings these ideas were warped or even forgotten as the revolution progressed. Pasternak's strategy to convey this point is to introduce seemingly obvious villains into the plot, but show that in the context of the entire novel, the results of their bad behavior pales in comparison to the harm caused by the corrupted revolutionary effort. Komarovsky and Strelnikov are both antagonists in the sense that they cause harm to other characters in the book, but Pasternak cleverly uses them to show that their damage was temporary and relatively minor, whereas the trauma and suffering caused by the misled train wreck of the revolution was more permanent, often fatal, and certainly more devastating to Russian society.                    Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn          I was born at Kislovodsk on 11th December, 1918. My father had studied philological subjects at Moscow University, but did not complete his studies, as he enlisted as a volunteer when war broke out in 1914. He became an artillery officer on the German front, fought throughout the war and died in the summer of 1918, six months before I was born. I was brought up by my mother, who worked as a shorthand-typist, in the town of Rostov on the Don, where I spent the whole of my childhood and youth, leaving the grammar school there in 1936. Even as a child, without any prompting from others, I wanted to be a writer and, indeed, I turned out a good deal of the usual juvenilia. In the 1930s, I tried to get my writings published but I could not find anyone willing to accept my manuscripts. I wanted to acquire a literary education, but in Rostov such an education that would suit my wishes was not to be obtained. To move to Moscow was not possible, partly because my mother was alone and in poor health, and partly because of our modest circumstances. I therefore began to study at the Department of Mathematics at Rostov University, where it proved that I had considerable aptitude for mathematics. But although I found it easy to learn this subject, I did not feel that I wished to devote my whole life to it. Nevertheless, it was to play a beneficial role in my destiny later on, and on at least two occasions, it rescued me from death. For I would probably not have survived the eight years in camps if I had not, as a mathematician, been transferred to a so-called sharashia , where I spent four years; and later, during my exile, I was allowed to teach mathematics and physics, which helped to ease my existence and made it possible for me to write. If I had had a literary education it is quite likely that I should not have survived these ordeals but would instead have been subjected to even greater pressures. Later on, it is true, I began to get some literary education as well; this was from 1939 to 1941, during which time, along with university studies in physics and mathematics, I also studied by correspondence at the Institute of History, Philosophy and Literature in Moscow.                    In 1941, a few days before the outbreak of the war, I graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Rostov University. At the beginning of the war, owing to weak health, I was detailed to serve as a driver of horsedrawn vehicles during the winter of 1941-1942. Later, because of my mathematical knowledge, I was transferred to an artillery school, from which, after a crash course, I passed out in November 1942. Immediately after this I was put in command of an artillery-position-finding company, and in this capacity, served, without a break, right in the front line until I was arrested in February 1945. This happened in East Prussia, a region which is linked with my destiny in a remarkable way. As early as 1937, as a first-year student, I chose to write a descriptive essay on \"The Samsonov Disaster\" of 1914 in East Prussia and studied material on this; and in 1945 I myself went to this area (at the time of writing, autumn 1970, the book August 1914 has just been completed).                    I was arrested on the grounds of what the censorship had found during the years 1944-45 in my correspondence with a school friend, mainly because of certain disrespectful remarks about Stalin, although we referred to him in disguised terms. As a further basis for the \"charge\", there were used the drafts of stories and reflections which had been found in my map case. These, however, were not sufficient for a \"prosecution\", and in July 1945 I was \"sentenced\" in my absence, in accordance with a procedure then frequently applied, after a resolution by the OSO (the Special Committee of the NKVD), to eight years in a detention camp (at that time this was considered a mild sentence).                    I served the first part of my sentence in several correctional work camps of mixed types (this kind of camp is described in the play, The Tenderfoot and the Tramp ). In 1946, as a mathematician, I was transferred to the group of scientific research institutes of the MVD-MOB (Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of State Security). I spent the middle period of my sentence in such \"SPECIAL PRISONS\" ( The First Circle ). In 1950 I was sent to the newly established \"Special Camps\" which were intended only for political prisoners. In such a camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan ( One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich ), I worked as a miner, a bricklayer, and a foundryman. There I contracted a tumour which was operated on, but the condition was not cured (its character was not established until later on).                    One month after I had served the full term of my eight-year sentence, there came, without any new judgement and even without a \"resolution from the OSO\", an administrative decision to the effect that I was not to be released but EXILED FOR LIFE to Kok-Terek (southern Kazakhstan). This measure was not directed specially against me, but was a very usual procedure at that time. I served this exile from March 1953 (on March 5th, when Stalin's death was made public, I was allowed for the first time to go out without an escort) until June 1956. Here my cancer had developed rapidly, and at the end of 1953, I was very near death. I was unable to eat, I could not sleep and was severely affected by the poisons from the tumour. However, I was able to go to a cancer clinic at Tashkent, where, during 1954, I was cured ( The Cancer Ward, Right Hand ). During all the years of exile, I taught mathematics and physics in a primary school and during my hard and lonely existence I wrote prose in secret (in the camp I could only write down poetry from memory). I managed, however, to keep what I had written, and to take it with me to the European part of the country, where, in the same way, I continued, as far as the outer world was concerned, to occupy myself with teaching and, in secret, to devote myself to writing, at first in the Vladimir district ( Matryona's Farm ) and afterwards in Ryazan.                    During all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared that this would become known. Finally, at the age of 42, this secret authorship began to wear me down. The most difficult thing of all to bear was that I could not get my works judged by people with literary training. In 1961, after the 22nd Congress of the U.S.S.R. Communist Party and Tvardovsky's speech at this, I decided to emerge and to offer One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich .                    Such an emergence seemed, then, to me, and not without reason, to be very risky because it might lead to the loss of my manuscripts, and to my own destruction. But, on that occasion, things turned out successfully, and after protracted efforts, A.T. Tvardovsky was able to print my novel one year later. The printing of my work was, however, stopped almost immediately and the authorities stopped both my plays and (in 1964) the novel, The First Circle , which, in 1965, was seized together with my papers from the past years. During these months it seemed to me that I had committed an unpardonable mistake by revealing my work prematurely and that because of this I should not be able to carry it to a conclusion.                    It is almost always impossible to evaluate at the time events which you have already experienced, and to understand their meaning with the guidance of their effects. All the more unpredictable and surprising to us will be the course of future events.                                    Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940)                    Russian journalist, playwright, novelist, and short story writer, whose major work was the Gogolesque fantasy The Master and Margarita . In the story the Devil visits Stalinist Moscow to see if he can do some good. The book is considered a major Russian novel of the 20th century. It first appeared in a censored form in the Soviet journal Moskva in 1966-67. Bulgakov used satire and fantasy also in his other works, among them the short story collection Diaboliad (1925).           It was hard to say exactly what had made Bezdomny write as he had--whether it was his great talent for graphic description or complete ignorance of the subject he was writing on, but his Jesus had come out, well, completely alive, a Jesus who had really existed, although admittedly a Jesus who had every possible fault.\"            (from The Master and Margarita )           Mihail Bulgakov was born in Kiev, Ukraine, the eldest son of a theology professor at the Kiev Theological Academy. After attending First Kiev High School (1900-09), Bulgakov studied medicine at the Kiev University (1909-16). From 1916 to 1918 he served as a doctor in front-line and district hospitals. These experiences he described in notes of a young doctor, 'Zapiski yunogo vracha' (1925-26).           In 1918-19 Bulgakov worked as a doctor in Kiev, and witnessed the German occupation and then the occupation by the Red Army. During these war years he used a morphine, but with the helped of his first wife he managed to win the addiction. In 1920 Bulgakov abandoned medicine in favor of a career as a writer. He organized in Vladikavkaz, Caucasus, a 'sub-department of the arts', wrote stories for newspapers           Bulgakov moved in 1921 to Moskow, where he worked for the literary department of the People's Commissariat of Education, and wrote as a journalist for various groups and papers. His largely autobiographical novel BELAYA GVARDIYA (1925, full text 1973, The White Guard) was an account of the turbulent years between 1914 and 1921 as reflected in the lives of a White family in the Ukraine. Two parts of the book was published in the journal Rossiya , which was closed before the third part could appear. Bulgakov abandoned his plans for a trilogy; the proofs of the new ending surfaced in 1987, but the final pages were missing.           From 1925 Bulgakov was associated with the Moscow Arts Theatre. He wrote and staged many plays, which enjoyed great popularity. Bulgakov's criticism of the Soviet system was not swallowed by the authorities. The Heart of the Dog (written in 1925), a satire on Soviet life in the guise of science fiction, was condemned unpublishable. In the story 'Pokhozhdenia Chichikova' the protaginist of Gogol's Dead Souls was dropped in the middle of the Soviet Russia's New Economic Policy period of 1921-27. 'Diaboliad' (1925) portrayed a poor clerk in a gigantic bureaucracy, where he loses his identity and life.           In 1928 Bulgakov had three plays running in three Moscow theatres, Zoya's Apartment , The Crimson Island , and The Days of the Turbins , dramatized from his novel The White Guard . It brought the author overnight success and became 'a new Seagull ' for the new generation, although it also received hostile reviews for the sympathetic portrayal of White officers. Paradoxically, The White Guard was one of Stalin's favorite plays. It was banned in 1929, reinstated in 1932 but not published until 1955.           By 1930s Bulgakov's works were published rarely or not at all - Zoya's Apartment (1926), a play set in an atelier-bordello, was banned, as The Crimson Island (1928). Flight (1928), dealing with White fugitives leaving Russia, was banned before its premiere. In 1929 he wrote to Maxim Gorky: \"All my plays have been banned; not a line of mine is being printed anywhere; I have no work ready, and not a kopeck of royalties is coming in from any source; not a single institution, not a single individual will reply to my applications...\"           After writing a letter to Soviet government, requesting permission to emigrate, Bulgakov received a personal telephone call from Stalin and was employed as an assistant producer with the Moscow Arts Theatre. He adapted classics for the stage. During the late 1930s he was librettist and consultant at Bolshoi Theatre. However, Stalin's favour protected Bulgakov only from arrests and executions, but his writings remained unpublished. In Black Snow, a Theatrical Novel , Bulgakov described his love-hate relationship and took a revenge on Stanislavsky for the failure of his play A Cabal of Hypocrites , produced under the title Moli&egrave;re . In one scene Louis XIV, the Sun King, says: \"Then hear this: my author is oppressed. He is frightened. I will show kindness to anyone who forewarns me of whatever danger imperils him... The ban is lifted. You may stage Tartuffe .\" The Last Days was performed first in 1943 under the title Pushkin . Bulgakov's stage version of Gogol's Dead Souls had a modest success.           Bulgakov's most important work was The Master and Margarita , a fantasy about the Devil, disguised as a professor, who causes havoc in the city. The work was suppressed because Bulgakov refused to make the changes reguired by the authorities. Although Bulgakov worked still on the text on his death bed, the novel was completed. The first Soviet edition was published in 1966-67, a fuller text appeared in 1973 and the revised full text in 1989.           The Master and Margarita (1928-40). Published in installments in 1966 and 1967 in the journal Moskva . The large novel takes place on three levels, each of which provides a commentary on the others. Historical narrative is set in Jerusalem, where Pontius Pilate condemns to death a man, Jeshua, whom he knows to be innocent. Contemporary narrative is set in Moscow, in the 1930s, where the Master and Margarita live and where the Master has written a novel about Pilate. The third, fantastic level introduces the devil, who steps out of Goethe's Faust. He appears in Moscow with a retinue that includes an enormous black cat. The devil, Woland, is unconventionally seen as a relatively sympathetic figure, Righteous Man in Sodom. Moreover, the character of Jesus, called Yeshua, in not very Biblical. The philosophical and religious themes and examination of the freedom of art circulate around the intrusion of the devil into the life of modern Moscow and the crucifixion of Christ. Interacting and competing discourses from the realms of science, religion, literature, history, and politics, complicate further the narrative. Master burns his manuscript and retires to a madhouse. Margarita's love for the master drives her to a pact with Satan. However, \"manuscripts don't burn\" and Woland defends the existence of Jeshua.            Bulgakov composed two versions of the work. One was written at home and another, when he did not have the original available, was born while he was living with a mistress. Much of the the satire is aimed at greed, vanity, and pettiness, but is possible to read the book as a tribute to Stalin's policy to cut the bourgeois elements of Soviet society. After the publication Bulgakov was seen as a link between such writers as Vasilii Aksenov, Andrei Siniavskii, and the Strugatskii brothers, and the great past tradition of Gogol and Dostoevskii.           Bulgakov was married three times: with Tatiana Nikolaevna Lappa (1913), Liubov Evgenevna Belozerskaia (1924), and Elena Sergeevna Shilovskaya (1932), who gave invaluable support to the author when he wrote The Master and Margarita and had his fits of paranoia. Bulgakov was writing Black Snow , his theatre novel, when he died in Moskow on March 10, 1940. It took until the 1980s before all Bulgakov's works could be printed in his own home country. For decades Bulgakov was considered an outsider and the most \"un-Soviet\" writer. Supernatural and occult attracted him, and he used sudden cuts into the fantastic and mockery. Although he was subjected to a number of restrictions as a writer, he survived attacks from the officials, when others were imprisoned and perished in the 'Gulag Archipelago'.                   Ayn Rand                    Ayn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. At age six she taught herself to read and two years later discovered her first fictional hero in a French magazine for children, thus capturing the heroic vision which sustained her throughout her life. At the age of nine, she decided to make fiction writing her career. Thoroughly opposed to the mysticism and collectivism of Russian culture, she thought of herself as a European writer, especially after encountering Victor Hugo, the writer she most admired.                    During her high school years, she was eyewitness to both the Kerensky Revolution, which she supported, and&mdash;in 1917&mdash;the Bolshevik Revolution, which she denounced from the outset. In order to escape the fighting, her family went to the Crimea, where she finished high school. The final Communist victory brought the confiscation of her father's pharmacy and periods of near-starvation. When introduced to American history in her last year of high school, she immediately took America as her model of what a nation of free men could be.           When her family returned from the Crimea, she entered the University of Petrograd to study philosophy and history . Graduating in 1924, she experienced the disintegration of free inquiry and the takeover of the university by communist thugs. Amidst the increasingly gray life, her greatest pleasures were Viennese operettas and Western films and plays. Long an admirer of cinema, she entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting. It was at this time that she was first published: a booklet on actress Pola Negri (1925) and a booklet titled &ldquo;Hollywood: American Movie City&rdquo; (1926), both reprinted in 1999 in Russian Writings on Hollywood .           In late 1925 she obtained permission to leave Soviet Russia for a visit to relatives in the United States. Although she told Soviet authorities that her visit would be short, she was determined never to return to Russia. She arrived in New York City in February 1926. She spent the next six months with her relatives in Chicago, obtained an extension to her visa, and then left for Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter.           On Ayn Rand&rsquo;s second day in Hollywood, Cecil B. DeMille saw her standing at the gate of his studio, offered her a ride to the set of his movie The King of Kings, and gave her a job, first as an extra, then as a script reader. During the next week at the studio, she met an actor, Frank O&rsquo;Connor, whom she married in 1929; they were married until his death fifty years later.           After struggling for several years at various nonwriting jobs, including one in the wardrobe department at the RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she sold her first screenplay, &ldquo;Red Pawn,&rdquo; to Universal Pictures in 1932 and saw her first stage play, Night of January 16th , produced in Hollywood and then on Broadway. Her first novel, We the Living , was completed in 1934 but was rejected by numerous publishers, until The Macmillan Company in the United States and Cassells and Company in England published the book in 1936. The most autobiographical of her novels, it was based on her years under Soviet tyranny.           She began writing The Fountainhead in 1935 (taking a short break in 1937 to write the anti-collectivist novelette Anthem ). In the character of the architect Howard Roark, she presented for the first time the kind of hero whose depiction was the chief goal of her writing: the ideal man , man as &ldquo;he could be and ought to be.&rdquo; The Fountainhead was rejected by twelve publishers but finally accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company. When published in 1943, it made history by becoming a best-seller through word of mouth two years later, and gained for its author lasting recognition as a champion of individualism.           Ayn Rand returned to Hollywood in late 1943 to write the screenplay for The Fountainhead , but wartime restrictions delayed production until 1948. Working part time as a screenwriter for Hal Wallis Productions, she began her major novel Atlas Shrugged , in 1946. In 1951 she moved back to New York City and devoted herself full time to the completion of Atlas Shrugged.           Published in 1957, Atlas Shrugged was her greatest achievement and last work of fiction. In this novel she dramatized her unique philosophy in an intellectual mystery story that integrated ethics , metaphysics , epistemology , politics , economics and sex . Although she considered herself primarily a fiction writer, she realized that in order to create heroic fictional characters, she had to identify the philosophic principles which make such individuals possible.           Thereafter, Ayn Rand wrote and lectured on her philosophy&mdash; Objectivism , which she characterized as &ldquo;a philosophy for living on earth.\" She published and edited her own periodicals from 1962 to 1976, her essays providing much of the material for six books on Objectivism and its application to the culture . Ayn Rand died on March 6, 1982, in her New York City apartment.           Every book by Ayn Rand published in her lifetime is still in print, and hundreds of thousands of copies are sold each year, so far totaling more than 25 million. Several new volumes have been published posthumously. Her vision of man and her philosophy for living on earth have changed the lives of thousands of readers and launched a philosophic movement with a growing impact on American culture.                     This includes Everything is Illuminated, All Quiet on the Western Front, Night, Holocaust Survival, The German Mujahid (revisited) and the Kindly Ones if you are ambitious.                     Jonathan Safran Foer is currently a professor of creative writing at NYU.          Everything is Illuminated was Foer's first novel published in 2002 when he was in his twenties and so it was considered a work of precocious genius. It chronicles a young, Jewish-American writer's attempt to research his grandfather's life in Ukraine. Jonathan, who has the same name as the book's author, is attempting to find his grandfather's shtetl, Trachimbrod. He has only a few maps and a photograph of a woman named Augustine, who is said to have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Jonathan's guide on his trip is Alex, a young Ukrainian man. They are both twenty-one. Their driver is Alex's grandfather, who claims to be blind. Accompanying the men is Grandfather's seeing-eye dog Sammy Davis Junior, Junior. The novel is comprised by three basic narratives: chapters written by Jonathan, chapters written by Alex, and letters from Alex to Jonathan. Chapters written by Jonathan describe different events in his family's history in Trachimbrod. Chapters written by Alex describe Jonathan's present trip. Letters from Alex to Jonathan reveal the two characters' growing relationship as writers and friends. This book has Safran Foer's unique postmodern style, distorting language to fit narrators even if it means ESL grammar, typographical innovations, and non-linear sequencing.           Although unconfirmed by Foer, it is speculated that the title of the book is an inspiration from a line in the novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera: 'In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia.'                     Remarque 1898-1970                     German writer, who became famous with his novel IM WESTEN NICHTS NEUES (tr. All Quiet on the Western Front , 1929), which depicted the horrors of war from the point of view of the ordinary soldiers. In his works Remarque focused largely on the collapse of the old European world and values. Although his later novels also were successful, Remarque lived in the shadow of his \"big\" first book.           \"It is just as much a matter of chance that I am still alive as that I might have been hit. In a bomb-proof dug-out I may be smashed to atoms and in the open may survive ten hour's bombardment unscratched. No soldier outlives a thousand chances. But every soldier believes in Chance and trusts his luck.\" (from All Quiet on the Western Front )           Erich Maria Remarque was born in Osnabr&uuml;ck, Lower Saxony, into modest circumstances. His ancestors were French, the family name was 'Germanized' early in the nineteeth century. Peter Franz Remark, Remarque's father, was a poorly paid bookbinder. Although Franz Remark did not show much interest in intellectual activities, except his interest in the occult, the family had a piano, and at one point in his life Remarque planned a musical career. In 1904, at the age of six, Remarque entered the Domschule (cathedral school), and four years later he moved to the Johannisschle. Remarque was \"always the best in class\", as one of his closest school friends later recalled.           For a time Remarque studied at the University of M&uuml;nster, but had to enlist in the German army at the age of 18. Remarque fought on the Western Front and was wounded several times. After his discharge Remarque had taken a teacher's course offered to veterans by the government. He taught for a year in a school, and tried also his hand as a stonecutter and a test-cardriver for a Berlin tire company.           Remarque began his writing career as a sporting journalist, eventually becoming the assistant editor of Sportbild . Among his friends was Leni Riefenstahl, who later made the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will (1935), and the two-part Olympia (1938), about the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. Remarque's wife, Jutta Zambona, \"tall, slender as a fashion model, and strikingly dressed\", as Riefenstahl described Jutta in her book of memoir later inspired heroines in his books. The marriage was stormy, and they both had extra-marital activities. His longest, intercontinental affair Remarque had with Marlene Dietrich; they met first time in Venice in the late 1930s.           Fame came with Remarque's first novel, All Quiet on the Westerns Front, which touched a nerve of the time, and sparkled off a storm of political controversy. The book, which first had been rejected by one publisher, sold 1.2 million copies in its first year. H.L. Mencken called it \"unquestionably the best story of the World War.\" Its sequel, DER WEG ZUR&Uuml;CK ( The Way Back ), appeared in 1931. It dealt with the collapse of the German Army after the war, and the fate of the surviving heroes, Ernst and his friends.           All Quiet on the Western Front is the most famous novel dealing with World War I. The book starts in 1917 after a battle, in which half of Paul B&auml;umer's company has been killed. B&auml;umer is mostly the narrator and Remarque goes through his life in flashbacks. Paul and his classmates have been encouraged by their teacher, Kantorek, to enlist the German army. B&auml;umer's group includes some school fellows, and Katczinsky, an older man. The group goes through basic training and go to the front. B&auml;umer tries to understand what is going on. He realizes that back home \"no one had the vaguest idea what we were in for. The wisest were just the poor and simple people. They knew the war to be a misfortune, whereas those who were better off, and should have been able to see more clearly what the consequences would be, were beside themselves with joy.\" Paul visits home on leave, returns to the trenches, is wounded and sent to a military hospital. In the summer of 1918 German front is pushed back, and the soldiers are waiting for the end of the war. In October, when           there is nothing much to report on the western front, Paul is killed, a week or so before the armistice. - The story is narrated in first person in a cool style, a contrast to patriotic rhetoric. Remarque records the daily horrors in the trenches, where machine guns killed millions, in laconic understatement. - \"At the next war let all the Kaisers, Presidents and Generals and diplomats go into a big field and fight it out first among themselves. That will satisfy us and keep us home.\" (Katzinsky) Lewis Milestone's film (1930), based on the novel, is a landmark of American cinema. One of the best scenes is when Paul (Lew Ayres) returns to his school and tells new students the truth. \"When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all.\" The film was denounced by Goebbels as anti-German, but the Poles banned it for being pro-German. Particularly effective were the tracking shots of soldiers attacking enemy lines. In France it was prohibited until 1962. The close-up of Paul's hand reaching for the butterfly at the end, is actually the hand of the director Milestone. - A sequel, The Road Back , was made in 1937.           With All Quiet on the Western Front Remarque became a spokesman of \"a generation that was destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells,\" as he said himself. The German defeat inspired two major war films of the year 1930 - G.W. Pabst's Westfront 1918 , adapted from a novel by Ernest Johannsen and Lewis Milestone's film based on Remarque's novel. Milestone was unhappy with the original script - he saw it changed the point of the book, and he hired his friend Del Andrews and George Abbott, a stage director, the shape the final script. The producer Carl Laemmle Junior and Milestone both hated the original ending of the book, in which Paul Baumer dies heroically. Karl Freund, the cameraman, put forward the idea of the hand stretching out toward the butterfly.           In the 1930s Remarque's books were banned in Germany by the government. All Quiet on the Western Front and The Road Back were among the works consigned to be publicly burnt in 1933 by the Nazis. Stores were ordered to stop selling his books. The film's premiere was disrupted by Nazi gangs; Remarque was accused of pacifism. It was not until the 1950s the film was shown again in West Germany. In 1938 Remarque lost his citizenship. He had moved to Switzerland in 1932 and in 1939 he emigrated to the United States, where in 1947 he became a citizen. In New York he spent much time at the Stork Club and at 21. In Hollywood he made friends with stars, including the actress Paulette Goddard (1911-1990), whom he married in 1958. Remarque had been married twice before, and to the same woman, Jutta Ilse Ingeborg Ellen Zambona, in 1925 and again in 1938. After the war Remarque settled eventually back in Switzerland, where he made his residence at Porto Ronco on the Seiss shore of Lake Maggiore. His play, DIE LETZTE STATION, about the fall of the Third Reich, was produced in Berlin in 1956. Remarque died at the Sant Agnese clinic at Locarno, on September 25, 1970. He had suffered for months from aneurysm.           \"If things went according to the death notices, man would be absolutely perfect. There you find only first-class fathers, immaculate husbands, model children, unselfish, self-sacrificing mothers, grandparents mourned by all, businessmen in contrast with whom Francis of Assisi would seem an infinite egoist, generals dripping with kindness, humane prosecuting attorneys, almost holy munitions makers - in short, the earth seems to have been populated by a horde of wingless angels without one's having been aware of it.\" (from The Black Obelisk , 1956)           Remarque's later works, depicting the political upheavals of Europe from the 1920s to the cold war, did not achieve the critical acclaim of his first novel. However, his skill to create interesting characters, fascinating plots, and balancing between realistic and sentimental scenes made him a highly popular writer. DREI KAMERADEN (1937) received good reviews and was made into a film in 1938, directed by Frank Borzage. The screenplay was written by Edward A. Paramore and F. Scott Fitzgerald , who was determined to do a good job. Fitzgerald kept completely sober, for a while. However, his contract with M-G-M was not renewed. The final scene in which the two friends of the story are joined by their ghostly comrade, has still a strong emotional charge. Several of Remarque's later novels dealt with people struggling under Nazi rule. Arch of Triumph (1946) told a story about a German refugee physician and an actress. The work was adapted into screen in 1947, starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. Remarque himself played the schoolmaster Pohlmann in A Time to Love and a Time to Die (1958), based on his novel ZEIT ZU LEBEN UND ZEIT ZU STERBEN (1954). In the story a German soldier, Ernst Graeber, on furlough from the Russian front, falls in love with his childhood friend, Elisabeth. But he must return to the trenches. The German edition was censored for its \"unnational\" passages. Douglas Sirk's film version, beautifully photographed in CinemaScope, ends dramatically in Graeber's death.           Spark of Life (1952) was a fictional documentary about life in Nazi concentration camps. The Black Obelisk (1956) was a tragi-comedy, in which Remarque explored the chaotic Germany of in the 1920s. Remarque's screenplay The Last 10 Days for G.W. Pabst's film from 1956, was based Judge Michael A. Musmanno's book 10 Days to Die , a study of the death of Hitler in a Berlin bunker. DIE NACHT VON LISSABON (1962, The Night in Lisbon), in which two refugees from Nazism flee in Portugal, and SCHATTEN IN PARADIES, depicting refugees in the United Sates, were published posthumously in English in 1971.                      Primo Levi, 1919-1987                      Italian-Jewish writer and chemist, who first gained fame with his autobiographical story SE QUESTO &Egrave; UN UOMO (1947, If This is a Man) of survival in Nazi concentration camps. For the last forty years of his life Levi devoted himself to attempting to deal with the fact that he was not killed in Auschwitz. \"The worst survived, that is, the fittest; the best all died,\" he said. Levi also published poetry, science fiction, essays, and short stories. In 1987, at the age of 67, he killed himself. Italo Calvino called Levi \"one of the most important and gifted writers of our time.\"            Consider whether this is a man,            Who labours in the mud            Who knows no peace            Who fights for a crust of bread            Who dies at a yes or a no.            Consider whether this is a woman,            Without hair or name            With no more strength to remember            Eyes empty and womb cold            As a frog in winter.            (from 'Shem&aacute;' in Collected Poems )            Primo Levi was born in Turin into a Jewish middle-class family, the son of Cesare Levi, an engineer, and Ester \"Rina\" Luzzati; she had been his secretary. His grandmother Bimba was a baroness. She and her entire family had been made barons by Napoleon, because they had supported him economically. As a youth Levi knew very little about Jewishness, but Mussolini's anti-Semitic policy soon taught Levi that it was not ''a cheerful little anomaly'' in a Catholic country. An underdeveloped, quiet boy, Levi was derided at school for his size. Through cycling and mountain climbing he acquired friends, but according to a biography he did not have any sexual experience before meeting his wife, Lucia, in 1946. Just before the Fascist racial law of 1938 forbade Jews access to academic status, Levi started his chemistry studies at the University of Turin. He graduated first in his class in 1941, the year after Italy had entered World War II as an ally of Germany. During the war Levi wrote for the resistance magazine Giustizia e Libert&agrave; .            After the collapse of Mussolini's regime, he tried to contact a partisan group in the north of Italy. Levi was captured in December 1943. \"I was twenty-four,\" Levi wrote in If This Is a Man , \"with little wisdom, no experience and a decided tendency ... to live in an unrealistic world of my own, a world inhabited by civilized Cartesian phantoms, by sincere male and bloodless female friendships.\" He was first interned in a transit camp in F&ograve;ssoli, and then, two months later, deported to the camp of Moniwitz-Auschwitz. The number 174517 was tattooed on his left forearm.            From the railroad convoy of 650 people, fifteen men and nine women survived. Levi worked at one of three I.G. Farben laboratories and was spared the gas chambers. The company made synthetic rubber for the Nazi war machine. As a chemist he knew he could safely eat cotton wool and drink paraffin. A non-Jewish guest worker secretly gave him extra helpings of soup. To his friend Jean Samuel he taught Italian by quoting Dante; eating and translating Dante were both keys to survival. Dante remained a constant point of reference throughout Levi's writing. From the Ulysses episode of Inferno he chose a passage, which dealt with the crucial question \"What is a man?\" Levi's superior in the laboratory, Dr. Ferdinand Mayer, gave him a pair of leather shoes.            Liberated by the Soviets in January 1945, Levi returned to Turin in October. He took up his work as a chemist, living in a stately old building that his family had occupied for three generations. In 1961 Levi became the general manager of a factory producing paints. He retired in 1977 to become a full-time writer. With Hety Schmitt-Maas, whose husband had been a chemist for I.G. Farben, Levi corresponded almost 20 years. She also helped Levi to track down Dr. Meyer and sent him German books and newspaper clippings on Nazism.            His prison recollections Levi wrote in the form of a memoir, Se questo &egrave; un uomo , which documented how the camp deprived prisoners of their identity and finally annihilated them. When the major publisher Einaudi rejected the work, it was published by a small house. Ten years later it was reprinted in an enlarged edition. In Italy the book sold over half a million copies, was translated into eight languages and adapted for the theater and radio. Part of the book's impact was based on Levi's sober and precise style. In spite of the brutality to which he was subjected Levi described the terrible events objectively like an observing scientist, but also noted with compassion the heroism in the suffering.            Its sequel, LA TREGUA (1963), portrayed Levi's wanderings in war-torn eastern Europe in Poland, Belorussia, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania. During the journey Levi meets a gallery of colorful, rootless companions in misfortune, among them Mordo Nahum, a Greek, from whom Levi learns that in war you must first think of shoes, then the food. Without shoes you can't go after food. Levi returns home on the last pages of his account, but he has a continual nightmare in which his present life turns out to be a mere illusion and he wakes up with Auschwitz's morning call: \"Wstawac\". But Levi also uses his experiences as a basis for philosophical meditations, which connects the book to Jorge Sempr&uacute;n's L'&eacute;criture ou la vie (1994, Literature or Life), dealing with the return to life after the camp.            \"It is not at all an idle matter trying to define what a human being is.\"                        LA CHIAVE A STELLA (1978, The Monkey's Wrench) presented vivid stories told by Libertini Faussone, a construction worker and self-educated philosopher. The writer-chemist listens to him, and records his experiences in different parts of the world. \"All kids dream of going into the jungle or the desert of Malaya, and I also had those dreams, only I like to have my dreams come true; otherwise they're like some disease you carry around with you all your life, or like the scar of an operation that, whenever the weather turns damp, it starts aching again.\" Among Levi's other works is IL SISTEMA PERIODICO (The Periodic Table, 1975), which uses the Russian chemist Mendeleyev's periodical table of elements as the basis of autobiographical meditations. Its 21 pieces are each named after a chemical element. \"Every element brings a kind of 'click' for me,\" Levi wrote. \"It triggers a memory.\" 'Argon' is a homage to the author's Jewish ancestors. 'Vanadium' represents Levi's uncanny encounter with a former official in Auschwitz, Dr. M&uuml;ller, who was the chief of the laboratory, and 'Zinc', a boring metal, explorers the fascist myth of racial purity. SE NON ORA, QUANDO? (1989, If Not Now, When?) combined the emergence of Jewish consciousness and documentation of action taken on the Russian front by partisan Jewish groups against retreating Nazi forces. A group of Jewish partisans moves toward Palestine, blows up trains, and rescues victims of concentration camps.             \"Two years before the war began, the bell rope broke. It snapped near the top; the stairs were rotten; the bell ringer was an old man, and he was afraid to climb up there and put in a new rope. So after he announced the time by shooting a hunting rifle into the air; one shot, or two or three or four, That went on till the Germans came. They took his gun away from him, and the village was left without any time.\" (from If Not Now, When? )             Levi died in Turin on April 11, 1987. His death was apparently a suicide - Levi hurled himself down the central stairwell of his home building. Before and after Auschwitz Levi had suffered from depression, but his death was interpreted as a sign that he had not triumphed over his horrible experiences. In a lecture in 1979 Levi had expressed his deeply pessimistic view of humanity, seeing life as terrible. The last work he completed was the essay collection I SOMMERSI E I SALVATI (1986), where Levi returned to his belief in the historical uniqueness of the Holocaust. He asked how much of the camp is alive and well in our time, and how long it will remain in our memories. Levi points out that anti-Semitism was part of German culture, not merely a Nazi invention, and sees a paradoxical analogy between victim and oppressor. In the camp system also the oppressed unconsciously strove to identify with their oppressor. Useless violence dehumanises both guards and prisoners. \"Before dying the victim must be degraded, so that the murderer will be less burdened by guilt,\" he stated.                                   Elie Wiesel's statement, \"...to remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all...\"stands as a succinct summary of his views on life and serves as the driving force of his work. Wiesel is the author of 36 works dealing with Judaism, the Holocaust, and the moral responsibility of all people to fight hatred, racism and genocide.             Born September 30, 1928, Eliezer Wiesel led a life representative of many Jewish children. Growing up in a small village in Romania, his world revolved around family, religious study, community and God. Yet his family, community and his innocent faith were destroyed upon the deportation of his village in 1944. Arguably the most powerful and renowned passage in Holocaust literature, his first book, Night , records the inclusive experience of the Jews:             Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.             Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.             Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.            And Wiesel has since dedicated his life to ensuring that none of us forget what happened to the Jews.            Wiesel survived Auschwitz, Buna, Buchenwald and Gleiwitz. After the liberation of the camps in April 1945, Wiesel spent a few years in a French orphanage and in 1948 began to study in Paris at the Sorbonne. He became involved in journalistic work with the French newspaper L'arche . He was acquainted with Nobel laureate Francois Mauriac, who eventually influenced Wiesel to break his vowed silence and write of his experience in the concentration camps, thus beginning a lifetime of service. Wiesel has since published over thirty books, earned the Nobel Peace Prize, been appointed to chair the President's Commission on the Holocaust, awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement and more. Due to a fateful car accident in New York in 1956, Wiesel spent a year confined to a wheelchair while recovering. It was during this year that he made the decision to become a U.S. citizen and is still today an active figure within our society, as well as fulfilling his role in Jewish politics around the world.             Wiesel's job as chairman of the President's Commission on the Holocaust was the planning of an American memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The Report to the President on the President's Commission on the Holocaust focuses on memory. Wiesel writes that the reason for creating the museum must include; denying the Nazi's a posthumous victory, honoring the last wish of victims to tell, and protecting the future of humanity from such evil recurring. Always maintaining his dedicated belief that although all the victims of the Holocaust were not Jewish, all Jews were victims of the Holocaust, Wiesel advocated placing the major emphasis of the memorial on the annihilation of the Jews, while still remembering the murder of other groups.             Guided by the unique nature of the Holocaust and the moral obligation to remember, the Commission decided to divide and emphasize the museum into areas of memorial, museum, education, research, commemoration and action to prevent recurrence. In order to come to these decisions, a group of 57 members of the Commission and Advisory Board -- including Senators, Rabbis, Christians, professors, judges, Congressmen, Priests, Jews, men and women -- traveled to Eastern Europe, Denmark and Israel to study Holocaust memorials and cemeteries and to meet with other public officials. The emotional pain and commitment required by such a trip is remarkable, and Wiesel's leadership is undeniably noteworthy.                                                                                                                             Wiesel with Yitzhak Rabin                                                 Wiesel remained chairman of the Committee until 1986. He has aided in the recognition and remembrance of Soviet Jews, the establishment of Israel and has dedicated the latter part of his life to the witness of the second-generation and the vital requirement that memory and action be carried on after the survivors have all left us. Wiesel's own words are the best explanation:            Let us remember, let us remember the heroes of Warsaw, the martyrs of Treblinka, the children of Auschwitz. They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them.             Elie Wiesel's statement, \"...to remain silent and indifferent is the greatest sin of all...\"stands as a succinct summary of his views on life and serves as the driving force of his work. Wiesel is the author of 36 works dealing with Judaism, the Holocaust, and the moral responsibility of all people to fight hatred, racism and genocide.             Born September 30, 1928, Eliezer Wiesel led a life representative of many Jewish children. Growing up in a small village in Romania, his world revolved around family, religious study, community and God. Yet his family, community and his innocent faith were destroyed upon the deportation of his village in 1944. Arguably the most powerful and renowned passage in Holocaust literature, his first book, Night , records the inclusive experience of the Jews:             Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.             Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.             Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.            And Wiesel has since dedicated his life to ensuring that none of us forget what happened to the Jews.            Wiesel survived Auschwitz, Buna, Buchenwald and Gleiwitz. After the liberation of the camps in April 1945, Wiesel spent a few years in a French orphanage and in 1948 began to study in Paris at the Sorbonne. He became involved in journalistic work with the French newspaper L'arche . He was acquainted with Nobel laureate Francois Mauriac, who eventually influenced Wiesel to break his vowed silence and write of his experience in the concentration camps, thus beginning a lifetime of service. Wiesel has since published over thirty books, earned the Nobel Peace Prize, been appointed to chair the President's Commission on the Holocaust, awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Achievement and more. Due to a fateful car accident in New York in 1956, Wiesel spent a year confined to a wheelchair while recovering. It as during this year that he made the decision to become a U.S. citizen and is still today an active figure within our society, as well as fulfilling his role in Jewish politics around the world.             Wiesel's job as chairman of the President's Commission on the Holocaust was the planning of an American memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. The Report to the President on the President's Commission on the Holocaust focuses on memory. Wiesel writes that the reason for creating the museum must include; denying the Nazi's a posthumous victory, honoring the last wish of victims to tell, and protecting the future of humanity from such evil recurring. Always maintaining his dedicated belief that although all the victims of the Holocaust were not Jewish, all Jews were victims of the Holocaust, Wiesel advocated placing the major emphasis of the memorial on the annihilation of the Jews, while still remembering the murder of other groups.             Guided by the unique nature of the Holocaust and the moral obligation to remember, the Commission decided to divide and emphasize the museum into areas of memorial, museum, education, research, commemoration and action to prevent recurrence. In order to come to these decisions, a group of 57 members of the Commission and Advisory Board -- including Senators, Rabbis, Christians, professors, judges, Congressmen, Priests, Jews, men and women -- traveled to Eastern Europe, Denmark and Israel to study Holocaust memorials and cemeteries and to meet with other public officials. The emotional pain and commitment required by such a trip is remarkable, and Wiesel's leadership is undeniably noteworthy.             Wiesel remained chairman of the Committee until 1986. He has aided in the recognition and remembrance of Soviet Jews, the establishment of Israel and has dedicated the latter part of his life to the witness of the second-generation and the vital requirement that memory and action be carried on after the survivors have all left us. Wiesel's own words are the best explanation:                         Let us remember, let us remember the heroes of Warsaw, the martyrs of Treblinka, the children of Auschwitz. They fought alone, they suffered alone, they lived alone, but they did not die alone, for something in all of us died with them.                          The German Mujahid by Boualem Sansal is also part of this cluster as well as the Islamic one. It's common knowledge that, at the end of WWII, many German war criminals fled from justice via \"ratlines\" to South American countries. Less notorious, though, are the Nazis who, like the title character of Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal's excoriating new novel found permanent refuge in Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria and Algeria. Inspired by a visit to a European-style Algerian village whose mayor was a former SS officer, and by what he views as the Arab world's \"erasure\" of the Holocaust, Sansal has written a bracingly unsentimental, ingeniously structured story that not only lays bare past collusions between German fascists and Arab governments, but draws explicit parallels between Nazism and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, all the while grappling with the emotive question: \"are we responsible for the crimes of our fathers, of our brothers, of our children?\"             The German Mujahid is narrated by Malrich, a disaffected, thuggish teenager who lives on a deprived Arab housing project outside of Paris in the mid-1990s. After being expelled from school, he'd been passing the time all too typically for a kid of his background: \"I hung around the streets, took a couple of courses and a few part time jobs, did a bit of dealing, went to the mosque, wound up in court.\" But when Malrich is seventeen, his educated and professional 33-year-old brother Rachel commits suicide and leaves behind his diaries, which turn Malrich's world upside down. He discovers that their parents, who had sent the boys from Algeria to live in Paris as children, were massacred by Islamists in their village, A&iuml;n Deb, two years earlier during Algeria's \"dirty war,\" and that when Rachel returned home to visit their graves, he unearthed a secret even more horrifying than the manner of that brutal death. The contents of a suitcase in the family home&mdash;medals, military records, and souvenirs&mdash;revealed unequivocally that Rachel and Malrich's German father, Hans Schiller, was a highly-decorated SS officer personally responsible for the extermination of thousands of Jews at Auschwitz and Buchenwald.                                      Malrich's own diary with its pitch-perfect voice&mdash;streetsmart, bemused, loyal and lovable&mdash;is interspersed with excerpts from his brother's diary, whose entries are at first measured and reflective, but become increasingly traumatized and desperate as Rachel is eaten up by guilt, rage and an obsessive need to absorb every last detail of the agonies experienced by prisoners in the camps. Retracing the steps of his father's ghastly career, Rachel \"travels back through time,\" to Germany, Austria, Poland, Turkey, and Egypt. It is while at Auschwitz and Birkenau that he decides he will kill himself, \"for my father, for his victims, I will pay in full.\"              As Malrich attempts to somehow come to terms with what has happened to him and learn about the Holocaust&mdash;which, he admits, \"he didn't know anything about&hellip;I'd heard bits and pieces, things the imam said about the Jews and other stuff I'd picked up here and there\"&mdash;he resolves that \"where my father and Rachel had failed, I had to survive.\" But both brothers' lives are inescapably determined by their father's actions. Rachel literally turns himself into a concentration camp victim, growing more emaciated and haunted until, head shaved and wearing striped pyjamas, he gasses himself on the anniversary of his father's death, \"the day Hans Schiller finally eluded the justice of men.\" Malrich, on the other hand, directs his shame outward to save his beloved \"Sensitive Urban Area, Category 1\" housing project, which has slowly but surely been taken over by Islamists who are creating \"a concentration camp,\" with an atmosphere of \"all conquering Islam.\" Telling his friends that \"we're going to live, we're going to fight,\" Malrich considers it his legacy and his duty to first declare war on the \"Nazi jihadist fuckers,\" and then to \"tell the truth, all over the world.\"              Sansal's own compulsion to tell the truth all over the world is hampered, sadly, by the reality that although The German Mujahid has won plaudits in France including the RTL-Lire Prize, has been translated into German and Hebrew, and is being published in separate American and British editions, not only are there no plans to translate it into Arabic, but Sansal's work is banned in Algeria. The author, who refers to himself as \"secular in every bone in my body,\" had published several novels that sold well in his home country, having turned to writing after retiring from his job as Director of the Algerian Ministry for Industry. But with the publication in 2006 of Poste restante: Alger. Lettre de colere et d'espoir a mes compatriots &mdash;an open letter to his fellow citizens decrying the Nationalist-Islamist regime, which he says is teaching young Algerians an edited version of history&mdash;all of his books were removed from shelves.              Such censorship is particularly ironic given Sansal's mission as an artist. In writing The German Mujahid he wanted \"to ask what it might mean to take responsibility for ensuring that such crimes are never repeated,\" and the answer the novel gives is clear: it means heeding Primo Levi's insistence to \"Remember these words&hellip;Repeat them to your children.\" In its unflinching exploration of the horrors of history and its clear-eyed journey across the entire spectrum of humanity from good to evil, The German Mujahid mesmerizes from the very first sentence and commands you not to evade or recoil. Even the comfort of a hopeful conclusion is resisted; the closest thing to a consolation offered to the reader is the knowledge that Malrich will, as he promises, survive, and some day do what Rachel had wanted to: visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem: \"I'll read the names aloud, and, after every one, I'll ask their forgiveness in my father's name.\" Yet although reaching the end will leave you drained, devastated, and reeling, you'll still want to go back to the first page and start again. Sansal is a novelist at the absolute height of his powers and has, in raking over such ugliness, created a work of extraordinary beauty.                           Jonathan Littell              Jonathan Littell&rsquo;s The Kindly Ones begins, &ldquo;Oh my human brothers.&rdquo; In so doing, he loses no time in posing the question that the next thousand pages seek to answer: How can men treat their human brothers with calculating and unrelenting cruelty? The speaker is a former SS officer. His direct address is essential to this enterprise, and more than one note of chilling irony can be heard therein. One such is his uncommon cultivation. Littell, a dual citizen of France and the United States, wrote his novel in French, and many of its first readers recognized the famous opening line (&ldquo; Fr&egrave;res humains qui apr&egrave;s nous vivez &rdquo;) of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon&rsquo;s &ldquo; Ballade des pendus ,&rdquo; in which the poet, awaiting execution, begs for clemency. Unlike Villon, however, Littell&rsquo;s narrator, Maximillian Aue, seeks no pardon&mdash;and needs none. He has already eluded capture and, more than half a century after the war&rsquo;s end, leads an outwardly tranquil life manufacturing lace in northern France, married and with two children (who know nothing of his earlier life). He has decided to tell his long, grim tale. As he does, apostrophe will turn to accusation: &ldquo;Now of course the war is over. And we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson, it won&rsquo;t happen again. But are you quite sure we&rsquo;ve learned our lesson? Are you certain it won&rsquo;t happen again?&rdquo;                            Aue&rsquo;s story begins with the entry of the German Army into Ukraine in 1941 and ends with the fall of Berlin in 1945. The intervening stations are among the most horrific the war offered, from the massacre at Babi Yar to Stalingrad to Belzec and Auschwitz. Aue notes early on that what follows is &ldquo;a bleak story, but an edifying one too, a real morality play.&rdquo; For it to be edifying, however, Aue must be something other than what&rsquo;s expected. While he may witness and commit acts few would hesitate to call evil, his evil is far from banal and in no way corresponds to a stereotype. Aue is neither a blinkered lackey nor a bloodthirsty sadist. On the contrary, he is independent-minded, sensitive, and articulate. He does not believe Nazi propaganda concerning Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, or foreigners (he is himself bisexual and half-French). Nevertheless, he is at the tip of the spear&mdash;in the SS.               The result for the reader is a thought experiment of a special sort. We are inclined to declare that killers are not my human brothers. It&rsquo;s much more difficult to see that evil is made up of the same stuff as good. In The Gulag Archipelago , Solzhenitsyn remarked that &ldquo;the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either&mdash;but right through every human heart.&rdquo; Aue makes a similar case, stressing that not only psychopaths made the Holocaust possible. There were indeed such tortured and torturing souls, but they were a tiny minority, just as they were in Rwanda, Bosnia, Chechnya, and the other places Littell has spent time working for aid organizations. Some surely loved violence and craved blood; some suffered from madnesses we may be unable to understand. But there were also those&mdash;the vast majority&mdash;whose positions we can all too easily imagine. &ldquo;There are psychopaths everywhere, all the time,&rdquo; Aue says. &ldquo;Our quiet suburbs are crawling with pedophiles and maniacs, our homeless shelters are packed with raving megalomaniacs; and some of them do indeed become a problem, they kill two, three, ten, even fifty people&mdash;and then the very same State that would without batting an eye send them to war crushes them like a blood-swollen mosquito. These sick men are nothing. But the ordinary men that make up the State&mdash;especially in unstable times&mdash;now there&rsquo;s the real danger. The real danger for mankind is me, is you.\"                           An unknown American writer (even a bilingually educated one) who attempts to write an immense novel in French would usually expect to receive nothing but mockery for his trouble. As if the linguistic effort weren't audacious enough, then there's the subject matter: an epic of World War II gore and phantasmagoria from the point of view of a reflective--but largely unrepentant--German SS officer. It's the sort of literary high-wire act that should have ended in a face plant. Instead, Jonathan Littell's The Kindly Ones somehow swept France's top literary prizes when it was published in 2006. Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette histoire?                            After a brief prologue in which the narrator introduces himself as a war criminal in hiding, the action opens with the Germans' brutal invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and concludes, almost a thousand pages later, with Berlin in ashes in 1945. The protagonist and narrator, Dr. Max Aue, bobs along with the flow and ebb of German fortunes on the Eastern Front like a stormtrooper Candide--except that he inflicts as well as endures enormous suffering.                            Aue is not only an enthusiastic Nazi, but a first-class catastrophe of misdirected sexuality. Without giving anything away about his issues, let's just say that he gives anyone in Dr. Freud's files--or Greek tragedy--a run for their money. Yet whatever sympathy the narrator may occasionally earn for his tortured personal backstory, sporadic self-awareness and reliable literary flair is quickly squandered by his willing participation in many of the Nazi regime's atrocities, as well as several that are entirely his own.                            Aue's idiosyncratic psyche is a literary creation and not--as some critics have mistakenly assumed--some kind of psychosexual explanation of Nazism of the sort once popular but now largely discarded. Littell has no grand new theories of evil to offer, and to the extent he makes the rather commonplace observation that we are all capable of it, this is actually undercut by Aue's spectacular weirdness. Nor does Littell shed much light on the \"whys\" of the Holocaust, although the attentive reader will learn plenty about the \"how\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Ever since Cervantes wrote Don Quixote, the novel has fluctuated between fact and fiction, sometimes digging so deeply into the whys of reality that fiction becomes truer than fact, or rather presents a side to reality that reveals deeper understanding. Raw reality, brutal honesty, and \"gruesome\" facts can often be too hard to take which is why relationships are coated in lies and social institutions from governments to marriages rely on censorship and suppression for the common good. As the novelist rips open the facade of lies, she reveals a frightening truth or a horror similar to what Conrad, Achebe, and Mario Vargas Llosa found in colonial Africa and South America. By definition novels are works of literary arts in which language, story-telling, structure, sequencing, and style create an aesthetic experience that contains or frames the \"truth\" they represent and often make the horror easier to stomach for both author and reader.      Heart of Darkness is based on his autobiography but like a recursive memoir, he plays with time, frames the narrative, and repeats certain salient conversations, incidents, and images to go deeper into the essential evil he found in every man, an evil that the African jungle exposed in its \"darkness.\" As a master prose stylist, he uses rich figurative language, rhythm, and tone color to give his horror an aesthetic form and the frame to distance the narration because the raw truth devastated him. What techniques do authors use to make the truth palatable?        As an orphan and exile, Conrad left his homeland to roam the seas during those scary years of rabid colonialism. For twenty years he led the practical life of a sailor, somehow managing to survive the worst misadventures. But his six months in the Congo under Leopold II were horrific. He was on a river boat that made its way to Stanley Falls, he got sick, and his job was to take out an even sicker agent like Kurtz who also died en route. He left disillusioned and disgusted with the entire African misadventure. And so he had to write about it.      Achebe lived in Nigeria and his Things Fall Apart is based on the real life of indigenous people and the history of the area. However, he structures this book as a Shakespearean tragedy with Okonkwo playing the \"king\" with the dramatic flaw--his machismo, pride, temper, stubbornness--that cause his misfortunes as much as the colonialists. This dramatic balance gives more weight to the novel where Africans are not just victims of greedy white colonialists but flawed persons in their own right who make fatal mistakes. He also sees the flaws of the culture and the inhumanity of their superstitions and beliefs especially regarding the killing of children. Yet Achebe took Conrad's writing literally and analyzed it as if it were of his time, 50 years later, which hardly seems fair. The irony is that Achebe benefited immensely from the British system of education, the British literary canon, and the English language. He became a scholar and professor, published his immensely successful Things Fall Apart in 1958 and spent most of his life in the U.S., in Ivy League schools like Bard on the Hudson for 15 years and his final days at Brown. He died in Boston March 21, 2013. Although he protested against Conrad's \"racism\" and fought against the Biafran war and other injustices, his life was that of a English language professor and novelist. In other words, he owed his career to his British education and opportunities and so there are many sides to colonialism. Most of his writing is in a realistic mode but he draws from African folk tales as well as the British canon.      The bottom line is that every culture has something good to offer and something bad to repudiate, i.e. there is no black and white in the literal sense.                    This book is long but brilliant! Quite simply, it's the sheer virtuosity of Littell's writing, which shines through in Charlotte Mandel's English translation, and does not falter even in rendering the most technically difficult and morally uncomfortable tableaus. His inventiveness jolts crackling energy into familiar history--an absolutely startling 87-page dive into the Battle of Stalingrad at the center of the novel being only one outstanding example. The awful grandeur of the subject, the breadth and depth of the author's historical research, the ease with which he shifts from naturalism to surrealism and allegory to farce, his perfect ear for dialogue in what is not only a foreign language but a completely alien way of thinking, the fearlessness with which he portrays the repellent--all of these are marks of a monumental achievement. If literary power is a function of ambition multiplied by ability, this book is simply off the charts.           Many readers will be overwhelmed by the violence of these blood-soaked pages, others by the often-numbing bureaucratic detail of how it was unleashed. Some will find unendurable the Nazi ideology spouted at length by Aue and other characters (though not endorsed, it goes without saying, by the author). Those left unoffended by the foregoing will still have to contend with Littell's exhaustive--and I mean exhaustive--fleshing out of Aue's tormented sexuality. But even this side of the story is told with uncommon skill, and convincingly embedded with the tale of Germany's rampage and destruction.                                    Most of classical Holocaust literature is written in a graceful, realistic, minimal style. What happens when the language were Gothic, over-the-top, satirical, funny, and exaggerated like Foer's book? What does language do to the tragedy of these events? How do authors like Littell and Sansal capture the voice of the other? What do you think of evil and good?                           Communist China                                          Gao Xingjian, born January 4, 1940 in Ganzhou (Jiangxi province) in eastern China, is today a French citizen. Writer of prose, translator, dramatist, director, critic and artist. Gao Xingjian grew up during the aftermath of the Japanese invasion, his father was a bank official and his mother an amateur actress who stimulated the young Gao's interest in the theatre and writing. He received his basic education in the schools of the People's Republic and took a degree in French in 1962 at the Department of Foreign Languages in Beijing. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) he was sent to a re-education camp and felt it necessary to burn a suitcase full of manuscripts. Not until 1979 could he publish his work and travel abroad, to France and Italy. During the period 1980-87 he published short stories, essays and dramas in literary magazines in China and also four books: Premier essai sur les techniques du roman moderne / A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction (1981) which gave rise to a violent polemic on \"modernism\", the narrative A Pigeon Called Red Beak (1985), Collected Plays (1985) and In Search of a Modern Form of Dramatic Representation (1987). Several of his experimental and pioneering plays - inspired in part by Brecht, Artaud and Beckett- were produced at the Theatre of Popular Art in Beijing: his theatrical debut with Signal d'alarme / Signal Alarm (1982) was a tempestuous success, and the absurd drama which established his reputation Arr&ecirc;t de bus / Bus Stop (1983) was condemned during the campaign against \"intellectual pollution\" (described by one eminent member of the party as the most pernicious piece of writing since the foundation of the People's Republic); L'Homme sauvage / Wild Man (1985) also gave rise to heated domestic polemic and international attention.      In 1986 L'autre rive / The Other Shore was banned and since then none of his plays have been performed in China. In order to avoid harassment he undertook a ten-month walking-tour of the forest and mountain regions of Sichuan Province, tracing the course of the Yangzi river from its source to the coast. In 1987 he left China and settled down a year later in Paris as a political refugee. After the massacre on the Square of Heavenly Peace in 1989 he left the Chinese Communist Party. After publication of La fuite / Fugitives , which takes place against the background of this massacre, he was declared persona non grata by the regime and his works were banned. In the summer of 1982, Gao Xingjian had already started working on his prodigious novel La Montagne de l'&Acirc;me / Soul Mountain , in which - by means of an odyssey in time and space through the Chinese countryside - he enacts an individual's search for roots, inner peace and liberty. This is supplemented by the more autobiographical Le Livre d'un homme seul / One Man's Bible .      A number of his works have been translated into various languages, and today several of his plays are being produced in various parts of the world. In Sweden he has been translated and introduced by G&ouml;ran Malmqvist, and two of his plays ( Summer Rain in Peking , Fugitives ) have been performed at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.      Gao Xingjian paints in ink and has had some thirty international exhibitions and provides the cover illustrations for his own books.

Vols. 27 &amp; 28, 1995-96.                        Soul Mountain is my favorite Chinese book because it depicts the ecological and history of China set in the oppressive world on Chinese communism where Buddhism and Confucianism form a spectral backdrop and the style is forged through an innovative postmodern use of the pronouns I, he, she, and you that deconstructs the psyche in a unique Chinese version of psychoanalysis that holds true to the sense of actual place and geography in the Eastern landscape.      While Gao&rsquo;s thinking may have some kinship with Lockean empiricism, he has taken his thinking and experience further into another area&mdash;his spatial deconstruction of self into nature, the past, and Buddhist and Taoist philosophy. The four pronouns experience nature differently even as the narrator travels through the mountains as a single human entity, a bit the way lone hikers &ldquo;dissolve&rdquo; after hours of hacking through the Appalachian trail. I think he won the Nobel Prize in part because he offered this new vision of self based on his experiences with the Cultural Revolution, his brush with death, his study of Euro-existentialism, and his ability to dissolve into nature as a hiker. Like much of Chinese culture, the deconstruction is spatial. Although there are dreams in this novel, his perception of self is deliberately fractured into he, you, I, and she.       the linear direction of a purposeful &ldquo;will.&rdquo; So his immurement is transcended by dissolving the conventional sense of self, wrapped up in the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of conditioning, particularly Maoist thought, to experience the sensuality of all aspects of mind/body/spirit and the fusion of experience in the divine now where he plays with the Zen koan of God as a frog. How does this sense of self differ or enhance previous definitions in Euro-American and Arabic literature or even your perceptions of your self in the entrepreneurial workplace? He won the Nobel in part because of the creative spatial deconstruction of self and courageous journey into nature and the past when such trips were censored and politically blasphemous.             Born in China in 1954, Dai Sijie is an award-winning author and filmmaker. Caught up in China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution, he was \"re-educated\" between 1971 and 1974, and spent time working in a camp in a rural part of Sichuan province. After his re-education, he completed high school and university in China before departing for France in 1984 on a scholarship. He directed his first film in 1989. His first novel, Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress was published in France in 2000. The translation became a national bestseller in America.             Sijie currently lives and works in Paris, France.       The Chinese Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and early 1970s was, of course, anything but. Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress describes the lives of the narrator and his close friend Luo during those years, as they are sent to a remote region for re-education by the peasants in 1971, when they are in their late teens. Neither is even a high school graduate yet, but as the sons of doctors they are suspicious -- obviously tainted by their bourgeois intellectual backgrounds -- and so, like millions of others of Chinese of the time, forced to participate in this disastrous social experiment.         They are sent to a truly remote corner of China: the alarm clock they bring along is the only timepiece in town, and it's a considerable journey even just to a place where movies are occasionally shown. Life is dreary and hard there, but the power of storytelling offers some respite: Luo and the narrator are sent to watch the films shown in the distant town and then re-tell them for the locals.         The power of storytelling becomes even more convincing when they come upon a stash of books that another acquaintance of theirs, being re-educated nearby, has managed to hoard. Books -- except, of course, the writings of Mao and perhaps Enver Hoxha -- are dangerous objects in this time (and nearly everyone they encounter is illiterate). The reactions of Luo and the narrator -- and then those they relate the stories they have read to -- perhaps explain why: Dai does an excellent job of conveying the rapture of losing oneself in the words and stories found in these books, so very different from the oppressive, dreary, and dangerous everyday lives of everyone here. They are all translated works: Balzac, Dumas, Romain Rolland, Tolstoy, Dickens, and more -- a treasure-trove of classical Western literature.         Four-Eyes, whose books they are, is unwilling to share his treasure, but after Luo and the narrator's appetite has been whetted by a sampling of Balzac they will do almost anything to get their hands on the suitcase containing these works. They are particularly eager also because not only are they invigorated by the marvels contained in the books, but they see what effect the words can have on others -- notably the little Chinese seamstress who lives fairly nearby.         The power of the books is great, the recounted stories intoxicating to those who the two share them with. And the books are of great value in this world, the only currency the two have to save the lives of one of the characters at one point. The books change several lives in the novel, showing that even in the darkest times imaginations (and ambitions) can not be entirely fettered.         Beside the books, Dai also offers a good small picture of China during the Cultural Revolution -- the small (and great) outrages, the petty humiliations, the people who managed to get by better than others within the system (notably Four-Eyes and his mother), the incredible poverty in the Chinese countryside. The book moves too quickly over much of this, offering a few episodes to focus on and skipping over long periods of (admittedly probably very dreary) time. Still, it offers a good glimpse of China during the Cultural Revolution, and of the power of literature (and the deep loathing for a system and people who keep literature out of the hands of readers).                   Anchee Min&rsquo;s (b 1956) writing has been praised for its raw, sharp language and historical accuracy. Her bestselling memoir, RED AZALEA, the story of her childhood in communist China, has been compared to THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK. Min credits the English language with giving her a means to express herself, arming her with the voice and vocabulary to write about growing up during China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution. &ldquo;There was no way for me to describe those experiences or talk about thoLike every child of her generation, Min was taught to write &ldquo;Long Live Chairman Mao!&rdquo; before she was taught to write her own name. She believed in Mao and Communism. At the age of 17, Min was sent to a labor camp near East China Sea, where she discovered the truth of Mao&rsquo;s calling. She endured mental and physical hardships, which included a severe spinal cord injury. She worked for three years before talent scouts spotted her toiling in a cotton field. Madame Mao, preparing to take over China, was looking for a leading actress for a propaganda film. Min was selected for having the ideal &ldquo;proletarian&rdquo; look. Mao died before the film was complete, and Madame Mao, blamed for the disaster of the revolution, was sentenced to death. Min was labeled a political outcast by association. She was disgraced, punished, and forced to perform menial tasks in order to reform herself. In 1984, with the help of a friend overseas, Min left China for America. She spoke no English when she arrived in Chicago, but within six months had taught herself the language in part by watching &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Roger&rsquo;s Neighborhood&rdquo; on American television.              Since the completion of RED AZALEA, Min has written six subsequent works of historical fiction: KATHERINE, BECOMING MADAME MAO, WILD GINGER, EMPRESS ORCHID, THE LAST EMPRESS, PEARL OF CHINA. The books attempt to re-record histories that have been falsely written. &ldquo;If my own history is recorded falsely, how about other people?&rdquo; she asks. Both critics and writers have praised her work, calling it &ldquo;historical fiction of the first order.&rdquo; Her most recent book, PEARL OF CHINA (April 2010/Bloomsbury), is a fictional account of the 40 years that writer Pearl S. Buck spent in China..              September 29, 2000             TBR: With so much having been written already about Madame Mao, what made you choose her as your subject for your novel, BECOMING MADAM MAO?             AM: It was the process, the process of how she, a beautiful woman who once possessed tremendous innocence, turned into a monster. I hadn't seen that done before.             TBR: What was your research process like? How much of what you knew of her as a historical figure was correct and what new things did you learn about her that you found fascinating?             AM: The research process was long and hard. It took me five years just to get my notes straight. Most of the crime she was accused of was correct. What's fascinating to learn was that Mao was behind her in her major moves, i.e. the Cultural Revolution. I had the idea most people had at the beginning: that she was simply a power-craver, a White-bone-demon as she is universally known. I was surprised to discover a lot of human side to her. The Jiang Ching Madame Mao as a lover, a wife, and a mother.             TBR: Ultimately, what will her legacy be, as an icon and as a woman?             AM: To the people of China she would most likely remain her official title as the White-bone-demon for quite a time. To me she would be an icon of a very sad time and a woman who lost her soul to demons as she rebelled against the society, which treats women as grass to be walked on.             TBR: Is the title also a reference to your BECOMING MADAME MAO since you wrote the book in the first person and thus created a voice for Madame Mao --- did you channel her through your own sensibilities?             AM: Not really, although I did channel her through my own sensibilities. It was not natural for me to think of her in that way. It was a difficult writing process. On the one hand I had to do her justice, which meant that I shouldn't be judgmental; on the other, I had a hard time comprehending her in many cases. For example, I couldn't bring myself to justify the lives she had taken during the Cultural Revolution in order to revenge and protect her career. She was heartless and purely evil. I hated her.             TBR: How did your writing change after the enormous success of your memoir RED AZALEA?             AM: The main change was the self-confidence. I started to believe that I could write. So I pushed myself to be more original, creative, and to develop the courage to deal with failure when it happens.             TBR: What was the most difficult thing about writing RED AZALEA?              AM: To live the time over again. It was painful.               TBR: How was writing KATHERINE, your first novel, different from your experience writing BECOMING MADAME MAO?               AM: The scale was much larger both in background and characters. There were four major characters in KATHERINE while more than twenty in BECOMING MADAME MAO. Also, I had to follow the record of history tightly in BECOMING MADAME MAO. It was a totally different experience.               TBR: When did you decide to be a writer? As a former actress, what skills did you learn in that art form that affected your writing life?               AM: I didn't decide. The reason I wrote was to learn English so I could graduate from college and get a job to be a small firm secretary. I never dared to dream. I was a new immigrant and survival was the only thing on my mind at the time. Talking about being a former actress, I was never one to begin with. Madame Mao's people picked me from a cotton field for the way I looked --- a proletarian peasant, not that I had any acting skills. I love writing because I don't have to show my face. I had a chance to be exposed to a lot of classic monologues while studying acting. Maybe that affected my writing.               TBR: How do you see the Internet affecting the future of fiction? Do you read ebooks or books online?               AM: The Internet is affecting everything on the face of the earth. Future fiction has to be created unique enough in a non-replaceable form to survive and thrive. I haven't had the chance to explore ebooks or books online yet.               TBR: Would you ever consider writing a story or book that would only be available online?               AM: I need to give the idea some thought before I know what I am talking about on this issue.               TBR: Do you believe that the sharing of history like this can help to change the contemporary world? By learning from the past?               AM: Definitely.               TBR: What books and authors have influenced you the most throughout your life?               AM: I have to give you a list of Chinese names. Most of these authors are unknown to the western public, i.e. Tang Xian-zu of 1200. I read him when I was 14 in a dark storage where Red Guards placed their rooted goods.               TBR: What are you reading now?               AM: Historical documents. I am doing it for my next project. In fact, I just got back from China last week. I spent my summer digging out books in the basement of the Museum of History in Shanghai. Every time I got in, I felt like a cockroach being sprayed --- the book-storage is heavily sprayed with chemicals in order to prevent the bugs from eating the pages away. It is a place filled with treasure --- lots of out of print and lost books. Material that is crucial to my subject. I am reading everything that interests me around the late Qing Dynasty 1800-1911.               TBR: In one sentence, what is one piece of invaluable advice you have picked up over the years of writing?               AM: I ask myself, \"Will you still write if this piece doesn't get published?\" If the answer is yes, then I know that I meant to write it.               To learn more about the Cultural Revolution, go to web link where Professor Keefer uploaded original librettos of the operas that her Canadian father attended while doing business with the Chinese when trade was closed with the U.S.                                                                                            Atwood claims her novels are speculative fiction, not sci fi, because she does meticulous research with her team on subjects like bioengineering, firewalls and hacking, food production, and global warming and then imagines or speculates on what kind of world to create for her characters.

Second draft of webfolios due. Be prepared  to read aloud. Group discussions on &quot;How to find and develop good  stories&quot; and &quot;The American Dream.&quot;   New York-- The Twenties versus  the Nineties. Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Even though  they symbolize the American Dream, what are the prisons embedded in The Great  Gatsby, Jazz and Cosmopolis? Is your American Dream just to be--  happy? Remember this when we get to Brave New World. In the twenties, the  American Dream was Forbidden Fruit for many Americans. Langston Hughes captures  this dilemma brilliantly in his poem, Harlem--   What happens to a dream  deferred?   Does it dry up   Like a raisin in the sun?   Or does it fester like a sore -   And then run?   Does it stink like rotten meat?   Or crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet?   Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.   Or does it explode?   The following is my favorite descriptive  passage from The Great Gatsby because I love the way he personifies the lawn  and uses kinesthetic imagery to capture the brazen energy and grandiosity of  the nouveau riche and the role the women, particular Daisy, play in this  splendid charade-- &quot;Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a  cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn  started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile,  jumping over sun-dials and brick walls and burning gardens--finally when it  reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the  momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing  now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom  Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.   He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw-haired man  of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining,  arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the  appearance of always leaning aggessively forward. Not even the effeminate swank  of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed to  fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see  a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It  was a body capable of enormous leverage--a cruel body....   We walked through a huge hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely  bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and  gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way  into the house. A breeze blew thorugh the room, blew curtains in at one end and  out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake  of the ceiling-- and then ripple over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on  it as wind does on the sea.   The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on  which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an achored balloon. They  were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they  had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have  stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the  groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the  rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and  the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.&quot;  (11-12) Note the synesthesia--&quot;groan of a picture,&quot; the use of dashes  to make the description dynamic, and the way these short passages show how  completely Tom dominates the scene, physically, sexually, materially--but maybe  not spiritually.   Note how DeLillo deconstructs his  journey through Manhattan. Is the author seeping in through Benito? Is this a  naturalistic journey? DeLillo does not orchestrate his characters, although he  is a fierce and fabulous social critic. Every word must succumb to his personal  style--   DeLillo simply and vividly describes  his raison d'etre-- &quot;I am a sentence maker. Like a donut maker, only  slower,&quot; or &quot;Every sentence has a truth waiting at the end of it and  the writer learns how to know it when he finally gets there. On one level this  truth is the swing of the sentence, the beat and poise, but down deeper it's  the integrity of the writer as he matches with the language. I've always seen  myself in sentences. I begin to recognize myself, word by word, as I work  through a sentence. The language of my books has shaped me as a man. There's a  moral force in a sentence when it comes out right. It speaks the writer's will  to live....The words typed on the page have a sculptural quality. They form odd  correspondences. They match up not just through meaning but through sound and  look. The rhythm of a sentence will accomodate a certain number of syllables.  One syllable too many, I look for another word. There's always another word  that means the same thing, and if it doesn't then I'll consider altering the  meaing of a sentence to keep the rhythm, the syllable beat. I'm completely  willing to let language press meaning upon me. Watching the way in which words  match up, keeping the balance in a sentence--these are sensuous pleasures. I  type rather than write longhand because I like the way words and letters look  when they come off the hammers onto the page--finished, printed and beautifully  formed.&quot;   Futuristic America-- Brave New  World by Aldous Huxley. How do Huxley's predictions still apply to the world of  clones and bioengineering? Have our values changed since the 1930s? Is  happiness incompatible with art, science, monogamous love and family ties? What  would happen if there were no death? If old age, suffering, weakness and  disease were abolished, would that also mean the end of religion? If everyone  were happy on earth, would we need God? What is your ideal designer baby? If  you could stop aging at 50 and stay the same for the next fifty years, would  you do it? What would happen if everyone did? What do you think of nursing  homes and early retirement? Should people just 'hang out' for thirty years,  living off the state?     At one point in most writers' careers, they tackle the unknown, ineffable and potentially blasphemous task of imagining god and personifying prophets. Like Nikos Kazantzakis, they can be a believing Christian who creates a more sensuous, tormented version of Christ tortured by temptation as he struggles with the demands of divinity. Or they can be like Aldous Huxley as he creates an alternative religion based on a distortion of science, bioengineering, and technology where people worship Our Ford instead of Our Lord. Where is god in books like The Bluest Eye, Lolita, The Sand Child, or The Patience Stone? In Saadawi's books, God often dies (or at least the personification of him or his embodiment in corrupt leaders), or resigns as in her censored play. But in God Resigns at the Summit Meeting , Eve, Bint Allah, and Isis offer humanity alternatives as female deities. Naguib Mahfouz and Salman Rushdie almost lost their lives for personifying Mohammad in Children of Gebelaawi (of the Alley) and Satanic Verses because they made him flawed--a womanizer and a hashish smoker. Where is god in books like The German Mujahid, The Kindly Ones, Night, and If This is a Man? God lets these stories be told but he also didn't stop the holocaust. In Gao Xi Jiang's Soul Mountain , God is a frog with one eye open and one blinking. Savoring the moment of falling snow is as close as we get to paradise.      For a scientific perspective on imagining god, I recommend Alan Lightman's new book Mr. G. Like Einstein's Dreams, this short novel is based on a lifetime of study as a prominent theoretical physicist and in its pithy prose poetry invites us to imagine the creation of our world, our galaxy, and an infinite number of galaxies. I met Lightman at an MIT conference in 2006 where I was invited to give a paper on the personification of particle physics in my narrators in my trilogy of novels published in 2006, now censored by the Dean. MIT was one of the few places that actually understood what I did in my novels, (London, Paris, and Tel Aviv were the others) in part because of the work Lightman has done for years as Humanities and Physics Professor and author of extraordinary compressed, brilliant prose poetry. I personally prefer longer, linguistically complex works, but Lightman is one of the few minimalist writers I adore probably because his intellect is so maximal. Even if you have no time at all because you are so busy with work and school, spend five minutes every night reading a chapter of this book and reflecting on it as you go to sleep. You will get a deeper understanding of science and religion as well as ideas to stimulate your own imagination and sense of wonder. Unlike Joyce and Rushdie, Lightman's writing is simple and clear, but it reflects the same depth of research, understanding, and knowledge, albeit in a different area. Lightman is one of the great writers of our century.

I just want to caress you a little.I just want to   kiss you a little--your lips, your throat, your breasts. I just want to embrace   you a little. I just want to comfort you a little. I just want to hold you tight!--like   this. I just want to measure you skeleton with my arms. These are strong, healthy   arms, aren't they. I just want to poke my tongue in your ear. Don't giggle!   Don't squirm! This is serious! This is the real thing! I just want to suck a   little. I just want to press into you a little. I just want to penetrate you   a little. I just want to ejaculate into you a little. It won't hurt if you don't   scream but you'll be hurt if you keep straining away like that, if you exaggerate.   Thank you, I just want to squeeze you a little. I just want a taste of it. Your   saliva, your blood. Just a taste. A little. You've got plenty to spare. You're   being selfish. You're being ridiculous. You're being cruel. You're being unfair.   You're hysterical. You're hyperventilating. You're provoking me. You're laughing   at me. You want to humiliate me. You want to make a fool of me. You want to   gut me like a chicken. You want to castrate me. You want to make me fight for   my life, is that it?

Writing and reading...require being alert and ready for unaccountable beauty,   for the intricateness or simple elegance of the writer's imagination, for the   world that imagination evokes. Both require being mindful of the places where   imagination sabotages itself, locks its own gates, pollutes its vision. Writing   and reading mean being aware of the writer's notions of risk and safety, the   serene achievement of, or sweaty fight for, meaning and response-ability.   Whatever may be their use in civilised societies, mirrors are   essential to all violent and heroic action.   Poets are men who refuse to utilize language.   Some say it is best not to go near the center of time. Life   is a vessel of sadness, but it is noble to live life, and without time there   is no life. Others disagree. They would rather have an eternity of contentment,   even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly mounted in a case.   \"Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates success.\"   That is a man's sentence;...it was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman's   use....Moreover a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences   built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been   made by men out of their own needs for their own uses. There is no reason to   think that the form of the epic or the poetic play suits a woman any more than   the sentence suits her. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands--   another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels.   The \"engaged\" writer knows that words are actions.   Writers are among the most sensitive, the most intellectually   anarchic, most representative, most probing of artists. The ability of writers   to imagine what is not the self, to familiarize the strange and mystify the   familiar, is the test of their power. The languages they use and the social   and historical context in which these languages signify are indirect and direct   revelations of that power and its limitations.   Why write? Each one has his reasons: for one, art is a flight;   for another, a means of conquering.   One of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the   need of feeling that we are essential in relation to the world.   All our literature and art are for the masses of the people,   and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created   for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.   ...a great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes   place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all its faculties.   Like a domestic animal, time doesn't move without human beings'   strict supervision.   When the words form under his pen, the author doubtless sees   them, but he does not see them as the reader does, since he knows them before   writing them down. The function of his gaze is not to reveal, by stroking them,   the sleeping words which are waiting to be read, but to control the sketching   of the signs.   What does death matter? Communism is the truth. Because they   appear almost always in conjunction with representations of black or Africanist   people who are dead, impotent, or under complete control, these images of blinding   whiteness seem to function as both antidote for and meditation on the shadow   that is companion to this whiteness-- a dark and abiding presence that moves   the hearts and texts of American literature with fear and longing.   Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images.   Race has become metaphorical-- a way of referring to and disguising   forces, events, classes, and expressions of social decay and economic division   far more threatening to the body politic than biological \"race\" ever was.   It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be   woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress   on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak   consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech for anything written   with that conscious bias is doomed to death. It ceases to be fertilised. ...Some   collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before   the act of creation can be accomplished.   Reading seems, in fact, to be the synthesis of perception and   creation.   In this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time   and there is body time. The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum   of iron that swings back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The second   squirms and wriggles like a bluefish at bay. The first is unyielding, predetermined.   The second makes up its mind as it goes along.... Where the two times meet,   desperation. Where the two times go their separate ways, contentment. ... Each   time is true but the truths are not the same.   There is no romance free of what Herman Melville called \"the   power of blackness,\" especially not in a country in which there was a resident   population, already black, upon which the imagination could play; through which   historical, moral, metaphysical, and social fears, problems, and dichotomies   could be articulated. The slave population, it could be and was assumed, offered   itself up as surrogate selves for meditation on problems of human freedom, its   lure and its elusiveness. This black population was available for meditations   on terror-- the terror of European outcasts, their dread of failure, powerlessness,   Nature without limits, natal loneliness, internal aggression, evil, sin, greed.   In order to know himself, each person carries his own Book   of Life, which is filled with the history of his life. ...With time, each person's   Book of Life thickens until it cannot be read in its entirety....Some have stopped   reading altogether. ... Such people walk with the limber stride of their youth.   Such people have learned how to live in a world without memory.   I fear for you young people because you do not understand how   strong is the bond of kinship. You do not know what it is to speak with one   voice. And what is the result? An abominable religion has settled among you.   A man can now leave his father and his brotheres. He can curse the gods of his   fatheres and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes mad and turns   on his master.

Course Description   Major Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Writers is an introduction to the work of significant global writers from early Modernism to the twenty-first century in the Anglo-American, European, South American, Islamic, and Asian clusters. Most of these writers have won the Nobel Prize, the Pulitzer Prize, Dublin IMPAC, the Prix Goncourt, or others, and almost all have been censored by someone at some time. These books also represent a wide range of styles including naturalist, realist, fantasy, science-fiction, modernist, minimalist, post-modern, terrorist, and eco-literary, covering a fascinating time period through two World Wars, utopias and dystopias, terrorism, media proliferation, and incredible innovation and destruction because of science, technology and the ravages of nature. Studying global literature allows us to dig deeper beneath the surface of global affairs and to plunge into the heart and soul of courageous, creative writers who dared defy the norm and transgress societal taboos in their pursuit of art and truth. This semester we will explore how great authors treat the themes of love, sex, power, and perversion across cultures with humor and compassion for an in-depth study of characterization and an overview of twentieth century cultural history.   Course Objectives     To enhance critical thinking and analytical skills through weekly close textual analyses of passages from the reading list   To sharpen skills for close textual analysis, learning the vocabulary of prosody, understanding the power of connotative language, and situating the passage within the dramatic structure and narrative sequencing of the novel   To improve your writing (voice, fluency, argumentation, expression, artistry) through weekly analyses and participation   To foster a love of great literature by reading books you might not normally read although you can choose your favorites to study in-depth from a wide selection   To get an overview of the major literary movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries by studying the content in the Lessons (scroll over this entire web site to review before you submit weekly CTs on Monday)   To experience literature from the inside, empathizing with the courageous writer who rebelled against social norms   To study the ethical, religious, intellectual, and sexual dynamics of a given society to determine why they would find certain fiction offensive   To understand and respect cultural differences and diversity without being stymied by a politically-correct protocol by comparing and contrasting great writing from different cultures in your cross-cultural midterm essay and then your final essay   To establish initiative, independence, and academic leadership by writing your midterm and final on a theme of your choice related to your interests and the reading list, using your weekly CTs as evidence   To create a positive online learning experience through group participation, discussion, and occasional cross-editing of the close textual analyses, as well as special projects such as the Creativity, Dissidence, and Egyptian Revolution, the Symposium on International Relations, Leadership, and Global Literature, the Ecodisciplinary Conference, and the Censored Literature Symposium, the Kingsolver Skype Retrospective or publishing in Professor Keefer's international online journals   THE CLASS PROJECT FOR SPRING 2015 is an uptown literary and cultural tour on April 19 at 92Y, Museum of the City of New York, El Barrio, and the Central Park Conservatory.

Introductory Lesson and Overview of Course Content by Professor Julia Keefer  The Twentieth Century was a century of tumultuous opposites: self versus state, psychoanalysis versus fascism, positive rationalism versus surrealism and Dadaism, technological advancement versus return-to-nature, science versus art, and love against death.  Lovers and other Monsters explores the underbelly of Power, Politics, and Progress that characterizes the twentieth century through a cross-cultural selection of novels and plays written by winners of the Nobel Prize, the IMPAC, the Pulitzer, and the Goncourt.  FRENCH: No Exit by Jean-Paul Sartre 1944  Three damned souls, Garcin, an army deserter, Ines, a cruel lesbian, and Estelle, a baby-killer meet in hell depicted as a Second Empire Drawing Room where sleep, dreams, and change of any kind are denied and these three misfits must torment each other for eternity. This one-act play, written at the end of the occupation in Paris in World War II, is also a dramatic manifesto of Sartre\u2019s existentialist philosophy with maxims like \u201cMan is the sum of his actions, Hell is other people, etc.\u201d  RUSSIAN: Lolita by Nabokov 1955  This exquisitely written novel is in the voice of Humbert Humbert, the pedophile protagonist whose erudite language and meticulous descriptions mask the perversity of his intentions, actions, and thoughts although the precious Lolita also uses the older men for her own designs.  AFRICAN-AMERICAN: The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison 1970  This was Morrison\u2019s first novel, a raw, beautiful, and bitter book about racism, lookism, and sexual abuse written in her distinctive style which won her the Nobel Prize.  EGYPTIAN: The Death of the Only Man on Earth Beirut 1974 was Nawal el Saadawi\u2019s original God Dies by the Nile and blends a picturesque journey of the Egyptian sun through its diurnal light and darkness as a witness to atrocious deeds committed by the powerful men in the small village of Kafr el Teen.  FRENCH: The Lover by Marguerite Duras 1984  As a seventy year old woman, Duras looked back on an affair she had with a Chinese millionaire when she lived as a teenage girl  COLOMBIAN: Love in the Time of Cholera by GG Marquez 1985  This story takes place between 1880 and 1930 in the Caribbean. Florentino and Fermina fall in love in their youth but fate and finances separate them until old age when they are finally reunited on a cholera ship. Marquez compares the trajectory of romantic love to a disease like cholera and yet at the end of his life, he said there was nothing more important than love.  GERMAN: Perfume by Patrick Suskind 1985  This is an historical thriller that takes place in eighteenth century Paris about an orphan Grenouille who lacked a smell himself but became a parfumer  GLOBAL: Lovers and other Monsters, ed. By M. Kaye 1992 (Doubleday Asimov, Poe, Wharton, Wells, Doyle et al)  AMERICAN: Black Water by Joyce Carol Oates 1992  Kelly Kelleher\u2019s liturgical death is told in a recursive, repetitive third person style with modernist and postmodern techniques as the gas and water from the swamp seep into the inside of the car that her \u201cdate\u201d The Senator crashed because of his excessive drinking at the party, a story that satirizes Chappaquiddick where Senator Kennedy may have done the same thing with Mary Jo who also died in the carr.  CHINESE: Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress by Dai Sijie 2000  Beijing censorship meets the need of young boys to explore the world through books as they also fall in love with a little seamstress and want to share with her all their forbidden fruits.  PERUVIAN: Feast of the Goat by Mario Vargas Llosa 2000  A three-pronged tandem competitive narrative situates the assassination of Trujillo against a framed story where Urania, a New York lawyer, returns to the Dominican Republic to see her aged, demented father who compromised her virginity years ago in order to please Trujillo. Here is a real monster!  AFGHANISTAN: The Patience Stone by Atiq Rahimi 2008  An unnamed archetypal Afghan woman nurses her comatose wounded warrior husband as shooting and various commotions from the war outside occasionally interrupt her long monologue where she reveals the secrets of her life to her \u201cpatience stone\u201d until he explodes.  TURKISH: Museum of Innocence by Orhan Pamuk 2009  Pamuk looks back on young, wealthy Turkish people in the seventies, describing how they lived, and how the protagonist collected all the mundane clothes, jewels, and even cigarette butts of his love Fusun in order to put them in a museum which now exists in Istanbul.                 Introduction to Close Textual Analysis                      Write out a passage from the book, approximately one page, triple-spaced, numbering every line. The triple spaces are for you to analyze meter, long and short stresses, or note figures of speech, and to really focus on the exact words the author has written.\u00a0You do not write your essay in between these spaces. Your analysis comes after the passage in standard MLA format with good sentence structure and paragraph progression. In the age of the Internet, it is easy to get literary analyses and critical theory, so it is important for you to focus on your intimate relationship with the text and what it means to you. As such, I will not be giving examples of the ideal textual analysis. In fact, there is no ideal analysis, because every text is different and you are all different from each other. It's not objective like arithmetic. This lesson will give you guidelines to help you with the vocabulary and structure of analysis, but you must make it your own, edit it,\u00a0and improve upon it throughout the semester. At this introductory level, pass/fail grades are given because analyses can always get better. I know a PhD candidate who has been analyzing Yeats for the past forty years. Be patient with yourselves, read closely, and focus carefully, but use your imaginations to interpret the text your way.       \u00a0    Analyze the passage for intrinsic and extrinsic meaning, relationship to the rest of the text, rhetorical devices, structure, and aesthetics. Even though you are concentrating on a single passage, it is important that you read the entire work to understand its relationship to the whole. First of all you must understand the denotative and connotative meanings of every word in the text. Use your thesaurus and dictionary frequently so that you understand every possible meaning, even when you think you know what is being said. Then analyze sentence structure (simple, complex, compound, compound-complex) and paragraph structure and progression in a novel or short story, dialogue and action in a play, prosody if a poem. Most of your works are novels but you should also know how to analyze poetry.       When you analyze language, place close attention to both diction, or choice of words, (formal, informal, colloquial, concrete, abstract) and rhetorical devices. Even prose passages can be scanned to determine rhythm. It is not enough to identify these devices-- you must relate them to the whole, and evaluate their impact on story, dramatic structure, narrative voice and sequencing, aesthetics, meaning, and character objectives.    \u00a0    This first close reading focuses on the HOW of the text, how the writers created the beauty and meaning from the words they chose arranged as they saw fit. By understanding prosody, style, and structure you can get better breakdown the passage into its components. Then you can ask the WHY questions that connect this form to content. Language is a symbolic and metaphoric art. To be successful, the readers must translate these black lines on the white page into images, feelings, and thoughts in their minds that bring the world to life. It may not be the exact world the writer intended, which is part of the reader-response criticism discussed in the literary theory Lesson.       Does the passage describe a natural or artificial scene and what is the degree of plausibility, suspension of disbelief? How vivid and explicit is the descriptive language? To which senses does it appeal most? Does it describe character as monologue or dialogue, explicit or unconscious? Does it describe an action, develop an argument or an idea connected with the larger world of the fiction? How is the passage sequenced, in other words, what comes before and after, and why? How does this relate to the overall dramatic structure? Is this a passage devoted to exposition, complication, turning point, crisis, climax or resolution? What are the levels of empathy or emotional involvement? Comedic techniques or devices to increase suspense and drama? In what person is the novel told? In a drama, how successfully are the characters orchestrated? How is language used aesthetically to develop theme and how his theme related to the central dramatic question and the protagonist's objectives? In this global literature course, how do style and structure reflect the taste of the indigenous culture? How does this passage compare with another one on the same content, but from a different culture? For whom is the story written? How does the narrative voice relate to audience?          After thinking about all of the above, let us go into detail on the various sections. Part I Lesson I focuses on Form, while Part II focuses on content. You must always relate the two.          FORM       Meter in poetry or grammar, sentence length, paragraph progression in prose       Rhythm in stressed and unstressed syllables       Rhyme where applicable       Tone Color including alliteration, assonance, consonance and onomatopoeia      Figures of Speech including metaphors, similes, personification, analogy                    The Music of Words                                  Read aloud your triple-spaced passage and note the sentence length, paragraph progression or prosody in poetry. How long or short are the lines, sentences, and paragraphs? What effect does this have? Always relate form to the overall meaning. In translated works, you can still analyze the length of lines, sentences and paragraphs but not the exact meter, rhythm or tone color. These are reserved for works written in English.          Meter is analyzed in terms of metric feet--iamb,u_ trochee,_u anapest, uu_dactyllic, _uu, spondee, __pyrrhic,uu. Most British poetry is written in iambic pentameter. A spondee has a finality about it while a pyrrhic is light, an anapest is a waltz rhythm, and a trochee makes you stop and think backwards.          Rhymes can come at the end of the line and a rhyme scheme can look like this A B A B C D E C D E FF, refering to the end of the line, but rhymes can also be internal. In Part III of my trilogy I have the Electoweak Force narrator talk in rhymes because it mimics the electrons. What do rhymes do to the meaning of the piece?          Words are letters taking up space on a page that when read aloud form a pattern in time. What is the overall affect of this pattern related to the meaning of the book?                           Tone Color                                          Tone color relates to the sound of the words, like movement quality amplifies dance, resonance music, and color painting. Alliteration is the repetition of the first sound like &quot;Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.&quot; Consonance is the repetition of consonants like &quot;Sister Suzie sells seashells down by the seashore.&quot; Assonance is the repetition of vowels like &quot;How now, brown cow.&quot; Onomatopoeia occurs when the tone color mimics the sound of the thing described, such as &quot;babbling brook.&quot; There are many categories of tone color, but see how the style determines how you feel about the characters and their thoughts and actions and how you experience the setting.      Again tone color is best evaluated in original, not translated works.                                    Figures of Speech                                          Figures of Speech refer to words that are used to connote other things or feelings than what is being literally described. A simile uses like or as if, such as, &quot;her eyes are like seashells,&quot; while a metaphor says something is something it is not, such as &quot;her eyes are seashells.&quot; Personification is the attribution of human characteristics to non-human entities such as the narrators in My Name is Red or Part II of my trilogy. Obviously, trees, dogs, cats, the Statue of Liberty, the Sphinx etc cannot speak English but we personify them to give depth and breadth to a story.      \u00a0      Even in translation you can evaluate figures of speech. What do they do to the experience of the passage? Some Native American writers prefer literal words and meanings because the sky and the sand are good enough, while writers like Virginia Woolf make put diamonds on waves, and describe nature in terms of human beauty. What do the figures of speech reveal about the narrators, characters and their worlds?

When he presses himself down upon her long and powerfully, when he buries his face and his limbs deep in her from the fear of death by shell-fire, then she is his only friend, his brother, his mother; he stifles his terror and his cries in her silence and her security; she shelters him and releases him for ten seconds to live, to run, ten seconds of life; receives him again and often forever.&quot; (and personification) &quot;The front is a cage in which we must await fearfully whatever may happen.&quot;     Repetition: &quot;Earth!-Earth!-Earth!&quot;     Antithesis: &quot;A man dreams of a miracle and wakes up to loaves of bread.&quot;     Parallel Construction: &quot;My feet begin to move forward in my boots, I go quicker, I run.&quot;     Simile: &quot;He had collapsed like a rotten tree.&quot;     Metaphor: &quot;Immediately a second [searchlight] is behind him, a black insect is caught between them and tries to escape--the airman.]     Liturgical prose: &quot;Our being, almost utterly carried away by the fury of the storm, streams back through our hands from thee, and we, thy redeemed ones, bury ourselves in thee, and through the long minutes in a mute agony of hope bite into thee with our lips!&quot;     Apostrophe: &quot;Ah! Mother, Mother! You still think I am a child--why can I not put my head in your lap and weep?&quot;     Allusion: &quot;The guns and the wagons float past the dim background of the moonlit landscape, the riders in the steel helmets resemble knights of a forgotten time; it is strangely beautiful and arresting.&quot;     Hyperbole: &quot;They are more to me than life, these voices, they are more than motherliness and more than fear; they are the strongest, most comforting things there are anywhere: they are the voices of my comrades.&quot;     Rhetorical question: &quot;If one wants to appraise it, it is at once heroic and banal--but who wants to do that?&quot;     Aphorism: &quot;...terror can be endured so long as a man simply ducks--but it kills, if a man thinks about it.&quot;     Symbolism: &quot;I pass over the bridge, I look right and left; the water is as full of weeds as ever.&quot;     Foreshadowing: &quot;On the landing I stumble over my pack, which lies there already made up because I have to leave early in the morning.&quot;     Doggerel: &quot;Give 'em all the same grub and all the same pay.&quot;     Short Utterances: &quot;Life is short.&quot; (Analyse for rhythm and effect.)     Cause and Effect: &quot;They have taken us farther back than usual to a field depot so that we can be re-organized.&quot;     Irony: &quot;...a high double wall of yellow, unpolished, brand-new coffins. They still smell of resin, and piine, and the forest.&quot;     Appositive: &quot;Thus momentarily we have the two things a soldier needs for contentment: good food and rest.&quot;     Caesura: &quot;It is all a matter of habit--even the front-line.&quot;     Onomatopoeia: &quot;The man gurgles.&quot;     Alliteration: &quot;The satisfaction of months shines in his dull pig's eyes as he spits out: 'Dirty hound'&quot;           Euphony: &quot;Now red points glow in every face. They comfort me: it looks as though there were little windows in dark village cottages saying that behind them are rooms full of peace.&quot;           Cacophony: &quot;The storm lashes us, out of the confusion of grey and yellow the hail of splinters whips forth the child-like cries of the wounded, and in the night shattered life groans painfully into silence.&quot;           Slang: &quot;And now get on with it, you old blubber-sticker, and don't you miscount either.&quot; &quot;That cooked his goose.&quot;       Rhetorical devices also include the syllogisms, logical fallacies etc explained at www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/brain/argue.html.

Kelly\u2019s story is told in the third person but it features flashes of the memories that swamp her mind as she slowly suffocates inside of a car at the bottom of a black lagoon. Kelly is smart, but she is also young and thus lacks experience. She is attractive, but she is not stunning and thus lacks self-confidence. She is eager and well-intended, but she is also susceptible to outside influences. When she meets the Senator, a man who was the focus of her college thesis, she is awed. When he seeks her attention in return, Kelly\u2019s story unfolds. In the telling of Kelly\u2019s tale, Oates explores the ever-resonant themes of power imbalances, particularly between men and women, and the unfortunate influence of societal pressures.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The passage cited above from Black Water embodies these two themes. The passage begins as Kelly first recalls her initial encounter with the Senator, when he told her to call him by his \u201cfirst name \u2013 his diminutive first name - of course\u201d (line 1). This is the first intimation of intimacy between them, an intimacy that the Senator initiates by requesting that she use his shortened first name. The reader never learns the Senator\u2019s name, however, as Kelly doesn\u2019t feel comfortable addressing him with anything other than his formal title: \u201cbut somehow just yet Kelly had not been able to oblige\u201d (line 2). That Kelly cannot \u201cjust yet\u201d see him as anything other than a great man with a terribly important title, despite the casual approach he takes with her throughout the story, demonstrates the power imbalance between them. The words \u201cjust yet\u201d in this sentence are deliberate on Oates\u2019 part: Kelly desperately holds onto her image of the Senator as a mighty man even while she slowly dies as a result of his actions, but she eventually comes to realize that he has abandoned her to save himself.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Senator seems to key-in immediately on Kelly\u2019s almost worshipful view of him and he seeks her affections in return. The sexual tension between them is palpable in this passage, as Oates rhythmically writes: \u201csuch intimacy, together in the bouncing jolting car\u201d (line 3). And yet there is a clear undertone of disgust that begins to emerge as well in this passage, serving as an ominous and foreboding sign: Kelly recalls the Senator boldly approaching her earlier in the day and stealing a kiss: \u201cbeery kisses, that tongue thick enough to choke you\u201d (line 4). That he feels he can approach her and kiss her aggressively so early in their relationship, practically \u201cchoking\u201d her in the process, again suggests the presence of a power imbalance. Oates also uses the visual imagery of the Senator\u2019s \u201cthick\u201d tongue as an analogy for his masculinity. It is his masculine desire to sleep with Kelly \u2013 driving recklessly in part to accomplish this goal \u2013 that leads to Kelly actually \u201cchoking\u201d to death. This particular sentence fragment also represents a shift in dramatic structure, as Kelly and the Senator\u2019s flirtatious and exciting initial relationship now has the markings of a more adversarial and ugly one.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The power imbalance between Kelly and the Senator is also present in the descriptions Oates applies to the Senator. These descriptions sound editorial, as if they might appear in newspaper clippings, and they also clearly help to form the images Kelly has of the Senator in her own mind. Oates writes, \u201chere was one of the immune, beside her: he, one of the powerful adults of the world, manly man\u201d (line 5). Oates also writes, \u201cU.S. Senator, a famous face and a tangled history, empowered to not merely endure history but to guide it, control it, manipulate it to his own ends\u201d (lines 6 and 7). In describing the Senator as a \u201cmanly man\u201d with a \u201cfamous face,\u201d Oates uses powerful consonant word pairings to underscore the elevated view Kelly has of the Senator. Because they are also mingled with a journalistic writing style, there is an implication that the media has influenced Kelly\u2019s lofty view of the man and hence her decision to be with him that evening. In these sentences, Oates details more cracks in the Senator\u2019s persona and Kelly\u2019s view of him when Oates uses words like \u201ctangled,\u201d \u201ccontrol,\u201d and \u201cmanipulate.\u201d When Oates describes the Senator as \u201cone of the immune,\u201d she paints a picture of what will come: he will survive, and probably even continue to thrive, while Kelly\u2019s death is nearly a foregone conclusion. This \u201cimmune\u201d man sits \u201cbeside\u201d Kelly, again delineating their two very different positions, both literally and figuratively.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Senator represents both the stereotypical powerful and older man and the stereotypical politician. He is handsome (and of course tall!), but fraying a bit around the edges in his older age. He is confident and accustomed to being the center of attention. In these ways, he is quite the opposite of Kelly, again underscoring their uneven positions. Oates describes the Senator using a journalistic and somewhat poetic style as \u201c\u2026an old-style liberal Democrat out of the 1960\u2019s, a Great Society man with a stubborn and zealous dedication to social reform seemingly not embittered or broken or even greatly surprised at the opposition his humanitarian ideas aroused in the America of the waning years of the twentieth century\u2026\u201d (lines 7, 8, 9 and 10). The Senator, while appearing to be a man who fights for the rights of the underprivileged, is later revealed as a typical hypocritical politician. This is made obvious by his decision to kick Kelly to save himself from the sinking automobile, thinking only of his reputation and making no attempt to save Kelly\u2019s life. Again Oates uses the word \u201cseemingly\u201d deliberately, emphasizing how little we know of the Senator\u2019s underbelly relative to his \u201chumanitarian\u201d public image. Oates also uses the words \u201cstubborn\u201d and \u201czealous\u201d in a positive sentence, and yet these words still have their negative connotations.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Kelly allows herself to drive with the drunken Senator. Oates notes the \u201cgiddy smell of alcohol pungent between them\u201d in the car (lines 3 and 4). Kelly has observed the Senator drinking excessively throughout the day, and even agrees to carry a spare drink for him on their doomed drive. She isn\u2019t a stupid woman. In fact, she is rather smart. Yet she succumbs to his wishes and agrees to leave with him because she knows that this is a man who is accustomed to getting his way, and if she doesn\u2019t oblige, she won\u2019t see him again. This dynamic again emphasizes the power imbalance between them and the Senator\u2019s exploitation of that imbalance. Kelly is also foolishly influenced by her horoscope (of all things!), which said, \u201cToo much caution in revealing your impulses and desires to others! For once demand YOUR wishes and get YOUR own way! Your stars are wildly romantic now, Scorpio, after a period of disappointment \u2013 GO FOR IT!\u201d (Page 13). The behavior of Kelly\u2019s friend, who is dating an older male friend of the Senator and has an overt sexual confidence that Kelly envies, also influences her decisions. Kelly succumbs to these outside influences and her unfortunate choice to ignore her own better instincts eventually leads to her death.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Patience Stone , by Atiq Rahimi, shares much in common with Black Water , although it is set in Afghanistan in the midst of a civil war rather than in peaceful and idyllic Maine at the turn of the 21st century. Like Oates, Rahimi explores the theme of power imbalances between men and women and the weighty influence of social norms, although in this case it is not the media or the behavior of a friend, but rather religion, which serves as the focal point. The Patience Stone is set inside a single room in which the unnamed woman\u2019s husband (who is also nameless) lies dying, having been shot during a silly dispute with another jihadist. This \u2018single-space\u2019 approach is similar to Black Water , which takes place inside a single sinking automobile. Both stories also feature female leads whose memories, which span multiple years and settings, form the basis for the storyline.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the troubling passage above from The Patience Stone , the unnamed female lead has just been raped by a young male soldier, who mistakes her for a prostitute. Rahimi relays the woman\u2019s utter sadness and shame in short, rhythmic, emotive and visually stirring sentences: \u201cher eyes fill with tears. Her body huddles up. She wraps her arms around her knees, tucks in her head and wails. A single, heartbreaking wail\u201d (lines 2 and 3). The visual image Rahimi portrays of the woman in these few words is almost animalistic; this is fitting given how the woman has been treated not only by the young man who has just raped her, but also by her husband and her father, among others (including her mother-in-law). As Rahimi details throughout the novel, these men have used religion as an excuse to treat women as subhuman, as animals.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The reader comes to learn, however, that the female protagonist in The Patience Stone is not the stereotypical oppressed Muslim woman often portrayed in the western world. Such a portrayal would be far too simple. She is, instead, subject to intense oppression, and yet she also manages to secretly wrench control of her own life in several circumstances. When her husband proves to be barren and yet she faces the blame for their childless marriage and risks being cast aside, she finds another man to impregnate her \u2013 not once, but twice. When her father sells her sister in exchange for gambling debts brought on by quail fighting, she kills his quail. When her husband takes advantage of her while she is (pretending) to be asleep, and then beats her when he discovers that he is covered in her \u201cimpure\u201d blood, the woman later retorts by taking advantage of him while he is unconscious and dying. After she has been raped, the woman turns the horrible event into an opportunity to earn money. She later laughs at the young man who raped her when he returns to see her, belittling him, only to discover that he too has been abused. She actually feels sorry for the young man when he is embarrassed by his weak sexual performance. We learn these secrets, and the complexity of this woman, as she talks to her husband and lives in his presence, while he lays in bed unable to respond and seemingly unconscious. The woman feels a tremendous weight lifted from her shoulders as these secrets unravel. Thus she refers to her husband as her \u201csang-e saboor,\u201d or the patience stone that absorbs the worries of those who confide in it.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A critical turning point occurs in the above passage: \u201cA breeze flutters, as if in response to her cry, lifting the curtains to let the gray fog flood the room. The woman raises her head. Slowly. She does not stand. She still doesn\u2019t raise her eyes to the green curtain. She doesn\u2019t dare. She stares down at the crumpled notes scattering in the breeze\u201d (lines 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). In these short utterances, Rahimi appears to use symbolism and personification to invoke the presence of God flooding the room in the form of a \u201cgray fog.\u201d But this isn\u2019t the God the woman has come to know as a cause of her oppression. This is a God who is revealing a new opportunity to the woman, a chance to earn an income and to again wrench back some semblance of control. The woman regains her humanity as she \u201craises her head. Slowly.\u201d She is still afraid of her husband, who has come to be represented by the \u201cgreen curtain\u201d behind which she has hidden him. After this juncture, however, the woman \u201cReappears. Dressed in green and white. Looking more serene\u201d (line 11). Green is commonly used in literature and art to symbolize the earth, and thus life and growth, as well as the colors of Islam and therefore immortality. While the husband is cloaked behind a \u201cgreen curtain,\u201d the woman has been reborn in this scene, unable to be kept down, and she appears \u201cserene\u201d as a result.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the woman unburdens herself of her secrets, she hopes that her husband has come to understand her better, the errors of his ways and the great weight of the oppression to which she has been subject under their religious and societal norms. Unbeknownst to the woman, her husband has heard all of her confessions and her actions. He arises, as if from the dead, and proceeds to kill her. Even as her husband murders her, the woman appears to find some serenity in the unburdening of her secrets and her thoughts as her soul, symbolized by the migrating birds on the curtains, flies away.\u00a0       Everything you learned in Close Textual Analysis I about connotative language must be applied to analysis of the story, narrative voice and sequencing, and dramatic structure so that the form and content are one aesthetic whole.       \u00a0       Story is what happens to a specific person or group of people in a specific place at a specific time.             Dramatic structure is the orchestration of conflict in the story, exaggerated or edited to produce an exciting fight (mental, physical or spiritual) between protagonist(s) and antagonists. In the classical model, this conflict is related to a central dramatic question, objectives, obstacles and plot points characterized by catalyst, commitment, confrontation, chaos/low point, crisis, climax and conclusion. We will also study the Ordinary World/Special World Journey created by Joseph Campbell. Some modernist and postmodernist writers create their own dramatic structure or improvise and ignore it.       Narrative structure is the way the events are sequenced in time and space from the point of view of the narrator in a book and/or camera in a film in such a way that a style is created that expounds the theme , or the way the author feels about the material. In novels and short stories, the narrator or narrators tell the tale in the first or third person, singular and/or plural, and rarely in the second person. In film the narrator can be a real person who occasionally narrates over the action, or simply the POV of the camera.       For example, the CDQ in Pulp Fiction may be \u201cHow will the crime unfold among Vince, Jules, Butch etc., but the two themes are \u201cCrime works if you can keep it a secret\u201d within the chronology of events, or \u201cIt is possible to get out of crime with a spiritual transformation\u201d based on the focus on Jules' epiphany at the conclusion in the way it is filmed. The story of Pulp Fiction is a mundane one of murder and double-dealing throughout three days with drug dealers; but the narrative structure of the stop action, rewind and fast-forward of a VCR turns the story into a dramatic structure with multiple protagonists where a character with little screen time has the character transformation that restructures the story into both an Aristotelian structure with three crises/climaxes, or a monomyth where Jules emerges from the special world to have a transformation. Don't worry if you don't understand all this right away, as it is covered thoroughly\u00a0the course.       \u00a0             In Romeo and Juliet, the story is about these young lovers from the warring Capulet and Montague families; the CDQ is &quot;Will they get married and live happily ever after or not?&quot; and the theme is &quot;True love never runs smoothly,&quot; refering to Shakespeare's attitude toward the material,\u00a0so that the sequencing of events lead to the tragic, untimely deaths of the lovers. \u00a0                   DRAMATIC STRUCTURE         Timed Paradigm modeled on 120 page or 120 minute script  For each plot point, describe exactly what your two protagonists (is that what you want--two journeys?) are doing, what they want, and what obstacles they face. After each plot point, state and refine your CDQ or Central Dramatic Question. If you have two protagonists, you will need 4 graphs of time and space for each one. Make sure all these plot points are actions that can be filmed. Conversations can ensue, images can be symbolic, but create a clear dramatic event that inspires the CDQ.    Set-up  Catalyst or Instigating Event or Inciting Incident 5-15 minutes into film depending on genre. A murder mystery might have the catalyst as credits roll. State CDQ.    Commitment or Plot Point One 30 minutes into film. How has the CDQ become more focused?    Confrontation Mid Point 60 minutes into film\u00a0 This must involve a significant fight with the antagonistic forces. How has the CDQ changed?       Chaos Plot Point Two. The Low Point. p.90. Make us think that all is lost. What has happened to the CDQ? Where are protagonist and antagonist? What is the worst thing that could happen?             Crisis around 105 to 110. Tease the audience with a crisis before the climax. Up the stakes and put the audience on the edge of their seats.         Climax around 110-115. What is the most dramatic thing you can think of? Is this a true catharsis?         Conclusion to 120. Did you answer the CDQ, twist it in a new way, or move to another CDQ?         Obviously there are excellent &quot;slice-of-life&quot; screenplays shot by French or independent directors. However, you are not a director so I recommend that your script have a clearer structure and the more complex it is, the harder you must work on its structure--just like the layers of Adobe Photoshop. To be experimental one must be even more organized.         Space Paradigm inspired by Joseph Campbell but using the work of Chris Vogler and Stuart Voytilla to adapt it to the screen       For this paradigm, list the ARCHETYPAL roles of all characters such as the Hero, or Heroine, Shadow, Threshold Guardian, Trickster, Mentor, Allies, Friends etc. This journey can be symbolic and internal but you still visual images to symbolize the deeper layers.         ORDINARY WORLD In your outline under OW, you are actually talking about the Special World. Really set up an ordinary world with which the audience can identify. Imagine its colors and shapes so that you can also imagine how the Special World differs. Think of films like Blue Velvet that moved from the mundane suburbs to a hallucinatory drug world.         CROSSING THE THRESHOLD is usually around PP1 about 30 pages. Who are the guardians and how do the Hero and Heroine get through?       TESTS with Allies and Enemies       APPROACH THE INMOST CAVE is usually around mid-point, 60 pages in\u00a0 but not necessarily. You have to follow the space in this paradigm. Where is the scariest place and how does the Hero emerge?       What is the REWARD?         CROSSING THE RETURN THRESHOLD back to the ORDINARY WORLD       ELIXIR What did the hero learn from the journey?       RESURRECTION How has he changed?         (I wrote a script where the heroine returned to an EXTRAORDINARY WORLD but it is simpler to follow the paradigm.)         Once you have the two paradigms for one or several protagonists you and your readers (producers and agents) have a clearer idea of dramatic structure. Then you can decide what sequencing techniques to use such a flashback recursive, tandem-competitive, split screen etc based on Aronson's book. The movie Pulp Fiction has a very simply story with a 3-day timeline, a fairly simple dramatic structure, but a complex sequencing inspired by the rewind, fast forward of the VCR age. Now we can be even more complex but if your dramatic structure isn't clear then you come off as disorganized when you do innovative sequencing.         Sequencing is akin to ordering the different courses of a meal you have already cooked with dramatic structure. Do you want the French cuisine with small bits at a time in a predictable order, a Jewish wedding buffet, an Asian sushi style presentation or what? Then eating the meal is what your characters do with scene study based on the exact LANGUAGE you have.                                   Campbell Monomyth: Paradigm of Space                                               Look at your entire script in terms of a spatial journey of the hero or heroine from the Ordinary to the Special and back to the Ordinary World.                                         Timed Plot Points: A Paradigm of Time                                               When you cook a meal you usually are aware of the time it takes to boil, bake, fry, or broil the food. Time is an essential element of drama.                                         Dramatic Structure and Cooking                                               -        Steam-the Aristotelian pressure cooker        When you steam food, you preserve the texture and vitamins, but you make it really hot. If you steam too long, it will wilt or get soggy; if you don't steam enough, part of it remains cold. Coffee benefits from the steaming process and sometimes makes us think more        sharply.               Drama began from our love and need for imitation, harmony and        rhythm. Tragedy is an imitation of characters of noble birth and comedy of        inferior types whose flaws are so exaggerated and real that we can laugh at        them. Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete and of a        certain magnitude, in language embellished with each kind of ornament, through        pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of the audience's emotions.Pity is        aroused by unmerited misfortune; fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves.        Every tragedy must have six parts: Plot, Character, Diction, Thought, Spectacle,        Song. Aristotle feels plot is more important than character because the most        beautiful colors, laid on confusedly, will not give as much pleasure as the        chalk outline of a portrait. Do you agree? Spectacle is the least important.        Diction involves the delivery of words that are either current, or strange, or        metaphorical, or ornamental, or newly-coined, or lengthened, or contracted, or        altered. The perfection of style is to be clear without being mean or too        literal, vulgar, simplistic etc.               Aristotle disliked episodic drama: for tragedy to be worthwhile it          had to be a well constructed story with a beginning, middle and end that          proceeded from action to counteraction by necessity and probability. There is a          strong connection between what he wanted from drama and what he wanted from        rhetoric, although the purpose of tragedy is to purge the emotions. Tragedy must          be simpler and more credible than comedy if it is to move us to tears rather          than laugher. A simple plot is one which takes place without reversal or        recognition. A complex plot has reversals and recognitions which should arise          from the internal structure. The best form of recognition is coincident with          reversal, as in OEDIPUS. Characters must be chosen in such a way that their          actions raise the stakes of the drama. It's better to have family members kill          each other than an enemy kill an enemy because then you can construct scenes          that have the elements of betrayal, jealousy, fear, love etc. as well as anger.      The DEUS EX MACHINA must only be employed for events external to the drama; the       crisis/climax should arise of necessity from the inciting incident, just the way      it's supposed to do in Hollywood screenplays. Every tragedy falls into two      parts: complication and unravelling. Complication is every action that moves to      the turning-point from good to bad fortune and unravelling is that which extends        from the beginning of the change to the end.               An epic structure differs from a tragedy because it has a multiplicity of plots. Epic structure is similar to what we call narrative structure. However as poetry (Homer) it was usually written in the heroic measure. Alexander Pope satirized this form in his mock epic poem THE RAPE OF          THE LOCK in the eighteenth century. Epic tales can be longer, more complicated,          more irrational and fantastical because they are not confined to the stage.               In Western drama the most important thing is a hero who badly wants something        he can't get; in world mythology, it is the call to adventure to undertake a        journey, implying that there are archetypal forces even stronger than the hero's        objective. The first is a paradigm of time, heightened by compressing events in        space into a limited time span; while the second is a paradigm of space that        takes the hero away from the Ordinary World to transform enough in the Special        World so he can bring back an elixir to community. Return, resurrection, rescue,        archetypes, threshold struggle are some of the terms pitted against plot points,        throughlines, premises, reversals, crisis/climax/denouement. While high concept        screenplays involve the community and transformative dramas develop character        transformation, in the Campbell paradigm, the hero's transformation is a        resurrection that brings the community full circle. Campbell's work is motivated        by his spiritual search and his recording of stories that transcend the hero's objective to connect to a more universal truth. Many Western stories stay with        the self, its foibles, flaws, frustrations, and final triumph in getting what it        wants.               The French dramatist, Georges Polti, categorized 36 dramatic situations, that        presumably encompass all the major conflicts between characters in drama. If you        are basing your story on real life, and want to raise the stakes, you can use        one or more of these situations to cook your characters.        Supplication        Crime Pursued by Vengeance        Vengeance Taken for Kindred upon Kindred        Pursuit        Disaster        Falling Prey to Cruelty or Misfortune        Revolt        Daring Enterprise        Abduction|        The Enigma        Obtaining        Enmity of Kinsmen        Rivalry of Kinsmen        Murderous Adultery        Madness        Fatal Imprudence        Involuntary Crimes of Love        Slaying of a Kinsman Unrecognized        Self-sacrificing for an Ideal        Self-sacrifice for Kindred        All Sacrificed for a Passion        Necessity of Sacrificing Loved Ones        Rivalry of Superior and Inferior        Adultery        Crimes of Love        Discovery of the Dishonor of a Loved One        Obstacles to Love        An Enemy Loved        Ambition        Conflict with a God        Mistaken Jealousy        Erroneous Judgment        Remorse        Recovery of a Lost One        Loss of Loved Ones                             Dramatic structure, how the conflict unfolds, is not the same as narrative        structure, the sequence of events in time and space colored by the POV of the        narrator. Dramatic structure is the conflict between protagonist and antagonists        as they fight for their through-lines in response to the Central Dramatic        Question, a visual paradigm similar to falling off a cliff from catalyst to        commitment to confrontation to cataclysm to chaos, crisis, climax and        conclusion, timed by plot points. Emotion is consummated in a catharsis.        Americans still find Aristotle useful now for his catharsis and definition of        unities of space, time and action and priorities of plot, character, thought,        diction, song, spectacle. Shakespeare is good for the gap between expectations        and result, colored by the character's dilemma and necessity to choose, a        sequence of choices, which reveals deep character. While Americans can't compete        with Shakespeare's language, nor do they want to, they have the same epic sense        of crisis and climax and its effect on the community. However, they tend to        prefer transformational drama to a tragedy where the hero dies. The hero is        often a commoner who makes good rather than an aristocrat who falls, reinforcing        the democratic social system of American culture.               While the plot points are a paradigm mainly of time, the monomyth is a        paradigm of space. The circular journey from ordinary to special world and back        and the stages of this journey from call to adventure, to crossing the        threshold, approaching the inmost cave, returning resurrected and getting or        giving the elixir are similar to plot points except that the spatial aspects        represent a circle rather than falling off a cliff, thereby making the set-up        and conclusion a bit longer.               Just like argumentation, drama deals with controversy, conflict and        conversion in a search for truth except that logical fallacies are glorified to        heighten the flaws of the tragic or comic characters. Drama must combust space        and time so deadlines, planting and payoff are necessary to heighten surprise        and mystery, while irony can enhance suspense and make the audience feel smart.        No matter how intricate and discipline the dramatic structure, if the emotions        of pity, fear, laughter or lust are not elicited in the audience, then the        structure will be more like a legal case than a drama that requires catharsis to        transcend the paradigms, just as wonder must transcend prosody in poetry.               World of Time: Plot Points and the Central Dramatic Question-Catalyst,        Commitment, Confrontation, Chaos, Crisis, Climax, Conclusion               World of Space: Campbell Paradigm, Ordinary and Special Worlds, Bore-dinary        and Extraordinary, Call to Adventure, Crossing Thresholds, Meeting with the        Mentor, Approach the Inmost Cave, Reward, Resurrection, Elixir        \u00a0               In summary, cooking transforms your food, as conflict transforms your characters. You decide whether to steam, fry, broil, boil, bake, saute, or serve them raw and bleeding. You also cook, dice, or prepare the fruits, vegetables,        starches, and drinks in your meal. Cooking compresses time in space, which is        what drama does to your action. No matter what, you still have to serve        delicious, appetizing food, so you can't undercook or overcook your characters.               Characterization        Most of you are naturally good at characterization, at discovering, hiding, or uncovering the secrets, lies, obstacles, and wishes that confound and cause action. You are also good at seeing people's qualities and flaws. Therefore you should focus on creating characters in conflict playing out your dramatic structure and acting in scenes with specific activities (stage business) that relate to their overall actions and throughlines. In other words, characters must be firmly embedded in your script.                Good drama gives the audience a taste of death. Even comedy has a taste of         some kind of death. Death helps the audience appreciate life more and fear their         own demise less. To keep the story going for 2 hours, make sure you tease the         audience with appearances of death and take them on a treacherous roller coaster         ride.                 Make sure you relate each character to the Campbell archetypes. While the hero undergoes a momentous transformation as a result of this journey, the other characters serve as archetypes to further this journey, and must fulfill roles such as MENTOR(wise old person offering gifts, motivation, inspiration, guidance, training), THRESHOLD GUARDIAN (obstacle at the gateway to the new world), HERALD (issues challenges and announces the coming of         significant change), SHAPESHIFTER (the protean force that creates surprise,         suspense, obstacles and keeps the audience and the hero guessing, the animus/a         of the hero), SHADOW (the dark side of self but also the villain), TRICKSTER         (challenges authority through laughter, helps hero and audience see the truth by         laughing at it), and of course the hero's HIGHER SELF, in true 12 step fashion.         These types can change masks the way the shapeshifter does, but on the deepest         level, and Hollywood is trying to get &quot;deeper&quot; in the twenty first century, they         represent parts of the buried psyche of the hero. Hence any journey is         ultimately a journey inward as the villains are projections from the hero's id.                 The HERO must elicit empathy/sympathy in the audience so they are willing to         immerse themselves in his journey; he must have human flaws, needs, desires and         capacity for growth-- rather, an almost inhuman capacity for growth because it         has to happen in less than 2 hours. He should be fully active, decisive, capable         of SACRIFICE for his ideals. In this way he shows us how to deal with death,         whether it is literal death or death of a loved one, an idea, a part of oneself.         A hero can journey from the ordinary to the special world and back or from the         wilderness to civilisation and back or anywhere and back as long as something is         learned. This means that Hollywood may be ready to start accepting tragedy as a         genre (especially after 9/11) as long as the hero learns something and the         community is restored and made whole in some way.         Notice how phallic this entire journey is, particularly with the approach to         the inmost cave, passing through the &quot;belly of the whale,&quot; as Campbell would         say. If women were truly free to create their journey, how would it differ?         (Dancing with Wolves?) Maybe the climax is not going into the secret cave but         rather dancing with a wolf and beating him. Maybe it is similar to what I felt         when I was wriestling men and had to win every time as part of the choreography.         Maybe it is moving into a larger space where the light is brighter and the         mountains are higher.         In the pits of the cave, in the muddy, murky miasma of anima, the hero faces         an elusive, ephemeral death. But in the open the heroine battles the strong,         powerful male villain by dancing with him.         At the end of the male journey, there is an apotheosis, a step up from         enthusiasm where the hero becomes god by letting go of his ego. Men like to go         on adventures and come back to the hearth. Women might stay at the hearth but         for those who go on adventures, what are their journeys like? Are there two         kinds of women?         Stuart Voytilla in Myth and the Movies analyzes films in terms of         Vogler's and Campbell's structures and divides genre differently from Dancyger,         in this order: Action Adventure, Western, Horror with Silence of the Lambs here,         Thriller, War, Drama, Romance, Romantic Comedy, Comedy, Sci Fi/Fantasy. What roles do your characters play in terms of genre?                 As I have said many times, drama is related to sex, defecation, injestion,         digestion, birth, death, foreplay, orgasms, fight-- hormones and physical         states. The Campbell Vogler journey is phallic-- a trip to the cave and back.         Women might go to waterfalls to be showered with the sperm of life. They run         with wolves, embrace their anima, or fight animals.         A thriller must be an intriguing puzzle, something to keep the audience         mentally alert, and on the edge of their seats. It would be hard for me to write         a good thriller-- it\u00a0is logical/math, clean, mean, tightly structured, highly         focused.         Hollywood is slowly beginning to embrace the tragedy and now America is         ready, after 9/11. The hero of INSOMNIA dies and the female prodigy takes over.         America has also made satire popular since the war on Iraq.         Shakespeare's tragedies are not completely tragic because they overthrow a         monarch and expose his faults, something many people would want to do,         consciously or unconsciously. We don't have monarchs. WAG THE DOG made fun of         the president but we don't venerate the leader the way other cultures did. Our         leader is our court jester in that movie. The American story is the little guy         makes good-- the Rocky myth-- and that is also an immigrant's story, but now         America is ready for other myths and Hollywood is greedy to maintain its         hegemony on the global storytelling market.                 \u00a0         Is your heroine empathic and sympathetic and to which audience?                 By comparing characters to food, we determine how they were found, gathered,         or killed from the story, how they will be cooked or prepared in the dramatic         structure, how they will be sequenced in time and space or displayed on the         dinner table, how they will be eaten, digested, eliminated, and metabolized by         the audience or reader. So characters as food relate directly to story         structure, genre, and audience. But there are other ways of comparing them.         Objects, Musical Instruments, Animals : Act, Hear and Feel                  Food analogies aren't the only ways to create, develop, and orchestrate your         characters. By comparing them to household appliances, you get a clear idea of         how they act in a situation. A scissor personality is different from a vacuum         cleaner,a broom, a washing machine, or a toilet bowl cleaner. Once you see how your characters         clean up you may be better able to predict their actions in a scene.         Not everyone speaks the same way.         Resonance, pitch, timbre, phrasing and vocabulary distinguish each character so a useful exercise is to assign a musical instrument to each character's voice. A melodious harp plays differently         on our ears and psyches than a relentless drum, a schreechy violin, an ethereal         flute, a banging piano, a twanging guitar, or a new age synthesizer.         Every time you create dialogue, hear the sounds of these distinct instruments         and let your characters respond accordingly.         In drama, we want our characters to feel instinctively and act with power.         Therefore, if you assign an animal to each character, you will know how they fight, eat, have sex, and escape. A snake curls up lasciviously on the rock in the sun but will stand up, hiss, and         bite if attacked; a mosquito is almost invisible until it delivers its itchy bite; a fish swims fluidly, seeking food everywhere, even on the end of a lethal hook; the gentle, slow-moving         elephant can crush life with a single ponderous step; the gazelle is beautifulto look at, but if you approach, it will run away with lightning speed. The wormy caterpillar metamorphoses         into a beautiful butterfly.The lizard blends into its environment.Your pet cat can be dressed up for Halloween. Before you write a scene, assemble your characters, know what food, object,         instrument, and animal they are, understand the plot objectives of the scene,         but let the characters surprise, based on their essences. Serials, soaps and sitcoms have the same characters returning every day, changing superficially and reacting in somewhat predictable patterns.         Archetypes are classic character types such as the Shadow, the Hero, the         Shapeshifter, the Mentor, whose essence is related to the role they play in the         dramatic journey.                 Stereotypes are contemporary character types flattened and exaggerated to fit         a socially identifiable role. They work best in satire, slapstick, or to provide         comic relief in tragedy. If the hero of your transformational drama is a         stereotype, you are in trouble.         Three-Dimensional Characters         Height, width and volume? This is a crazy         nomenclature but what it means is that characters have dimensions and depth;         they break stereotypes, they often act unpredictably, they have many sides to         their personality, they have secrets that they hide or lie about, and they         change as the story unfolds. A main character may have a kaleidoscopic         personality, sounding like a violin in one scene, or a harp in the next, acting         like scissors with a girlfriend, but a vacuum cleaner with his professor.         Relationships         In drama, the character is only as good as         its relationship to others and to the plot. Food can't be digested without water         within and without, therefore, you must examine your characters for their         strengths, weaknesses, needs, desires, and objectives that will force them to         fit themselves into others like a jigsaw puzzle. As a liquid, water is different         from wine or coffee.         Transformation is\u00a0 how characters are transformed by the dramatic structure of the work, the way meat is cooked in the oven. The protagonist is usually the character who is cooked         the most.         Objectives         In real life we may have many objectives or         goals, some which may never be fulfilled. Sometimes we get so disappointed we         stop fighting and just roll with the punches or submit to the blowing wind with         faith or que sera sera. Therefore it may seem unnatural to sustain a         protagonist's or antagonist's single objective relentlessly through an entire         story. In real life many believe more in destiny, luck chance or God than in the         power of individual will. We can be responsible for the small things, the daily         tasks, but at any moment we can get sick, or be subject to an earthquake,         hurricane, fire or whatever. These deus ex machina events don't always create         the best drama. In real life there are very few devils or angels. Most people         are a mixture of the two, capable of evil and good, and the most self-righteous         people can usually do the most harm.         Some people do evil because their brains are so brilliant they explode and go         haywire; others because they dissociate and can't imagine, killing as if a game         from a distance enjoying the power and control like Richard III; some people         like the sexuality of killing and become addicted to that; some people are         fascinated with death and want to martyr themselves. Some people are sorry for         what they did, some don't feel what they did was wrong, and some are happy to be         branded evil. Satan was discharged from heaven when he disobeyed. He was one of         the angels, as righteous as any.         Throughline: Macbeth wants so badly to be king he is willing to murder to get         it. Jan wants so badly to be with Jalal she is willing to pursue him to outer         space. Jalal wants so badly to be with Jan that he compromises his jihadhi plot.                 The problem with writing is that we can subconsciously put ourselves in the         protagonist's position and create a wish fulfillment scenario that would make us         reluctant to make things hard for our characters, to maim or kill them, to grind         them against each other. We live in an ideal world that needs conflict so what         to do? I could do the elevator irritation exercise. Take each character and lock         them in an elevator with another for an indefinite period of time. Then make         hellish triangles of lethal combos. Screenwriting is the tip of the iceberg, but         good readers know whether or not there is an iceberg or just a floating piece of         ice.         Story isn't the same as structure.         To milk a scene or live in the moment is so different from planning a       structure. You must let the moment take you where you don't want to go. You can         always revise a structure. The unfolding of a drama is a striptease: if you just         pull all your clothes off at once, you eliminate suspense, mystery, and the         ability to tease the audience, to prolong their final satisfaction. Narrative,         story and structure are different things.         As with research papers, writers are not able to ask enough irritating         questions early in the process regarding motivations, objectives, interactions,         conflicts, results. Writing is problem solving but one must challenge oneself         with tough problems in the beginning. We like to be optimistic, superficial,         cheerful, avoid conflict in favor of peace in many of our daily interactions,         but to create drama we have to twist every situation the way Socrates would to         see if it is the best. If the story is personal, we may want to have the         antagonist or the chief ally become the protagonist so that we don't just         project our victimization.

Americans want         their characters to get better, not older and weaker as they do in real life.         They have a puritan need to learn something from the story to make their own         lives better-- how to give up an addiction, fight an external or internal enemy         and win, get a better job, resolve their relationship problems. But in real life         the law of entropy usually has people getting older, fatter, weaker, losing         their minds and their bank accounts, their dignity and their hopes. In Cairo         Trilogy characters peak with their marriages and births or even martyrdoms but         very few people have the pollyanna triumphs of American cinema.         Americans like realism but not depressing naturalism. They like to leave the         cinema or put the book down with renewed energy and hope to conquer their own         troubles. They also like to be entertained and while they expect these moral         lessons embedded in their stories they don't want to work too hard to learn         things. They read or watch primarily for the twists and turns of the story, the         amusing or heart-wrenching actions of the characters, the sex and violence that         keeps things moving. I read novels from other cultures and historical periods to         learn about them but these are rarely popular.         The Cairo Trilogy is depressing to Americans but hopeful to Arabs because it         reaffirms the repetitious cycle of family life and the omnipotent unity of         Allah. Individuals don't need the triumphs necessary in Western literature.         Different cultures require different levels of conflict, honesty, politeness         and vulgarity. Americans may be disgusted by the two-faced behavior of Ahmad in         Cairo Trilogy, the stern patriarch who rules his family like a tyrant and the         drunk philanderer who is the life of the party. However Arabs may be disgusted         by the outspoken, in-your-face Americans who tell it like it is spitting out         Protein-the main meat, amino acids, making muscle-is muscle         the objective or throughline?         Protagonists are the protein--they build muscle, repair tissue, require lots         of water to digest, and have the most long lasting effects on the audience's         metabolism.Proteins can be meat, fish,nuts, legumes, or dairy         products.         If your main character is modeled on milk,how would that differ from a steak protagonist?         Carbohydrates-society-powers that be-antagonists?         Junk food is the antagonist because it slowly poisons us.               THE GAP: You can fix a lot of writing that has a bad overall         structure by working on the gap between expectations and result, where the         characters harbor conflicting objectives, needs from the people in the scene so         they don't talk at each other, secrets that must cover up with lies in order to         flatter, persuade and cajole. Then there is the relative knowledge of the         audience so that mystery, suspense and surprise are created through the gap.         Interaction and Dialogue         While the following may be okay in some instances, they cannot substitute for         drama: 1) Sounding off: So much of our daily interaction is lyrical or bitching         about life, our problems, worrying about what we should or shouldn't do,         reliving guilt from the past with another person in such a way that we are not         always conscious of what we want from that person, if anything. This can waste         time in a novel or screenplay although it can reveal character if used as         motivations for objectives and actions. Memoirs are full of these lyrical         laments. It's fine in poetry when cased in beautiful language but it can get         really tedious if allowed to stalemate a story. 2) Exposition: explaining what         already happened either with a character or the narrator. Some of this is         necessary but it can't take over the scene. 3)Utilitarian intercourse: which         means the mundanity of daily interaction--greeting, shopping, going to the bank,         driving the car, taking the subway. My students tend to have entire scenes just         going to a bar or waking up in the morning. It's okay to start in these         locations with these interactions but the characters must get into a dramatic         situation and the narrator or camera must develop a real story. 4) Gratuitous         violence: another easy way out is to have someone shot without a sufficiently         dramatic situation or to have warlike actions without the emotional conflict,         unless a satire is being developed. To milk the present drama must be created:         two or more characters want conflicting things from each other, related to their         throughlines. In real life we often avoid these situations or get out of them         when they occur, as they are uncomfortable.         \u00a0Nutritional Balance         Character Orchestration         Everyone can't be a star, nor have the same will, energy, voice,         body, and commitment. If you only eat protein, you will get kidney disease; if         you only eat sugar, diabetes. Audiences require nutritional balance--all kinds         of interesting characters, but a hierarchy where the protagonist and the chief         antagonist take up most of the story. You don't have to cook fruits and         vegetables as long as meat. Bread bakes for a long time, but at a relatively low         temperature.\u00a0                                                                              Theme and Sequencing                                                                      While dramatic structure relates to central dramatic question, narrative          structure relates to theme, the author's attitude towards the material.          Narrative structure is described by the voice of the narrator-omniscient,          limited, first or third person, non-human, personified or human, distance from          the story; the sequence of events in time-linear, recursive or other kinds of          flashback, superimposed time or tandem competitive, past imperfect or          repetition, out of time in some kinds of expository, lyrical or descriptive          writing which may include the emotional subjunctive, conditional or future time          expressed in the possibilities of branching narratives and indeterminate          endings; and a spatial existence that can be real, imaginary, in the head,          superimposed space or disembodied.                   What are the unique qualities of print, oral communication, internet/small screen, or movies/big screen that create certain kinds of narrative and dramatic structures? Dramatic structures are the          same in all media but narrative structures differ. The Internet is most          conducive to branching narratives, tandem competitive time and superimposed          space. How do written and oral communication differ? Written communication lends          itself to the invisible, omniscient narrator but oral communication insists on          the real character of the narrator as in Arabian Nights . Film has          glorified the flashback and recursive narrative but branching narratives with          indeterminate future are not popular. Run Lola Run is more of a rewind          of three stories from beginning to end, rather than a future oriented piece.          Film can speed up or slow down but it lives in the immediate present even when          flashing back.                   There are many kinds of sequencing already used in contemporary films but more that haven't even been dreamed of. For a discussion of all elements of Flashback sequencing, consult Aronson's book. Here are a few kinds of sequencing I have used in various projects:          RECURSIVE: The present is relatively static and the past is used to solve a          problem in the present, even if that is to recapture lost time as in Proust, or          to stop the plague in Ancient Greece in Oedipus Rex . While the climax of the          play occurs when Oedipus plucks out his eyes, the present action up until then          has been mainly conversation about dramatic events in the past. When the past is          plucked, it is not replayed in a realistic, linear fashion, but filtered through          the lens of the present. At the end the digs into the past cause the present to          change somewhat. This is often told in first person or through the eyes of a          main character. Flashback films and written memoirs, static plays like Oedipus          are its forms. How do these forms differ and how do they translate into each          other? Recursive is the basis of psychoanalysis where patient and psychiatrist          sit in a static present using events in the past to trigger feelings to be          catharsized and analyzed in order to solve problems for better action in the          future. Oedipus Rex only won second prize in the playwriting competition in          Ancient Greece, so some feel this kind of storytelling isn't dramatic enough.          This is the basis of reflection, of the thinking we do in memoirs or at the end          of the day. But it doesn't work well with multiple narrators or a huge          sociological vision or a lot of action. It is for sensory recall, problem          solving.          Thwarted dream, case history, life changing event. Ivan Ilyich. Rewind.          TANDEM COMPETITIVE: Stories can be in tandem without competing-sharing the          same space or the same time or the same characters with some different factor.          In my novel, similar characters appear in different space. It seems as if they          are in the same time because they occupy the same novel, but one is in the          active, impressionistic, dreamlike present and one the past imperfect, one in          the eternal present of dreams and one in a specific period in society and          history. They compete when they rival each other for truth from the Reader's          POV. There must be a reason why stories are told in tandem. In real life, two          versions of the same story are constantly competing in our minds, a phenomenon          which reaches its extreme state in bipolar illness where the same state of          events can be interpreted as depressing or uplifting, depending on the mood, or          actions are constructed to reap those same results, depending on the mood. In          other words, something exists before the story because the story is simply how          specific people engage in certain events in a specific time and place.          Therefore, their objectives, moods, abilities and proclivities as well as social conditions are set before the story occurs. Hence different moods and objectives          can actually create somewhat different stories. We sometimes see scenes on split          screen or split stage or alternating chapters of narrators in a novel. This          narrative style is particularly disturbing as we don't know what kind of truth          to accept and our mood is constantly jarred by the constant switches. Yet this          is exactly what happens in psychosis.          LINEAR: Linear is the most common kind of storytelling in which a beginning,          middle and end follows similar linearity in time and space. However, in dreams,          linear storytelling does not necessarily have a cause-effect as is commonly          understood. In Hollywood screenplays, script doctors are brought in to make sure          there is a causal relationship to the scenes. Usually linear storytelling is          told by one narrator, whether first, third or the camera, but in pass the ball          linear narrative, multiple narrators carry the same story in sequence, the way          storytellers passed tales through the desert from oasis to oasis through          different caravans. They tried hard to be true to the story, but each          storyteller obviously colored the tale based on his perceptions and values. In          my second novel I chose 18 nonhuman narrators or human extensions, as McLuhan          would say, to carry the story. This is a technique still used today by writers          like Naguib Mahfouz, Yusuf al Qa'id in War in the Land of Egypt and Orhan Pamuk          in My Name is Red. You can have multiple narrators without a linear story as in          Akhenaten and some of Faulkner's work, but pass the ball linear is like the game          broken telephone where narrators try to pace their addition to the story          embedded in sequence within its entire history. This gives tremendous importance          to the story but protects it from the fallacies of omniscient narrators like          those of Tolstoi. Pass the ball linear doesn't lend itself that well to film          although it is possible it could be done-something as disciplined as War in the          Land of Egypt might work well. My second novel would be hard to film and keep          all those narrators. Some things are too difficult to visualize in this          narrative. Films and plays take place in a linear fashion but they can refer to          events that occur out of sequence in time.          CONGLOMERATE:It seems that in conglomerate narrative, there must be an active          throughline in the present that covers winter to winter -one year which is the          surface of the rock. Then the layers are the back stories. How does this differ          from recursive narrative? Recursive features the past to solve a problem in the          present like Oedipus Rex; while conglomerate has a hard active linear present          that covers layers of secrets, lies, and history in the past. Conglomerate is          neither tandem nor competitive, nor does it deal with the future. The past is          not imperfect past but singular events that influence the present. Is          conglomerate the right word? The idea is that there is a superficial story with          deeper stories underneath, some of which may be too disgusting, disappointing,          depressing or disarming for the Reader or Viewer to stomach. For example, soap          operas skim the surface of narrative, idealizing characters and romanticizing          situations by avoiding depressing details. How many people lie dying with          perfect hair and make-up? In a hypertext story there can be the top layer of          narrative for everyone, then layers underneath which symbolize gossip,          pettiness, uncomfortable facts, and finally those things that are usually          censored. This would be one way to deal with Internet censorship. This is          different from the usual hypertext story of branching narratives where different          future outcomes are envisioned.                 Parallel structures like The Hours are not sub-plots. The danger         here is to be choppy if the sequencing isn't right and there aren't enough          similarities or differences between the stories. It is like comparison and        contrast in literary criticism. Choppy, flowing, choppy, flowing. But if the          narrators argue, if the stories bleed into each other for a reason, it gives the        whole story more depth. The Matrix has a number of parallel structures.Instead of repetition, it might be good to spiral the action so that when          characters revisit the scene they attack the problem in a different way.         Sometimes the event is seen in flashback.                 The Unraveling-mystery structure is used with whodunits. The skill involves          laying clues throughout the film and then learning the truth in the third act.                   In Memento the whole film is a flashback so that it is a reverse structure.        The trick is to keep the audience asking a central dramatic question. There must        always be a puzzle for the audience to solve. In a circular structure there must          still be linear parts. Pulp fiction has a looping structure of        beginning-end-middle and more. Non-linear stories require more structure than usual so that don't break up,        dissolve or fly into different directions. Good drama combusts time. Even with different time periods like The        Hours, it is possible to carry objects like the flowers and book from one        setting to the next.       It mustn't feel like a string of stories pieced together from disparate        places, similar to a bad research paper without a central thesis.          A good sequencing technique is to imply an action in a that is carried out or          frustrated or somehow commented upon in b. Or cut from an object in one to a          similar one in the other. Or the setup of a joke is one scene and the punchline in the next. Just as dance routines can be choppy if the movements aren't connected,         scenes can be choppy if they have no relationship to each other.         Use your imaginations to come up with the best sequence. I get inspired by books like Einstein's Dreams by physicist writer Alan Lightman whom I met at a media in transition conference where I was disguising the tandem-competitive and conglomerate sequencing of a recent novel that had just been published. Einstein's Dreams describes so many       ways of living time as if it were one day, going backwards, rushing to Apocalypse,        turned into space, or torn between biological and mechanical time.The        smaller the space of the medium, the wider the world of it story-books and         computers.\u00a0                   Why do the tenses of our language support the uni-directional nature of time,          running madly in only one direction, organizing life into hierarchies of what's          remembered and what's hoped for?                   Why does Western classical drama observe the unities of space, time and          action with a rising and falling arc of energy that is supposed to create an          emotional catharsis?                   What happens if a story starts at the end and ends at the beginning?                   Can a story exist in the present with no directionality or get caught up in          a centrifugal or centripetal force?                   What kind of timespace distortions occur with the branching directions of          hyperfiction?                   What happens when we infuse narrative with black holes, big bangs, big          crunches, asymmetries and relativities, arrows and loops?                   How can basic principles of physics such as ten dimensions, Stephen          Hawking's observations, Einstein's general theory of relativity, the latest          developments in thermodynamics, quantum theory and cosmology influence creative          writing and literature majors with no scientific background?\u00a0                   Rhythm is determined by how long you stay in each scene and dynamics the quality of your transitions, just like dance or serving courses.          If you take too long eating a huge pasta dish, you won't have room or time for anything else.\u00a0                   Levels of Truth          How is your creation related to the real world? A         documentary records the real world as is without any attempt to          make up a story. Naturalism creates fiction or film that          resembles reality, even if it is ugly or aesthetically displeasing.   Realism manipulates reality artistically but extracts some truth from it, as in Greek and Shakespearean tragedy. Fantasy adds an element or elements of setting, being or behavior that could not occur in real life, although the basic world may be realistic.   Science Fiction constructs an entire imaginary world, although characters or forces may        resembler real life. Surrealism superimposes extraordinary over        ordinary reality, often producing incongruous, wild and wonderful images.          Impressionism gives us fragments of reality to fill in with our        imagination, similar to what happens when we recall our dreams. It is the        writer's job to believe in the world she creates and describe it so that the        reader or audience experiences a suspension of disbelief          that          allows them to treat this world as even more important to them than the real         world, while engaged in reading the book or viewing the film.                                       You have one large, unwieldy document with a patchwork of close textual analyses and forum entries throughout the semester. How can you organize it into a thoughtful inquiry paper that links your thesis to the readings this semester? This lesson will help you identify, define, and refine claims of value, link the claims to your close textual analyses, and draw up an outline.               Linking and Synthesis                      This course develops two kinds of thinking--close textual analysis and synthesis through linking. Your weekly CTs, based on the three Lessons I wrote on the Music of Words, Story/Structure/Sequencing, and Characterization, are good for the introductory level of this course, although you could do more situating the passage in the overall dramatic structure and relating style to content.       Linking or synthesis is the objective of the final forum paper. The World Wide Web is based on linking and it is an essential tool to help us think better as our brains are a web on synaptic connections.       Barbara' Hoblitzell's paper th linking Wild Ginger to her education theme is a succinct, 2-page example of how to link your CTs to your forum topic. The challenge for Barbara will be to link all the books with more complex connotative language. Please look at her paper below.\u00a0       \u00a0    Close Textual Analysis:     Wild Ginger, Anchee Min     \u00a0     \u00a0    1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I remembered a story from One-Eye Grandpa.\u00a0He said he\u2019d once had a hard time explaining to a    2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 group of village children what a book was. They had never seen one.\u00a0He was a veteran at that    3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 time and was passing through town. I was sure Evergreen and I would have made a difference.    4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What a pity.     Short utterance     \u00a0    While this passage is short and lacks the color and imagery that lends itself so well to close textual analysis, I am drawn to it because it is at once both a frank and honest statement, coupled with the childlike hopes and dreams of a romantic. This passage takes place as Maple spends her eighteenth birthday in jail, serving time for a crime she has not only not committed, but for which she was accused in an act of revenge and betrayal by her best friend, Wild Ginger.\u00a0She is torn between her lasting feelings for her friend, the impending loss of her lover, and the dreams she once held for her future.    While it is at this juncture in the story that Maple acknowledges the love triangle that had formed between Wild Ginger, Evergreen and herself, I found myself focusing on the brief reference to One-Eyed Grandpa\u2019s experience with the village children who could not imagine what a book was because they had never seen one.\u00a0While Mao denounced intellectualism and hijacked the educational system in China for his own political aims, it is doubtful that the education of the village children had been curtailed, as they likely had never had access to books, classrooms, or teachers.    In my forum, Knowledge is Power, I have asserted that knowledge and power are derived from a multitude of sources and are used for as many purposes.\u00a0As other forums have explored, the experience of human life in harsh circumstances is the catalyst for many defining actions, decisions, philosophical and political leanings, as well as the ultimate formation of one\u2019s truest self.\u00a0For many, life in harsh circumstances gives birth to an intractable sense of dignity and/or spirituality that also serves to enable one to endure and persevere.\u00a0Under those conditions, the knowledge gained is not gleaned from didactic sources, great works of literature, or another\u2019s expertise.\u00a0It flows from within, from each person\u2019s experience of the world and the moment they are living.\u00a0As we examined the sources of knowledge and power, and more importantly, how it was wielded, there emerged vast array of examples from across the literary clusters.    Danielle Chauncey observed that \u201cIn Ulysses, James Joyce confronts religion head on and early through a conversation between Haines and Stephen: \u2018Either you believe or you don't, isn't it? \u00a0Personally I couldn't stomach that idea of a personal God. \u00a0You don't stand for that, I suppose?\u2019 \u00a0    To which Stephen responds: \u2018You behold in me a horrible example of free thought.\u2019 Considering the book itself is a reflection on Odysseus in the Odyssey who encountered immortal God after immortal God, Stephen seems to believe in the authority of God, whereas Haines is self-reliant. \u00a0Haines is what many people are today, not atheist or a pagan, but floating between two movements. \u00a0One that wants to leave the church behind, and one that can't.\u201d    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eric Ayers shared his impression of \u201c\u2026The Bluest Eye, [wherein] the narrator's big sister was the source of her knowledge.\u00a0 The source of our knowledge must be chosen carefully.\u00a0 One has to have a variety of sources to get the best perspective on any given idea.\u00a0 America is the greatest country in the world.\u00a0 I say that because this is all I know, but I've never lived in Denmark or Singapore.\u00a0 My source of knowledge is the small part of the world that I've seen so far.\u00a0 This is not a very educated perspective.\u201d    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ryan Hinricher noted that \u201cIn Ayn Rand's Anthem, we see the character Equality 7-2521 discover electricity. His attempt to deliver this to the Council of Scholars is struck down as evil.\u00a0\u2018And if this great thing shall lighten the toil of men,\u2019 said Similarity 5-0306, \u2018then it is a great evil, for men have no cause to exist save in toiling for other men.\u2019 Then collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box.\u00a0 \u2018This thing,\u2019 they said, \u2018must be destroyed.\u2019 ... later in the text, after changing his name from Equality 7-2521 to Promethus, he declares,\u00a0\u2018I have learned the power of the sky was known to men long ago; they called it Electricity. It was the power that moved their greatest inventions. \u00a0It lit this house with light that came from those globes of glass on the walls. \u00a0I have found the engine which produced this light. \u00a0I shall learn how to repair it and how to make it work again. \u00a0I shall learn how to use the wires which carry this power. \u00a0Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my home, and across the paths which lead to my home; a barrier light as a cobweb, more impassable than a wall of granite...(Loc 849).\u2019 His attempt to deliver the invention as a gift was only seen as a threat by the oppressive Council. \u00a0He felt it worthy to retreat with it to the forest and make his own way. \u00a0Still his plan was to use it for defensive means only.\u201dJulia Keefer opined \u201cIronically, the most powerful character in God Dies by the Nile is Zakeya, an illiterate peasant with no formal knowledge, who\u00a0ends up having the power and the hoe to kill the Mayor. In Ulysses, all Stephen's bookish knowledge seems to get him tangled up in all kinds of internal conflicts and dilemmas, almost like Othello, another character of extreme knowledge and intelligence.    \u00a0In Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, Reading Lolita in Tehran, and Red Azalea, knowledge is forbidden. To survive you must hide or burn it. This is the case in One Man's Bible where Gao Xi Jiang burned all his books before the Red Guard entered his house. In Soul Mountain the protagonist finds knowledge buried in the earth, deep inside the mountains of China, deep inside the many pronouns that make up himself. In Night and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, characters survive by concentrating on the details of the present moment. Too much knowledge of their fate might render them impotent, and dead. But this doesn't mean knowledge isn't good. The AUTHORS of these books had extreme knowledge but maybe it was so painful to them that they empowered characters who lacked some of their intelligence. Saadawi does that all the time.\u201d\u00a0Keefer followed up with a challenge: \u201cWhat is your definition of knowledge? Does it include all cognitive domains and sensory experience? Then Zakeya has more knowledge than previously thought.\u201d    \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, I have always applied the broadest definition to the concept of knowledge, recognizing that people both possess\u00a0innate understanding of certain things (e.g., intuition, emotional intelligence, etc.) and acquire new knowledge through every experience.\u00a0 How individuals incorporate and apply that knowledge over the course of their lives varies greatly, as does the power each person derives from what they know.\u00a0 Such is the case for Maple, as her education has been limited by the precepts of Mao and her knowledge is continually challenged and censored until she is nearly unable to discern her own experience.\u00a0In the end, she is able to reflect on all that she has seen, heard and felt throughout her tumultuous teenage years and decide for herself her truth.&quot;          Content Notes   Perfume is an historical literary thriller because the narrator is inside the criminal protagonist's head, shares his pathology with the reader, and there is no mystery to solve just a linear plot that unfolds with suspense. As a screenwriter, Suskind is an organized, talented dramatist and this novel is meticulously researched and carefully structured according to classical dramatic paradigms. But the idea is novel and the character unique is literature. It also tells us a lot about the Enlightenment and eighteenth century France.               Authors' Words                      The following quotes have been taken from the writing of major twentieth century writers. If you read through them all at once, what overview do you get of this century intellectually? Now, go back and savor each quote. Imagine who might have written it. Then find out.       The future belongs to crowds.    When the old God goes, they pray to flies and bottletops.    Hell is other people.    Writing and reading...require being alert and ready for unaccountable beauty, for the intricateness or simple elegance of the writer's imagination, for the world that imagination evokes. Both require being mindful of the places where imagination sabotages itself, locks its own gates, pollutes its vision. Writing and reading mean being aware of the writer's notions of risk and safety, the serene achievement of, or sweaty fight for, meaning and response-ability.    Whatever may be their use in civilised societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action.    Poets are men who refuse to utilize language.    Some say it is best not to go near the center of time. Life is a vessel of sadness, but it is noble to live life, and without time there is no life. Others disagree. They would rather have an eternity of contentment, even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly mounted in a case.    &quot;Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates success.&quot; That is a man's sentence;...it was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman's use....Moreover a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes. And this shape too has been made by men out of their own needs for their own uses. There is no reason to think that the form of the epic or the poetic play suits a woman any more than the sentence suits her. The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands-- another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels.       The &quot;engaged&quot; writer knows that words are actions.   Writers are among the most sensitive, the most intellectually anarchic, most representative, most probing of artists. The ability of writers to imagine what is not the self, to familiarize the strange and mystify the familiar, is the test of their power. The languages they use and the social and historical context in which these languages signify are indirect and direct revelations of that power and its limitations.   Why write? Each one has his reasons: for one, art is a flight; for another, a means of conquering.   One of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the need of feeling that we are essential in relation to the world.   All our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and in the first place for the workers, peasants and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants and soldiers and are for their use.   ...a great mind is androgynous. It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilised and uses all its faculties.   Like a domestic animal, time doesn't move without human beings' strict supervision.   When the words form under his pen, the author doubtless sees them, but he does not see them as the reader does, since he knows them before writing them down. The function of his gaze is not to reveal, by stroking them, the sleeping words which are waiting to be read, but to control the sketching of the signs.   What does death matter? Communism is the truth. Because they appear almost always in conjunction with representations of black or Africanist people who are dead, impotent, or under complete control, these images of blinding whiteness seem to function as both antidote for and meditation on the shadow that is companion to this whiteness-- a dark and abiding presence that moves the hearts and texts of American literature with fear and longing.   Imagine a world in which there is no time. Only images.   Race has become metaphorical-- a way of referring to and disguising forces, events, classes, and expressions of social decay and economic division far more threatening to the body politic than biological &quot;race&quot; ever was.   It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly. It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a woman. And fatal is no figure of speech for anything written with that conscious bias is doomed to death. It ceases to be fertilised. ...Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the act of creation can be accomplished.   Reading seems, in fact, to be the synthesis of perception and creation.   In this world, there are two times. There is mechanical time and there is body time. The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum of iron that swings back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. The second squirms and wriggles like a bluefish at bay. The first is unyielding, predetermined. The second makes up its mind as it goes along.... Where the two times meet, desperation. Where the two times go their separate ways, contentment. ... Each time is true but the truths are not the same.   There is no romance free of what Herman Melville called &quot;the power of blackness,&quot; especially not in a country in which there was a resident population, already black, upon which the imagination could play; through which historical, moral, metaphysical, and social fears, problems, and dichotomies could be articulated. The slave population, it could be and was assumed, offered itself up as surrogate selves for meditation on problems of human freedom, its lure and its elusiveness. This black population was available for meditations on terror-- the terror of European outcasts, their dread of failure, powerlessness, Nature without limits, natal loneliness, internal aggression, evil, sin, greed.  \u00a0   I am therefore I think.       In order to know himself, each person carries his own Book of Life, which is filled with the history of his life. ...With time, each person's Book of Life thickens until it cannot be read in its entirety....Some have stopped reading altogether. ... Such people walk with the limber stride of their youth. Such people have learned how to live in a world without memory.       Existence precedes essence.     I fear for you young people because you do not understand how strong is the bond of kinship. You do not know what it is to speak with one voice. And what is the result? An abominable religion has settled among you. A man can now leave his father and his brotheres. He can curse the gods of his fathers and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes mad and turns on his master.      For detailed lectures on this, consult Ulysses versus Satanic Verses lecture.    \u00a0    First of all, let's examine a few of the most common narrative and stylistic devices found in postmodern texts:\u00a0       1. Postmodern literature often uses confusing chronology, jumping from one historical period to another and from one character's thoughts to another character's thoughts without any indication at all.\u00a0       2. In 350 B. C. Aristotle wrote that every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. With postmodern texts, that's not always the case. Postmodern writers often leave their stories open-ended, with no satisfying conclusion, or the book concludes by making a reference back to the beginning, thereby offering circularity.\u00a0       3. Postmodern stories and novels often rely on parody or satire, revealing little tolerance for aspects of our culture that typically evoke reverence.\u00a0This parody or satire is partly what got Rushdie in trouble with the Islamists.       4. The postmodern text, at heart, reveals skepticism about the ability of art to create meaning, about the ability of history to reveal truth, about the ability of language to convey reality. All of that skepticism leads to fragmented, open-ended, self-reflexive stories that are intellectually fascinating but often difficult to grasp on the first read.     Structuralism is appealing to some critics because it adds a certain objectivity, a SCIENTIFIC objectivity, to the realm of literary studies (which have often been criticized as purely subjective/impressionistic). This scientific objectivity is achieved by subordinating &quot;parole&quot; to &quot;langue;&quot; actual usage is abandoned in favor of studying the structure of a system in the abstract. Thus structuralist readings ignore the specificity of actual texts and treat them as if they were like the patterns produced by iron filings moved by magnetic force--the result of some impersonal force or power, not the result of human effort.      In structuralism, the individuality of the text disappears in favor of looking at patterns, systems, and structures. Some structuralists (and a related school of critics, called the Russian Formalists) propose that ALL narratives can be charted as variations on certain basic universal narrative patterns.      In this way of looking at narratives, the author is canceled out, since the text is a function of a system, not of an individual. The Romantic humanist model holds that the author is the origin of the text, its creator, and hence is the starting point or progenitor of the text. Structuralism argues that any piece of writing, or any signifying system, has no origin, and that authors merely inhabit pre-existing structures (langue) that enable them to make any particular sentence (or story)--any parole. Hence the idea that &quot;language speaks us,&quot; rather than that we speak language. We don't originate language; we inhabit a structure that enables us to speak; what we (mis)perceive as our originality is simply our recombination of some of the elements in the pre-existing system. Hence every text, and every sentence we speak or write, is made up of the &quot;already written.&quot;      By focusing on the system itself, in a synchronic analysis, structuralists cancel out history. Most insist, as Levi-Strauss does, that structures are universal, therefore timeless. Structuralists can't account for change or development; they are uninterested, for example, in how literary forms may have changed over time. They are not interested in a text's production or reception/consumption, but only in the structures that shape it.      In erasing the author, the individual text, the reader, and history, structuralism represented a major challenge to what we now call the &quot;liberal humanist&quot; tradition in literary criticism.      The HUMANIST model presupposed:   1.) That there is a real world out there that we can understand with our rational minds.     2.) That language is capable of (more or less) accurately depicting that real world..      3.) That language is a product of the individual writer's mind or free will, meaning that we determine what we say, and what we mean when we say it; that language thus expresses the essence of our individual beings (and that there is such a thing as an essential unique individual &quot;self&quot;).      4.) the SELF--also known as the &quot;subject,&quot; since that's how we represent the idea of a self in language, by saying I, which is the subject of a sentence--or the individual (or the mind or the free will) is the center of all meaning and truth; words mean what I say they mean, and truth is what I perceive as truth. I create my own sentences out of my own individual experiences and need for individual expression.     The STRUCTURALIST model argues   1.) that the structure of language itself produces &quot;reality&quot;--that we can think only through language, and therefore our perceptions of reality are all framed by and determined by the structure of language.     2.) That language speaks us; that the source of meaning is not an individual's experience or being, but the sets of oppositions and operations, the signs and grammars that govern language. Meaning doesn't come from individuals, but from the system that governs what any individual can do within it.      3.) Rather than seeing the individual as the center of meaning, structuralism places THE STRUCTURE at the center--it's the structure that originates or produces meaning, not the individual self. Language in particular is the center of self and meaning; I can only say &quot;I&quot; because I inhabit a system of language in which the position of subject is marked by the first personal pronoun, hence my identity is the product of the linguistic system I occupy.   \u00a0   This is also where deconstruction starts to come in. The leading figure in deconstruction, Jacques Derrida, looks at philosophy (Western metaphysics) to see that any system necessarily posits a CENTER, a point from which everything comes, and to which everything refers or returns. Sometimes it's God, sometimes it's the human self, the mind, sometimes it's the unconscious, depending on what philosophical system (or set of beliefs) one is talking about.     There are two key points to the idea of deconstruction. First is that we're still going to look at systems or structures, rather than at individual concrete practices, and that all systems or structures have a CENTER, the point of origin, the thing that created the system in the first place. Second is that all systems or structures are created of binary pairs or oppositions, of two terms placed in some sort of relation to each.      Derrida says that such systems are always built of the basic units structuralism analyzes--the binary opposition or pair--and that within these systems one part of that binary pair is always more important than the other, that one term is &quot;marked&quot; as positive and the other as negative. Hence in the binary pair good/evil, good is what Western philosophy values, and evil is subordinated to good. Derrida argues that all binary pairs work this way--light/dark, masculine/feminine, right/left; in Western culture, the first term is always valued over the second.      In his most famous work, Of Grammatology, Derrida looks particularly at the opposition speech/writing, saying that speech is always seen as more important than writing. This may not be as self-evident as the example of good/evil, but it's true in terms of linguistic theories, where speech is posited as the first or primary form of language, and writing is just the transcription of speech. Derrida says speech gets privileged because speech is associated with presence--for there to be spoken language, somebody has to be there to be speaking.      No, he doesn't take into account tape recordings and things like that. Remember, a lot of what these guys are talking about has roots in philosophic and linguistic traditions that predate modern technology--so that Derrida is responding to an opposition (speech/writing) that Plato set up, long before there were tape recorders. Just like poor old Levi-Strauss talks about how, in order to map all the dimensions of a myth, he'd have to have &quot;punch cards and an IBM machine,&quot; when all he'd need now is a home computer. Anyway, the idea is that the spoken word guarantees the existence of somebody doing the speaking--thus it reinforces all those great humanist ideas, like that there's a real self that is the origin of what's being said. Derrida calls this idea of the self that has to be there to speak part of the metaphysics of PRESENCE; the idea of being, or presence, is central to all systems of Western philosophy, from Plato through Descartes (up to Derrida himself). Presence is part of a binary opposition presence/absence, in which presence is always favored over absence. Speech gets associated with presence, and both are favored over writing and absence; this privileging of speech and presence is what Derrida calls LOGOCENTRISM. You might think here about the Biblical phrase &quot;Let there be light&quot; as an example. The statement insures that there is a God (the thing doing the speaking), and that God is present (because speech=presence); the present God is the origin of all things (because God creates the world by speaking), and what God creates is binary oppositions (starting with light/dark). You might also think about other binary oppositions or pairs, including being/nothingness, reason/madness, word/silence, culture/nature, mind/body. Each term has meaning only in reference to the other (light is what is not dark, and vice-versa), just as, in Saussure's view, signifiers only have meaning--or negative value--in relation to other signifiers. These binary pairs are the &quot;structures,&quot; or fundamental opposing ideas, that Derrida is concerned with in Western philosophy.   Because of the favoring of presence over absence, speech is favored over writing (and, as we'll see with Freud, masculine is favored over feminine because the penis is defined as a presence, whereas the female genitals are defined as absence). It's because of this favoring of presence over absence that every system posits a CENTER, a place from which the whole system comes, and which guarantees its meaning--this center guarantees being as presence. Think of your entire self as a kind of system--everything you do, think, feel, etc. is part of that system. At the core or center of your mental and physical life is a notion of SELF, of an &quot;I&quot;, of an identity that is stable and unified and coherent, the part of you that knows who you mean when you say &quot;I&quot;. This core self or &quot;I&quot; is thus the CENTER of the &quot;system&quot;, the &quot;langue&quot; of your being, and every other part of you (each individual act) is part of the &quot;parole&quot;. The &quot;I&quot; is the origin of all you say and do, and it guarantees the idea of your presence, your being. Western thought has a whole bunch of terms that serve as centers to systems --being, essence, substance, truth, form, consciousness, man, god, etc. What Derrida tells us is that each of these terms designating the center of a system serves two purposes: it's the thing that created the system, that originated it and guarantees that all the parts of the system interrelate, and it's also something beyond the system, not governed by the rules of the system. It is crucially important to note that LANGUAGE, as a system or structure, DOES NOT HAVE A CENTER. There is no central term or idea that creates language and that holds it all together. This is an extremely important idea, for Derrida and for poststructuralism. Without a center to hold the elements of the system in place, there is no absolute or definitive &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;meaning.&quot; Language is always shifting and moving, not fixed by a center-- hence meaning is ALWAYS ambiguous, multiple, and provisional. We will be talking about this idea throughout the rest of the semester. Derrida looks at how a binary opposition--the fundamental unit of the structures or systems we've been looking at, and of the philosophical systems he refers to--functions within a system. He points out that a binary opposition is algebraic (a=~b, a equals not-b), and that two terms can't exist without reference to the other--light (as presence) is defined as the absence of darkness, goodness the absence of evil, etc. He doesn't seek to reverse the hierarchies implied in binary pairs--to make evil favored over good, unconscious over consciousness, feminine over masculine. Rather, deconstruction wants to erase the boundaries (the slash) between oppositions, hence to show that the values and order implied by the opposition are also not rigid. Here's the basic method of deconstruction: find a binary opposition. Show how each term, rather than being polar opposite of its paired term, is actually part of it. Then the structure or opposition which kept them apart collapses, as we see with the terms nature and culture in Derrida's essay. Ultimately, you can't tell which is which, and the idea of binary opposites loses meaning, or is put into &quot;play&quot; (more on this in the next lecture). This method is called &quot;Deconstruction&quot; because it is a combination of construction/destruction--the idea is that you don't simply construct new system of binaries, with the previously subordinated term on top, nor do you destroy the old system--rather, you deconstruct the old system by showing how its basic units of structuration (binary pairs and the rules for their combination) contradict their own logic.\u00a0   In the seventies, Professor Keefer acted with a Structuralist Theater Company directed by Michael Kirby, her NYU Dissertation Advisor. He was color-blind, but interested in the patterns of black and white on the stage, so everyone wore black and white, opened and closed umbrellas, and spoke in foreign languages--French, Italian, Spanish, Korean, Japanese etc. From the Aristotelian point of view, the &quot;drama&quot; made no sense, but Kirby said it made sense structurally. In the middle I got to do wild dancing to the Stones for a brief cathartic relief, but then we went back to those patterns of coming and going in black and white. This Structuralism was influenced by Soviet theater and became an important part of the American experimental theater movement.               Feminist Criticism                      Feminist criticism is a type of literary criticism, which may study and advocate the rights of women. As Judith Fetterley says, &quot;Feminist criticism is a political act whose aim is not simply to interpret the world but to change it by changing the consciousness of those who read and their relation to what they read.&quot; Using feminist criticism to analyze fiction may involve studying the repression of women in fiction. How do men and women differ? What is different about female heroines, and why are these characters important in literary history? In addition to many of the questions raised by a study of women in literature, feminist criticism may study stereotypes, creativity, ideology, racial issues, marginality, and more.   Recently, feminist criticism has been criticized for perverting the classics by not appreciating their aesthetic values since they were written by the male, pale and stale. Censorship can occur from being too politically correct and not letting a work of art grow and breathe naturally.                   Marxist Criticism                      Karl Marx (1818-1883) was primarily a theorist and historian (less the evil pinko commie demon that McCarthyism fretted about). After examining social organization in a scientific way (thereby creating a methodology for social science: political science), he perceived human history to have consisted of a series of struggles between classes--between the oppressed and the oppressing. Whereas Freud saw &quot;sexual energy&quot; to be the motivating factor behind human endeavor and Nabokov seemed to feel artistic impulse was the real factor, Marx thought that &quot;historical materialism&quot; was the ultimate driving force, a notion involving the distribution of resources, gain, production, and such matters.    The supposedly &quot;natural&quot; political evolution involved (and would in the future involve) &quot;feudalism&quot; leading to &quot;bourgeois capitalism&quot; leading to &quot;socialism&quot; and finally to &quot;utopian communism.&quot; In bourgeois capitalism, the privileged bourgeoisie rely on the proletariat--the labor force responsible for survival. Marx theorized that when profits are not reinvested in the workers but in creating more factories, the workers will grow poorer and poorer until no short-term patching is possible or successful. At a crisis point, revolt will lead to a restructuring of the system.    For a political system to be considered communist, the underclasses must own the means of production--not the government nor the police force. Therefore, aside from certain first-century Christian communities and other temporary communes, communism has not yet really existed. (The Soviet Union was actually state-run capitalism.)    Marx is known also for saying that &quot;Religion is the opiate of the people,&quot; so he was somewhat aware of the problem that Lenin later dwelt on. Lenin was convinced that workers remain largely unaware of their own oppression since they are convinced by the state to be selfless. One might point to many &quot;opiates of the people&quot; under most political systems--diversions that prevent real consideration of trying to change unjust economic conditions.           Marxist Criticism              According to Marxists, and to other scholars in fact, literature reflects those social institutions out of which it emerges and is itself a social institution with a particular ideological function. Literature reflects class struggle and materialism: think how often the quest for wealth traditionally defines characters. So Marxists generally view literature &quot;not as works created in accordance with timeless artistic criteria, but as 'products' of the economic and ideological determinants specific to that era&quot; (Abrams 149). Literature reflects an author's own class or analysis of class relations, however piercing or shallow that analysis may be.    The Marxist critic simply is a careful reader or viewer who keeps in mind issues of power and money, and any of the following kinds of questions:       What role does class play in the work; what is the author's analysis of class relations?    How do characters overcome oppression?    In what ways does the work serve as propaganda for the status quo; or does it try to undermine it?    What does the work say about oppression; or are social conflicts ignored or blamed elsewhere?    Does the work propose some form of utopian vision as a solution to the problems encountered in the work?                      Eco-criticism                      Ecocritics investigate such things as the underlying ecological values, what is meant by the word nature, and whether the examination of &quot;place&quot; should be a distinctive category, much like class, gender or race. Ecocritics examine human perception of wilderness , and how it has changed throughout history and whether or not current environmental issues are accurately represented or even mentioned in popular culture and modern literature. Other disciplines, such as history, philosophy, ethics, and psychology, are also considered by ecocritics to be possible contributors to ecocriticism.    William Rueckert may have been the first person to use the term ecocriticism (Barry 240). In 1978, Rueckert published an essay titled Literature and Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism. His intent was to focus on \u201cthe application of ecology and ecological concepts to the study of literature.\u201d (Reprinted in The Ecocritism Reader on p.\u00a0107)    Ecologically minded individuals and scholars have been publishing progressive works of ecotheory and criticism since the explosion of environmentalism in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, because there was no organized movement to study the ecological/environmental side of literature, these important works were scattered and categorized under a litany of different subject headings: pastoralism, human ecology, regionalism, American Studies etc. British Marxist critic Raymond Williams , for example, wrote a seminal critique of pastoral literature in 1973, The Country and the City , which spawned two decades of leftist suspicion of the ideological evasions of the genre and its habit of making the work of rural labour disappear even though Williams himself observed that the losses lamented in pastoral might be genuine ones, and went on to profess a decidedly green socialism.    Another early ecocritical text, Joseph Meeker's The Comedy of Survival (1974), proposed a version of an argument that was later to dominate ecocriticism and environmental philosophy; that environmental crisis is caused primarily by a cultural tradition in the West of separation of culture from nature, and elevation of the former to moral predominance. Such 'anthropocentrism' is identified in the tragic conception of a hero whose moral struggles are more important than mere biological survival, whereas the science of animal ethology, Meeker asserts, shows that a &quot;comic mode&quot; of muddling through and &quot;making love not war&quot; has superior ecological value. In the later, &quot;second wave&quot; ecocriticism, Meeker's adoption of an ecophilosophical position with apparent scientific sanction as a measure of literary value tended to prevail over Williams's ideological and historical critique of the shifts in a literary genre's representation of nature.    As Glotfelty noted in The Ecocriticism Reader , \u201cOne indication of the disunity of the early efforts is that these critics rarely cited one another\u2019s work; they didn\u2019t know that it existed\u2026Each was a single voice howling in the wilderness.\u201d Nevertheless, ecocriticism\u2014unlike feminist and Marxist criticisms\u2014failed to crystallize into a coherent movement in the late 1970s, and indeed only did so in the USA in the 1990s.       In the mid 1980s, scholars began to work collectively to establish ecocritism as a genre, primarily through the work of the Western Literature Association in which the revaluation of nature writing as a non-fictional literary genre could function. In 1990, at the University of Nevada in Reno, Glotfelty became the first person to hold an academic position as a professor of Literature and the Environment, and UNR has retained the position it established at that time as the intellectual home of ecocriticism even as ASLE has burgeoned into an organization with thousands of members in the US alone. From the late 1990s, new branches of ASLE and affiliated organizations were started in the UK, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand (ASLEC-ANZ), India (OSLE-India}, Taiwan, Canada and Europe.   In comparison with other 'political' forms of criticism, there has been relatively little dispute about the moral and philosophical aims of ecocriticism, although its scope has broadened rapidly from nature writing, Romantic poetry canonical literature to take in film, TV, theatre, animal stories, architectures, scientific narratives and an extraordinary range of literary texts. At the same time, ecocriticism has borrowed methodologies and theoretically-informed approaches liberally from other fields of literary, social and scientific study.   Glotfelty's working definition in The Ecocriticism Reader is that &quot;ecocriticism is the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment&quot; (xviii), and one of the implicit goals of the approach is to recoup professional dignity for what Glotfelty calls the &quot;undervalued genre of nature writing&quot; (xxxi). Lawrence Buell defines \u201c\u2018ecocriticism\u2019 . . . as [a] study of the relationship between literature and the environment conducted in a spirit of commitment to environmentalist praxis\u201d (430, n.20).   Simon Estok noted in 2001 that \u201cecocriticism has distinguished itself, debates notwithstanding, firstly by the ethical stand it takes, its commitment to the natural world as an important thing rather than simply as an object of thematic study, and, secondly, by its commitment to making connections\u201d (\u201cA Report Card on Ecocriticism\u201d 220).   More recently, in an article that extends ecocriticism to Shakespearean studies, Estok argues that ecocriticism is more than \u201csimply the study of Nature or natural things in literature; rather, it is any theory that is committed to effecting change by analyzing the function\u2013thematic, artistic, social, historical, ideological, theoretical, or otherwise\u2013of the natural environment, or aspects of it, represented in documents (literary or other) that contribute to material practices in material worlds\u201d (\u201cShakespeare and Ecocriticism\u201d 16-17). This echoes the functional approach of the cultural ecology branch of ecocriticism, which analyzes the analogies between ecosystems and imaginative texts and posits that such texts potentially have an ecological (regenerative, revitalizing) function in the cultural system (Zapf, &quot;Literary Ecology&quot;).   As Michael P. Cohen has observed, \u201cif you want to be an ecocritic, be prepared to explain what you do and be criticized, if not satirized.\u201d Certainly, Cohen adds his voice to such critique, noting that one of the problems of ecocriticism has been what he calls its \u201cpraise-song school\u201d of criticism. All ecocritics share an environmentalist motivation of some sort, but whereas the majority are 'nature endorsing' (as Kate Soper puts it in &quot;What is Nature?&quot; (1998)), some are 'nature sceptical'. In part this entails a shared sense of the ways in which 'nature' has been used to legitimise gender, sexual and racial norms (so homosexuality has been seen as 'unnatural', for example), but it also involves scepticism about the uses to which 'ecological' language is put in ecocriticism; it can also involve a critique of the ways cultural norms of nature and the environment contribute to environmental degradation. Greg Garrard has dubbed 'pastoral ecology' the notion that nature undisturbed is balanced and harmonious (&quot;Ecocriticism&quot; 56-58), while Dana Phillips has criticised the literary quality and scientific accuracy of nature writing in &quot;The Truth of Ecology&quot;. Similarly, there has been a call to recognize the place of the Environmental Justice movement in redefining ecocritical discourse (see Buell, &quot;Toxic Discourse&quot;).     In response to the question of what ecocriticism is or should be, Camilo Gomides has offered an operational definition that is both broad and discriminating: &quot;The field of enquiry that analyzes and promotes works of art which raise moral questions about human interactions with nature, while also motivating audiences to live within a limit that will be binding over generations&quot; (16). He tests it for a film (mal)adaptation about Amazonian deforestation. Implementing the Gomides definition, Joseph Henry Vogel makes the case that ecocriticism constitutes an &quot;economic school of thought&quot; as it engages audiences to debate issues of resource allocation that have no technical solution.   \u00a0   Those of you interested in eco-criticism should go to the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment www.asle.org to get the latest in this area. I followed this track at the recent MLA 2012 convention in Seattle and it is the most important criticism of the twenty-first century because of climate change, globalism, and ecological disaster.   \u00a0         Existentialism, as a philosophical movement beginning with Kierkegaard, Heidigger, Nietzsche, Marcel, Buber et al, reached its literary climax in the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980)\u00a0and Albert Camus (1913-1960).   \u00a0   Sartre wrote drama, fiction, and expository essays in a clear, didactic style that popularized axims like &quot;I am therefore I think&quot; as opposed to the Cartesian &quot;I think therefore I am,&quot; or &quot;Man is the sum of his actions,&quot; or &quot;Hell is other People,&quot; stressing the subjective experiences of the individual human being as opposed to the ideologies and systems we find in our fascist cluster. While some of the philosophers and writers were Christian or believe in God, many were atheist and agnostic, and all of them stresses the responsibility and freedom of the individual against the will or fate of an outside or super power. In part, this was a backlash to the totalitarianism of the twentieth century and the Papal power of Christianity. He turned down the Nobel Prize in 1964 as he was very radical and leftist even though he came from a bourgeois background.   \u00a0   Sartre is a phenomenal dramatist and one of my favorite works is his play, &quot;No Exit,&quot; which I have produced many times. A deserter, a baby-killer, and a lesbian are locked inside a room for eternity, their &quot;hell.&quot; Although they keep looking for the fire and brimstone of Dante's Inferno, they soon realize that &quot;hell is other people,&quot; and that their conflicting objectives and personal limitations will torment each other for eternity. If you want to study characterization and scene study, this one-act play is the best I can recommend for conflicting objectives in a short time and space without resorting to real violence--just a paper knife.   \u00a0   Sartre's book, What is Literature will help you explore the didactic aspect of his mission, not unlike El Saadawi or others on our list. I don't agree with everything he writes, but this simple, clear book can help you frame questions for your cross-cultural essay and/or your Forum essay. If you get ambitious, then read Nausea, Existentialism is a Humanism, and Being and Nothingness.   \u00a0   Albert Camus accepted his Nobel Prize in 1957 as the first African-born writer, three years before he was killed in a car accident. Although he was born in Algeria, he moved to France and was a French citizen and activist in communist causes before they turned totalitarian. \u00a0He was also a great football player.   \u00a0   His best play is Caligula, but you may be more familiar with his novels like The Stranger and The Plague .   \u00a0   He is also a thoughtful and talented essayist.

When I did my Masters in French Literature at the Sorbonne in the twentieth century, I wrote my thesis on the Theater of the Absurd and how it rebelled against the constraints of classical theater with physical minimalism and intellectual complexity. At the same time that I was going to the theater in Paris every week, I was also taking acting classes and performing to see the differences between the old and the new.       Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco (1909 \u2013 28 March 1994) was a Romanian and French playwright and dramatist, and one of the foremost playwrights of the Theater of the Absurd. Beyond ridiculing the most banal situations, Ionesco's plays depict in a tangible way the solitude and insignificance of human existence.    Collections of The Bald Soprano, The Lesson, and The Chairs (1950-1951) are excellent introductions to the Theater of the Absurd. As a dramatist, Ionesco is\u00a0superb. Don't be deceived by his simplicity as his work is deep, not dumbed-down, and he plays terrific language games in The Lesson.\u00a0He admired Dadaists and Surrealists more than\u00a0Marxists. \u00a0    \u00a0    We produced Le Roi Se Meurt or Exit the King (1962) \u00a0and as a young girl of nineteen, it changed my way of thinking. As the king dies, he learns to savor each second of his dying day. As I sat drinking cafe au lait in the literary cafes of the Quartier Latin, I learned the true meaning of existentialism--to milk each moment for its unique existence, but\u00a0I, like Sartre and even Saadawi, prefer the responsibility\u00a0to other as opposed to wrestling too\u00a0much with the absurdity of existence.    Genet    Samuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 \u2013 22 December 1989) was an Irish writer, dramatist, and poet, writing in English and French. Beckett's work offers a bleak outlook on human culture and both formally and philosophically became increasingly\u00a0minimalist in his later career.    As a student, assistant, and friend of\u00a0James Joyce,\u00a0Beckett is considered one of the last modernists; as an inspiration to many later writers, he is sometimes considered one of the first postmodernists. He is also considered one of the key writers in what Martin Esslin\u00a0called Theater of the Absurd. As such, he is widely regarded as among the most influential writers of the 20th century.Beckett was awarded the 1969\u00a0Nobel Prize in Literature\u00a0&quot;for his writing, which\u2014in new forms for the novel and drama\u2014in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation.&quot;       Most of you may have seen Waiting for Godot (1953) or even Endgame (1957) and Krapp's Last Tape (1958) but he was also a significant literary critic, author of prose and poetry, and writer of the new media of radio and television.          Jean Genet (1910-1986)) was a prominent and controversial French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist.\u00a0Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but later took to writing. His major works include the novels\u00a0 The Thief's Journal and Our Lady of the Flowers\u00a0and the plays The Balcony, The Blacks, The Maids, and The Screens. Unlike some of the writers with bourgeois backgrounds, Genet's mother was a prostitute who put him up for adoption. He spent his life in and out of prison and was persecuted for his homosexuality. But his writing saved him as he created a unique literary legacy.    \u00a0       Edward Albee, the American playwright, is also occasionally considered part of this movement.          Act out these plays with friends and family to savor the Theater of the Absurd. You need minimal costumes and sets as these plays are designed to appeal to the intellect and make you question the absurdity of our existence.                      German Existentialism                                  Franz Kafka (1883-1924) Although Kafka finished his novella The Metamorphosis, he requested that all his other works be burned when he died. Isn't this the epitome of self-censorship, or did he succumb to the angst that is implicit and explicit in his works? Now his legacy includes a vast assortment of novels, stories, and essays. I recommend the Metamorphosis, The Trial, and The Penal Colony. See how you feel at the end of these works and compare that to how you feel at the end of a typical American transformative drama with a happy ending. No wonder we now have the adjective &quot;kafkaesque&quot; to describe this feeling. Also contrast this literature with your Wiki research on Hitler's Germany and the propaganda literature on the Fascist states that make people feel all is right in the rosy world ruled by the dictator. Does introspection and exploration of self always lead to angst?     \u00a0     Thomas Mann, (1875-1955) This ambitious writer won the Nobel Prize in     I recommend the novella Death in Venice (1912) and The Magic Mountain (1924). Not only is he wonderful at painting his world and getting inside his characters' heads, but he also reaches into contemporary themes of literature and medicine, tourism, and the global world. His work is rich and deep enough to span all movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.     \u00a0     How do these German existentialists compare to the French? Is there any analogy in music and art?                              Contemporary European Writers                                              Jean-Marie Gustave Le Cl\u00e9zio (born 13 April 1940), usually identified as J. M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio , is a French author and professor. The author of over forty works, he was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature as an &quot;author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization.&quot;       \u00a0       As he writes about his wide travels and hybrid cultures, he embraces post-colonial and ecoliterary themes in a lucid, precise, poetic\u00a0style that is still more accessible than the modernists. I recommend The Desert, The Interrogation, Wandering Star, and Spring and Other Seasons.       \u00a0       He also writes books for children and travel essays.       \u00a0                                        \u00a0        Post 9/11 criticism is a burgeoning field in the twenty-first century, marked by the study of literature and terrorism, American exceptionalism, torture, censorship, global conflicts and disparities, and depiction of the other. Although it can include some discussion of the environment, it is more of an offshoot of Marxism than eco-poetics and tends to look at nature in terms of petromodernity, the\u00a0power and politics\u00a0of the fossil fuels. In books like The Kindly Ones, the German Mujahid, and The Patience Stone, there is also an imaginative depiction of the other, the role-playing and assumption of a narrative voice at odds with the author's own persona. For example, an Afghan male takes on the voice of a repressed Taliban female, an Algerian army officer makes the controversial analogy between the Islamists and the Nazis as he assumes the voice of two brothers investigating the shady, secret past of their Nazi father turned Mujahid and killed by the Islamists, and a New York Jew writes in French in the voice of an SS officer during the holocaust.    \u00a0    This area is best explored in Professor Keefer's Major New York authors course as well as her Journal on Terrorism or Unclashing Civilizations but it's good to have an overview of it in our global literature course.                                      \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}, {"content": "%PDF-1.3 %  1 0 obj  >  endobj 2 0 obj [  /PDF
