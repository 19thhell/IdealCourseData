It is axiomatic that an examination of a specific culture or period of history will deepen one\u2019s understanding of the literature produced in that culture, especially works that are presumed \u201cto reflect\u201d the period. However, in recent decades interdisciplinary inquiry has turned to literature to study culture and, more specifically, how a fictional work interprets, reinforces, challenges and shapes culture. New Historicist critic Stephen Greenblatt coined this approach the \u201cPoetics of Culture\u201d to denote the interaction between literary production and other social practices, to bridge the divide between literary and non-literary texts, and to blur the distinctions between that which is \u201cwithin a text\u201d and that \u201cwhich lies outside.\u201d In addition to reading historical novels, documentary fiction, and docudrama, we will bring a historical and cultural analysis to literary works that seem a world apart from political conflicts, history-making events, or even daily life as we imagine it. Readings will juxtapose fiction and film with contemporary non-literary texts, including historical documents, essays, and journalistic accounts. The readings will serve as sources for critical essays that will lead to a final research project. Class time will also be devoted to identifying a research question, locating source materials, incorporating sources into a clearly developed argument, and reading drafts in the revision process. Readings may include texts by Toni Morrison, Stephen Crane, Kate Chopin, Norman Mailer, James Baldwin, and Emily Mann.

It is axiomatic that an examination of a specific culture or period of history will deepen one\u2019s understanding of the literature produced in that culture, especially works that are presumed \u201cto reflect\u201d the period. However, in recent decades interdisciplinary inquiry has turned to literature to study culture and, more specifically, how a fictional work interprets, reinforces, challenges and shapes culture. New Historicist critic Stephen Greenblatt coined this approach the \u201cPoetics of Culture\u201d to denote the interaction between literary production and other social practices, to bridge the divide between literary and non-literary texts, and to blur the distinctions between that which is \u201cwithin a text\u201d and that \u201cwhich lies outside.\u201d In addition to reading historical novels, documentary fiction, and docudrama, we will bring a historical and cultural analysis to literary works that seem a world apart from political conflicts, history-making events, or even daily life as we imagine it. Readings will juxtapose fiction and film with contemporary non-literary texts, including historical documents, essays, and journalistic accounts. The readings will serve as sources for critical essays that will lead to a final research project. Class time will also be devoted to identifying a research question, locating source materials, incorporating sources into a clearly developed argument, and reading drafts in the revision process. Readings may include texts by Toni Morrison, Stephen Crane, Kate Chopin, Norman Mailer, James Baldwin, and Emily Mann.
