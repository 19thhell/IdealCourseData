Teaching Statement: Poet and cultural arbiter Ezra Pound once defined literature as \u201cnews that stays new.\u201d My teaching hews closely to Pound\u2019s proclamation. I ask students to project themselves into classic texts, pictures, and films, in order to see these worlds from the points of view of their characters, including the author; and thus to understand the characters\u2019 choices in the light of the options available to them. Although I am obsessed with dependence of meaning on historical context, what ultimately renders a work canonical\u2014i.e., not boring\u2014for me is the force with which it escapes preconceived notions, the way it sabotages systems of political dominance (such as morality or utility) to show the tragedy and slapstick of being human.
