The mission of the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Veterans Center is to accelerate the discovery of measurable medical characteristics, known as biomarkers, that would allow health care professionals to objectively diagnose post-traumatic stress (PTS) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) in veterans.   Our team is dedicated to lessening the burden of these conditions on service members, veterans, and their families. We aim to improve the detection and treatment of PTS and TBI through cutting-edge research.   Study Participation for Veterans and Active Duty Service Members   We are currently conducting a research study to determine how to better diagnose PTS, TBI, and depression in veterans and active duty service members. No treatment is given as part of this study, but the results will help guide the care of veterans and service members in the future.   We are looking for participants who:   Served in Iraq or Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and/or Operation New Dawn   Are male or female veterans or active duty service members   Have proof of military service (DD214 or military ID)   All information collected is confidential and will not be shared with anyone outside the research team.
