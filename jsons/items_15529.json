curriculum asks students to grapple with profound and enduring questions about the human and social condition as well as the natural world, and helps students develop essential intellectual skills. Students in core classes explore varied modes of thinking and human creativity from science and technology to literature and music. Students consider the range of cultural traditions in relation to one another and probe basic questions about the meaning of life and our place in the world. Core courses also provide students the opportunity to improve foundational skills in writing, public speaking, close reading, analysis, and quantitative reasoning.     The NYUAD core curriculum is distin\u00adguished by its cross-cultural perspective. The idea of a core curriculum was devel\u00adoped in the early 20th century with a focus on Western civilization. Rethought for the 21st century, the NYUAD core focuses on the books, ideas, and experiences that have been \u2014 and continue to be \u2014 central to different cultural traditions. These classes are enriched by the varied international backgrounds and experiences of the students at NYUAD, who exchange their ideas and challenge one another in dynamic discussions. Through such classes, students cultivate tolerance and respect for classmates with different values and points of view. Overall, the core curriculum fosters the deeper global understanding that is one hallmark of an NYUAD undergraduate education.   Guiding Principles   The guiding principles of the core curriculum include:     Small classes: 10\u201315 students   Sustained interaction with faculty   Seminars based on discussion   Cross-cultural perspectives   Big ideas and transformative works of human thought and invention   Significant emphasis on writing       The core curriculum is organized into four areas. Students are required to take two courses in each area, for a total of eight courses. The courses in the core curriculum vary from semester to semester, with extensive choices in each area. core courses may be taken over four years; however, in the first two years, students must take at least five core courses (four courses for Engineering majors), and at least one course in each area. Students who complete Foundations of Science 1 fulfill the requirement for Experimental Discovery in the Natural World, but are welcome to take EDNW courses.                               Core Curriculum Areas                                       Expand all [+] Collapse all [-]                                      CORE 1: PATHWAYS OF WORLD LITERATURE            Pathways of World Literature introduces students to significant works of literature in different cultural traditions and involves close reading and discussion of primary texts. Courses focus on abiding themes and questions, and examine a range of literary forms, including novels, poetry and drama. A defining feature of Pathways of World Literature is the emphasis on encounters and exchanges between cultural spheres and the exploration of tradition, transmission, and translation within and across these spheres. The approach is comparative: courses examine topics and genres across space and time, consider the historical depth and geographical spread of literature, and explore conversations between classical and modern literature.                                 CORE 2: STRUCTURES OF THOUGHT AND SOCIETY            Structures of Thought and Society introduces students to historical and contemporary thought about values, social organizations, political systems, economic arrangements, and belief systems across different societies and cultural traditions. Courses are based on major texts and explore key themes, such as justice, individuality, divinity, truth, and the state. Readings range from Plato and Confucius to Ibn Khaldun, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud. Courses may stress moral reasoning and ethical arguments or incorporate a more empirical approach, grounded in the statistical methodology of the social sciences.                                 CORE 3: ART, TECHNOLOGY AND INVENTION            Art, Technology and Invention draws material from various cultural traditions and from a wide range of genres and media, including architecture, painting, sculpture, photography, theater, music, cinema, and television. Art is a mode of knowledge that arises through the transformation of raw materials, such as sounds, objects, images, and the human body, into representational and expressive forms via the passionate yet disciplined exercise of the imagination. It offers an understanding of self and the world that embraces ambiguity, complexity, and innovation. It also opens avenues to engage with the rapid development of science, technology, and communication that is transforming 21st-century society and culture. These courses stimulate students to make connections between different practices and traditions as well as to understand their unique idioms and histories. They also train students to incorporate creative methods and habits of reflection into work in their chosen fields of specialization.                                 CORE 4: IDEAS AND METHODS OF SCIENCE            Ideas and Methods of Science introduces students to a mode of knowledge that has risen to great prominence over the past several hundred years: scientific understandings of the physical world we inhabit and the living systems that occupy it. From the earliest attempts to explain the universe\u2019s origins or to ward off plagues and disease to current concerns about the welfare of our environment and future sources of energy, the natural sciences have used the scientific method to formulate experimentally testable hypotheses, to gather data and make observations, and to refine our understanding of our surroundings. Ideas and Methods of Science has two tracks: Experimental Discovery in the Natural World and Science, Society, and History. Non-science majors take one course in each track. Students who complete Foundations of Science 1 fulfill the requirement for Experimental Discovery in the Natural World, but are welcome to take these courses.   Experimental Discovery in the Natural World (EDNW) focuses on fundamental scientific concepts and phenomena, with a special emphasis on science as a process. All courses in this track have a project-based laboratory component. In the lab component, students practice the experimental or scientific method: they develop hypotheses, design experiments to test those hypotheses, gather evidence, and incorporate that evidence into an argument. Unlike labs in standard science courses, EDNW labs are focused more on the heuristic process of experimentation than on mastery of a particular topic. They pose a series of fundamental questions about experimentation, evidence, and proof: What are observations? What are data? How do you determine if data are robust or weak? Are there different ways to present data, and how do you use them in arguments? What is a valid experiment? What constitutes proof, and what is required in order to disprove a hypothesis?   Science, Society, and History explores the relations between the knowledge, theories, and technical practices of scientists, engineers, medical researchers, physicians and lay people, and the local and global contexts in which they operate. Courses ask critical questions about the definition of the various sciences, their history, and how they work in practice; the basis of scientific authority and challenges to it; scientific revolutions; how ethical and political decisions are made about scientific regulation and applications; and how changes in science relate to larger intellectual, cultural, social, political, economic, and environmental trends as well as public policies.                                                All Students are required to take one core course with a Writing Workshop, typically in the first year. Standard core courses meet twice a week; those with a Writing Workshop meet three times a week. The courses with Writing Workshops are designated by the \u201cW\u201d suffix in the course number. (Students who take Analysis and Expression may defer the Writing Workshop core course until their second year.) The small size of core courses and their emphasis on discussion enable students to practice and improve their ability to articulate ideas clearly, cogently, and persuasively. core courses with Writing Workshops establish a solid foundation for more demanding writing assignments in upper-level electives as well as for Capstone projects.   Below is a list of the many core courses that have been offered. Not all are offered every year.

We begin by discussing the voice&rsquo;s relationship to the body (both in terms of anatomy and contemporary discourse  on &ldquo;embodiment&rdquo;) and to a number of technologies, from amplification to autotune. In the second half of the course, we focus in on the salience of voice  within the experimental music scene in New York. Perhaps most importantly, we treat our class as an experimental vocal collective, composing and performing together throughout the term. No prior musical experience is necessary, but a willingness to make vocal sounds in public is required.

COREA-AD 03 Instruments of World Cultures                                             Musical instruments have been created by humans for at least 35,000 years. How do diverse musical cultures view the significance of the sounds and playing techniques of musical instruments? From instrumental story-telling in Siberia, Central Asian shaman-bards, dervish flutes, folk, Gypsy and classical fiddling, dulcimers, psalteries and keyboards to drumming in several parts of the world, the course examines why musical cultures need instruments; how these instruments interact with or take the place of vocal music; where they are connected to dance and where they have evolved far from dance; how diverse cultures attribute positive or negative moral values to different instruments and their players; and how a single musical culture may feel the need to exchange, develop or exclude particular musical instruments over time.

COREA-AD 04J Gardens of Eden                                             The Garden of Eden haunts the history of the peoples of the Book&mdash;Jews, Christians, Muslims&mdash;as primal site of creation, bounty, betrayal, and loss, as spur to repentance and redemption, as preview of heaven and model of earthly Utopia. The exile of Adam and Eve from the garden that God planted for the first man and filled with all the Earth's creatures and plants set their descendants on an infinite quest to find, describe, and recreate it. The course studies the efforts by people of the Abrahamic religions to specify the site, form, and meaning of the first Garden, in theology, literature, visual art, film, and garden design. It seeks convergences and differences among these interpretations across millennia and media, and ask whether the Garden of Eden continues to hold productive meanings today. All students participate in a garden design project. This course includes field trips to gardens in Abu Dhabi and abroad.

Taught by a collaborative artist, the course looks at collaboration as it has emerged from the recent history of art, literature, and science to become an essential method of contemporary social experience. Course projects and materials are based around the use of the iPad. Working with the device on creative, co-authored projects, students gain first-hand experience in considering how collaboration is structured and managed in the production of creative works and how a consideration of collaborative and interactive methods changes the way we think about the nature of the finished creative project.

Spanning several millennia and many continents, our material challenges us to think about gender, family, biology, and faith as manifestations of an attempt to reconcile human needs and desires. We work with ancient texts like the Ramayana, the Upanishads, and the Song of Songs; the poetry of Kalidasa, Rumi, and Neruda; plays by Zeami, Euripides, Shakespeare, Lorca, Tennessee Williams, and Sarah Kane; the music of PJ Harvey, Antony &amp; The Johnsons, and Thom Yorke; the photography of Cindy Sherman; and the films of David Lynch. Students move towards creating their own inventions, employing creative writing, physical improvisations, ensemble performance, and photography.

COREA-AD 10 Scapegoat                                             The scapegoat, however unwillingly, has played a role in human culture since the earliest times. This course examines the phenomena of scapegoating from both a historical and psychological perspective, and examines its treatment in films, literature, music, and new technology. Tracing the origins of scapegoating as a tribal rite and as one of the defining aspects of Greek tragedy, this course ultimately poses the question&mdash;what is it, in the human psyche, that causes us to demonize and dehumanize the &ldquo;other,&rdquo; and demand, in the most extreme cases, witch trials throughout the centuries, mob lynchings, the Holocaust, and the more recent genocide in Rwanda. This course also touches on the technological forms of scapegoating such as cyber-bullying and examines how the Internet itself is often used as a scapegoating device.

COREA-AD 17J Nature of Code                                             Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. No computer programming experience is required; the course starts with the basics of code using the Processing environment.

COREA-AD 19 Communication and Technology                                             From cave paintings to live video streams on smartwatches, this course will explore the development, reaction, and impact of some of humankind&#39;s most transformative inventions - its forms of communication. How have these inventions, such as writing, printing, photography, the telegraph, television, radio, and the internet, influenced human behavior throughout the course of history? What role do they play in shaping our lives today? Toward the end of the course, students will speculate on the future of communication technologies in a connected world by prototyping their own inventions and experiences. Readings and discussion will cover communication theory, technical processes, and creative applications. Writing assignments will be paired with practical assignments where students will be challenged to bring their analysis and ideas to life. We will also utilize the world wide web as a test bed for experiencing and experimenting with various forms of communication both old and new, ranging anywhere from the printing press to the 3D printer and everything in between.

COREA-AD 20 Renaissance Orientations                                             Scholarly approaches to Renaissance art have traditionally focused on what it inherited from the Roman world. What happens to our understanding of the Renaissance when we highlight its relationship to Jerusalem, Constantinople, and other cultural centers in the Eastern Mediterranean? This course investigates the interpretive implications of this shift in orientation, exploring the West&rsquo;s fascination with objects and images produced by Byzantine and Islamic artists, and the complications of identity produced by pilgrimages to the east, both real and imaginary.

COREA-AD 21 Gesture in Speech, Poetry, Music, and Dance                                                        Gesture lies at the interface of the verbal and the non-verbal in human communication and expression. Through bodily movement, intonation, and stress gesture can transcend the distinctions between normal speech, poetry, song, and dance. Gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of gesture in a variety of media across different cultures enables the student to approach fundamental means of human expression, and to learn to recognize constants in human communication within the myriad of culturally specific conventions of language, prosody, music, and dance.

COREA-AD 22 Inventions                                             Inventions have played a pivotal role in the development of history, mankind, and culture. Inventors articulate problems and find creative solutions, often by combining concepts that are not typically linked. This class examines inventions and the process of inventing through case studies. We consider the historical context of inventions and how the use of inventions can change from one culture to another. Some of the inventions we explore are the bow and arrow, the lever, the bicycle, dynamite, the fax machine, and the computer. Students are presented with problems and asked to create prototypes and invent new tools.

COREA-AD 23 Rhythm                                             Rhythm has been described as patterns of events in time and space, and is a prominent feature of life and learning. This interdisciplinary course examines what rhythm is and how it manifests itself in a wide variety of domains that range from music and the visual decorative arts traditions spanning cultures across the globe and throughout history, to how it emerges in, and is informed by, areas such as mathematics, computer science, music theory, music technology, biology, psychology, linguistics, sociology, evolution and human migrations, ethnology, crystallography, nuclear physics, calendar design, radio astronomy, architecture, computer graphics, and the visual arts. Students read from books and journal articles, solve problems, listen to music, drum with their hands on their desks, learn how to use computer software systems to analyze as well as generate rhythms, solve puzzles of musical time patterns, and write on a variety of topics. They complete an individual research project that showcases the application of knowledge in their selected discipline and culture to an open question concerned with rhythm.

COREA-AD 24 Conviction and Doubt                                             Of what can we be certain? The course explores the role of doubt throughout history and in various cultures. It will explore the capacity of doubt to endow human experience and knowledge with complexity and dimension. While belief can provide the scaffolding of a life, a community, and worldview, doubt has, throughout history, and in every part of the world, wrestled firmly held beliefs toward new invention and discovery creating pivotal moments of scientific, cultural, social and personal development. The course also focuses on the role of conviction and doubt in storytelling, examining precepts and dramatic principles that employ conviction and doubt toward a greater plurality. Through our readings and discussion students will examine the role of doubt and conviction in their daily lives. Close readings of select essays, texts, fables, koans, poetry, novels, plays, short stories and films will serve to map this exploration.

COREA-AD 27 Creativity and Innovation                                             This course will probe the heuristics of human innovation as understood by ancient and modern inventors and philosophers. The central question of this course are the following, What are the sources, requirements, and factors that influence human ingenuity? Is creativity a gift or a skill? How does creativity differ from innovation? To address these questions, we consider the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; technological innovations that affected the course of human history; and inventions that shape our modern world. Throughout the course, a strong emphasis will be placed on developing a personal philosophy and methodology for creativity.

COREA-AD 28 Fame                                             Historian Leo Braudy notes that: &ldquo;the history of fame is also the history of the shifting definition of achievement in the social world.&rdquo; We will track early discourses of heroism and immortality from Alexander the Great to today&rsquo;s reality celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Beginning with concepts of fame in antiquity, we investigate Virgil&rsquo;s The Aeneid, The Bible, Homer's The Odyssey, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Richard III. The rise of contemporary stars across film, television, and theatre raises questions about the ways in which celebrities help manage historically conditioned categories of classification, such as gender, sexuality, race, class and nationality. Case studies of non-Western celebrities, highlight the formatting of modern stardom in Asia (Jackie Chan and Jet Li), Africa (Fela Kuti), and the Middle East (Umm Kulthum).

COREA-AD 29 Performing Body in History                                             This class examines the representation and theorization of the human body as evident in acting theory and performance practices. We will be particularly attentive to the international circulation of ideas of the body. To what extent are the commentaries of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) on Galen and Plato important to Renaissance Europe&rsquo;s understanding of the performing body? How has Tadashi Suzuki&rsquo;s interest in Noh, Kabuki, and Ancient Greek theatre informed his collaborations with major figures of the European theatre? Authors will include: Ibn Rushd, Plato, Zeami, Shakespeare, Diderot, Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Brecht, Suzuki.

COREA-AD 30W Representations                                             This course will consider representations of social and historical realities within which notions of cultural identity, citizenship and power are imagined and presented. Using examples from the performing arts, film and photography, we explore formal technologies of creating representations and cultural modes of interpreting them, and compare how reality is abstracted and codified by representations from different parts of the world. Some of the examples are films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Mother India, Xala and Al Za&rsquo;eem; plays such as The Road, Al-Malik huwa I-Malik, and St Joan; photographs by Annie Liebovitz, Brian Duffy and Yousef Karsh. Basic semiotic, materialist and reception theories will offer prisms for our study. Key essays such as Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for the Pastness of India by Dipesh Charkravorty, Fictions of the Pose by Harry Berger, Imperialist Nostalgia by Renato Rosaldo, and Theorizing the Male Gaze by Edward Snow are read side by side videos of performances, films and slides of photographs.

COREA-AD 31W Machine Dreams                                             Machines have provided the means for artists to dream different worlds into existence. Machines impact how we structure our thoughts, our language, and even our bodies. We will examine how writers, visual artists, filmmakers and performers have creatively engaged both obsolete and emerging technologies&mdash;mirrors, camera obscuras, phonographs, photocopiers, projectors, telephones, computers, and satellites &mdash; to communicate shifts in how we perceive time, movement, space, similarity and difference among human beings, and operations of political power. We will study a variety of philosophers, scientists, anthropologists, cultural theorists, visual artists and playwrights including Horace, Euripides, Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Michael Taussig, David Hockey, Ingres, Vermeer, Caravaggio, Chuck Close, films by the Lumiere Brothers and Jean Rouch, Apple Computer television commercials, and web-based performance/installation art by Stelarc, Electronic Disturbance Theatre, Emily Jacir, and Ai Weiwei.

COREA-AD 32 Identity: Text, Image, and Place                                             The course explores how image-based representations, written texts, and aspects of the built environment reflect certain conceptions of identity. The course considers paintings, photographs, video, ego documents, and journals. We will focus on artistic practices that examine and/or demonstrate personal or preconceived notions of identity through acts of self-representation. Our questions include: Why do artists from a particular region privilege certain issues over others? What extenuating circumstances may influence an artist's practice? How do artists consider Identity through examination of place? What role does gender or gendered stereotypes play in the production of art? How do artists represent themselves in order to challenge gender or cultural stereotypes?   \u2028We explore several media and methods of self-representation in artistic practice. Basic visual criticism techniques and theory is introduced in order to understand and differentiate between a wide range of artistic practices and intentions. The course considers artists from the USA, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and includes visits to local galleries and artist studios.

COREA-AD 33 Perception in Music and Sound                                             What is perception and how is it mediated by culture and technology? To what extent do objects of perception look and sound the same across individuals, cultures, and means of representation? How much of music is a function of the way our auditory system works and how much is learned as a part of culture? This class approaches these questions by looking at the scientific literature (to understand the basics of perception), by examining cultural objects such as musical instruments, scales, and performances (for specific examples that bring the ideas into focus) and by contrasting the various technologies for storing and reproducing sound.   * Please note the duration of this course during summer 2013 is 26 May-20 June     Prerequisites : None.

Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music.

COREA-AD 35 Lies and Lying                                             Lying is an integral part of human communication. It is only in contrast to lies that we are able to construct the concept of truth and &ldquo;choose&rdquo; our perception of reality. From white lies and exaggerations to advanced techniques of persuasion such as propaganda and brainwashing, this course will examine the psychological, philosophical, ethical and social aspects of several contexts in which lying commonly occurs: Art, Culture, Literature, Science, Politics, Advertising, Journalism, Relationships, Digital World and History. We will discuss and analyze the motives, techniques, technology and outcomes of some of the biggest lies and liars throughout history, from mythological gods in ancient Greece through fake alchemists in the Islamic Golden Age to contemporary schemers. We will study examples of lying in texts, films, biographies, cartography, visual arts, internet, social networking, mass media, advertisement as well as guest liars and lying experts.

COREA-AD 36W Death: Myths, Histories, Metamorphoses                                             Death is a universal fact of human life, powerfully defining the exigencies of our experience. From ancient times until the present, artistic works have registered changing attitudes towards death in the stories they tell. In this seminar, we will examine artistic responses to mortality across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts&mdash;including in the myths of Orpheus and Osiris, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the text of the Ramayana; the poetry of Darwish, Neruda, and Rilke; stories by Tolstoy, Mishima, and Benjamin; and music of Dowland, Wagner, and Adams. Selected films and plays, including the Noh Drama of Japan, also are considered. Students develop a collaborative or individual artistic project and related critical paper demonstrating their engagement with the topic.

COREA-AD 37W Staging the Self                                             This course will examine the representation of personal experience in its biographical and autobiographical forms in the arts with a focus on performance. We pay particular attention to the ways in which personhood is aesthetically, psychologically, and politically theorized in different contexts. What does an individual&rsquo;s experience represent in specific art works? How is the relationship of individual experience to collective experience reconstructed in different arts works? Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist&rsquo;s oeuvre in relation to their personal life? In what ways do individual art works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities? Texts for the course include works by Irving Goffman, Errol Morris, Erik Erikson, Joseph Roach, Freddie Rokem, Deirdre Heddon, and selected plays, films and museum displays.

COREA-AD 38J Memory                                             Memory is a dynamic process influenced by internal and external factors. Internally, a person&rsquo;s individual memory content is overwritten each and every time something is remembered. Externally, memory is determined by social practices and, not least, our physical environment, shaping what may be called social or collective memory. The stability of the physical environment is a guarantor of an individual&rsquo;s memory and, by implication, identity, to a much greater extent than individual memory itself; it was as early as 2000 years ago that the nexus of the urban space and a stable memory was established (Cicero, Quintilian). The class will focus on theoretical concepts of memory in the fields of the arts, technology and invention in antiquity and the 20th century (Warburg, Halbwachs, Nora), discuss a novel that satirically memoriZes the fall of the Wall (Brussig) and provide numerous field trips that exemplify the concepts of social/collective memory based upon the urban space of Berlin (the replacement of the GDR Palace of the Republic by a reconstructed City Palace, Holocaust Memorial, Sinti and Roma Memorial, Jewish Museum, book burning memorial, Berlin Wall, Berlin Museums, the 3rd Reich Germania project).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREA-AD 39 Tools                                             We are habituated to think of tools as physical objects that facilitate utilitarian actions. Pencils, glassware, and hammers are tools of this type. However, the definition of a tool can be expanded beyond material objects, to include things like storytelling and the internet. Tools can facilitate interpersonal interactions and enable intimate communication, yet have no physical manifestation. This course studies the invention and use of tools across cultures and time. We examine a large number of examples, starting with languages, moving through tools like the wheel and metalwork to modern tools like software and network topologies, asking how our choice of tools changes the way we think about our goals.

COREA-AD 40 Records                                             What drives us to create records of human events or experience? And how has that drive shaped not only the history of human communication but of record-keeping itself? What is the relationship between an event and the records or recordings we make of it? Is there tension between the promise of mimetic or documentary fidelity and new possibilities for art and imagination? When is the memorializing goal better served by invention than recording? This course will examine a series of technological innovations in record-keeping and record-making, from cuneiform to cassette culture, mp3s, and beyond. Readings will address histories and theories of orality and literacy, archives, print, photography, film, sound recording, and other media as we explore fundamental questions about memory, history, technology, and the relationship between art and life.    Please note: Summer 2014 exams will be held on Saturday June 21.

COREA-AD 41 Nomads                                             What can the unique human ecology and worldview that emerges from mobile ways of life teach us about human ingenuity and culture? This course uses the lenses of philosophy, art, and design to examine the history, influence, and cultural underpinnings of nomadism and nomadic dwelling. Paying special attention to kinetic objects and the built environment, we will probe historical and contemporary conceptions of ownership and ecology, transience and permanence, home and homelessness, and citizenship and belonging. We will study writings by Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, and Rosi Braidotti, artworks by Andrea Zittel, Lucy Orta, and Krzysztof Wodiczko and cinematic works including Lawrence of Arabia and Dances with Wolves. All aspects of mobile dwellings, from familiar vernacular models such as tents and huts to developments in humanitarian design and contemporary art, will be considered. Students will be presented with a series of design challenges and will be asked to solve problems by creating new designs and producing prototypes. No previous background or training in design is required.

COREA-AD 42 Art and Emotion                                             While Aristotle celebrated the capacity of art to elicit emotion, Plato treated it with suspicion. Suspected of irrationality, emotion has continued to hold a contested position in the understanding of art. This course will explore the ways that art both expresses and arouses the emotions and to what value and ends. It asks how stories engage us in prototypical, emotional human situations such as suffering, separation, loss, recognition and reunion. We will think about what aspects of our emotional responses are universal, what are culturally specific, what are gendered, what are individual and personal, and the similarities and differences between art emotions and actual emotions. We will draw on a wide range of artworks from a variety of periods and cultures as case studies, including visual and narrative representations of the Passion of Christ; canonical love stories, like Laila Majnun and Romeo and Juliet; classical and modern tragedy; romantic, popular, and program music; and comic art like The Comedy of Errors and silent film comedy. These studies will be framed by the theories of, among others, Aristotle, Abhinavagupta, Tolstoy, Langer, Bergson, Freud, analytic philosophy (Carroll, Kivy), and cognitive theory (Hogan).

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

COREA-AD 44 Time                                             This course explores the multifaceted nature of time, in different historical, social and religious contexts. We will pursue three main strands: 1) changing conceptions of time, time-keeping systems, and states of time consciousness from antiquity to the present; 2) representations of time in works of art that heighten our apprehension of time or aim to escape the rule of time and induce a quality of timeless suspension; and 3) the technologies of time-keeping from sundials to atomic watches, calendars to timelines. Denaturalizing our own conventions of keeping time, we will consider the purposes of time measurement, the history of the hour, the development of the mechanical clock and its impact on society, the relationship between clock time and industrialization, the shift from local to international standard time, and the question whether the human experience of time is common across cultures or is culturally specific and variable.

An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course examines the role of technologies ranging from print, cave painting, comics, animation, and film, to hypertext, social media, and viral video. In addition to reading and viewing, the assignments will also include creative technological projects and excursions to the Museum of Moving Image, the Museum of Comics Art, and The Moth storytelling theater.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Topics include debates about the listening subject in Western philosophy and media studies; the role of the &lsquo;ethnographic ear&rsquo; in cultural anthropology and ethnomusicology; theories and methods of &lsquo;soundscape research&rsquo; and &lsquo;acoustemology&rsquo;; and aurality as an aspect of culture, explored through case studies ranging from the development of sound reproduction technologies, to deaf culture, to the ethics of sounding and listening in religious practice. Course readings, drawn from a wide range of disciplines, include foundational texts in the emerging interdisciplinary field of &lsquo;sound studies&rsquo;. In addition to engaging critically with a range of ideas and debates through discussion, presentations, and writing, students will try their ears at specialized modes of training and data collection developed by sound-oriented researchers and artists.

COREA-AD 48 Vision                                             This seminar concerns the phenomenon of vision. The sense of vision is closely related to processes of understanding, thought, and linguistic interpretation. Seeing is an activity in which the eye and brain work together, but the imagination also affects vision, for we sometimes imagine what we say we see. We will study the connection of image and language using the example of Hollis Frampton&rsquo;s film Nostalgia, which suggests that vision entails an aspect of imagining. We will approach questions about the nature of vision on the basis of texts, cinematic materials, art works, and experiments we conduct. The texts on which we will work include &ldquo;classical&rdquo; ones by authors such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, but also more recent theoretical approaches by Serge Daney, for example. We will also focus on the phenomenon of synaesthesia as it is emphasized as &lsquo;haptic seeing&rsquo; in the work of Lygia Clark.

COREA-AD 49 Collecting                                             What motivates human beings to form collections? How do we select, order, preserve and display information and objects? And, what intellectual processes are involved in these activities? What does the content of these collections say about those who created them? And, what kind of narratives can be traced within the display of these collections? This course surveys the phenomenon of collecting, focusing on key moments in its history, from antiquity up to contemporary times. In the first section of the class, we explore collections of &ldquo;thought,&rdquo; that is, how knowledge has been stored, organized and retrieved &ndash; and some of the tools we have developed to do so &ndash; including mnemonic devices, writing, codices, libraries, information architecture and digital technologies. The second section concerns physical objects, and their collection, classification, organization, and display. Finally, we discuss the work of modern and contemporary artists who incorporate concepts of assemblage and curation. In response to the readings and to the materials covered in class, students will conceive, create, describe and display a collection of their own making.

COREA-AD 50W Identity and Object                                             This course asks how objects from the past obtain meaning long after they were made, and how they have come to express the identity of communities, nations, and religions. We will consider fundamental questions of identity by assessing how objects become imbued with meaning. Who ascribes these objects meaning and why? How do we relate to objects designated to represent us? We will explore object biographies from a range of periods, regions and traditions. We will discuss objects representing contested national and global identities, such as the Cyrus Cylinder from Iraq, and the Koh-i-noor diamond from India, as well as material that facilitates discussion of socially and culturally defined identities. In all of these examples politics plays a constant role. Through case studies of iconic objects from around the world, we will compare significance in the originating society with place and function today to better understand how, why, and by whom identity is constructed.

COREA-AD 51 Wood                                             Wood is inseparably linked to human history and culture. From mankind&rsquo;s earliest use of sticks for shelter, warmth and gathering food, the increasingly complex ways that we have used and understood this material reflect the history of civilization itself. What can wood can teach us about ecology, human history, ingenuity and culture? By examining wood&#39;s role across several diverse cultures, this class will consider our ever evolving relationship to wood through its use in architecture, art and design. We will study the work of artists and designers including Richard Deacon, Koki Tanaka, Louise Bourgeois, Giuseppe Penone, Bill Reid, Charles and Ray Eames, El Anatsui, Henry Moore, and Ai Weiwei. We will also examine the lore and mythology of wood through literary works like the Epic of Gilgamesh, Hermann Hesse&rsquo;s Siddhartha, Shel Silverstein&rsquo;s The Giving Tree, Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce&rsquo;s Flaming Green Tree Trilogy, Betty Smith&rsquo;s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, the Enchanted Forests of the Brothers Grimm, J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings, and Michael Pollan&rsquo;s Botany of Desire. The class will include a practical studio component in which students learn historic and contemporary woodworking techniques, respond to carpentry design challenges, and develop a kinesthetic knowledge and materials understanding through the exploration and manipulation of wood and wood-based materials. No previous background or training is required.

COREA-AD 52 Play                                             We are engaged in play throughout our lives. It socializes and engages us in a deeply meaningful way that serves as an essential component of our education in the world. Beginning with the imaginative and open-ended games of our childhood, and continuing through more structured aspects of play like sport, theatre, board and video games, it serves a vital tool in our development as individuals. It can be collaborative or competitive, open-ended or closed, but always is innately fun. Examining the topic from a variety of perspectives, including psychological, artistic and philosophical, we will engage with multiple levels of playfulness throughout history, from simple childhood escapism to urban scale games facilitated by new technologies . Students will be challenged to create new forms of play by prototyping and designing their own games and frameworks for play throughout the semester.

COREA-AD 53 Abjection                                             How do we build an identity? What is rejected or expelled from us? This fundamental aspect of the human condition underlies the notion of abjection: a detached, degraded state, or the act of causing it. The abject, renounced in oneself or cast out of society, takes various forms from the maternal body and the corpse to social minorities and refugees. It implies some trauma or taboo that disturbs the symbolic order of law and norms. This course asks how abjection occurs on many levels and also catalyzes new modes of life and community. We trace it in terms of love, beauty, horror, disgust, sexuality, labor, multiculturalism, terrorism, etc., and highlight today&rsquo;s abjection that is generated in global systems and revealed through violence or catastrophe, yet also with positive potential. We explore film (Fassbinder, Sissako, Campion, Eastwood, Von Trier, Sono Shion), literature (Sophocles, Boccaccio, Kafka, Yi Sang), art and performance (Bosch, Goya, Bacon, Sherman, Zhu Yu), along with psychoanalysis, feminism, philosophy, aesthetics, and trans-historical material from myths and religions to rock music and cyber culture.

COREA-AD 56 The Idea of the Garden                                             Gardens are as diverse as cultures, but the idea of the garden is common to various cultures through the ages and across continents. What do gardens tell us about the human condition? How do gardens relate to the individual and the idea of community? How do they reflect philosophical ideas? In which ways do the real and imagined interfere with each other? Is a garden a representation of nature or culture or both? How does a garden relate to spiritual needs and sensual experience (smell, sound, sight, tactile and kinesthetic bodily feeling)? How is the idea of the garden distinguished from but related to the notion of a natural landscape? We will look at Zen-gardens and rooftop gardens, monastic and palace gardens, sculpture and pleasure gardens, mythic gardens in various religious traditions. The course is conceived as neither a historical survey nor typological compilation but chooses diverse examples of gardens and representations of gardens from various cultures and historical periods in order to reflect on the ways in which gardens reflect the human condition.

COREA-AD 57 Touch                                             It is easy to have an idea of the effects of significant loss of vision or hearing by closing our eyes or by wearing earplugs. What about a significant loss of the sense of touch? What would that be like? The answer might not come readily due in part to the subtle, effortless performance of the sense of touch. Far from being just an immediate skin sensation, touching is intimately blended into embodied experiences that are affectionate, expressive, personal and interpersonal. Indeed, the haptic modality is the fundamental mode of access to the physical properties of the world. This course provides a multidisciplinary, cross-cultural introduction to the dynamics and salience of the human sense of touch, and runs a continuous thread for a number of fundamental questions and critical approaches that twenty-first-century haptic scholars embrace. A wide variety of interpretations, disciplines and experiences exploring the symbolic, cultural, ethical, social and technical aspects of haptic communication will be discussed. Topics covered in this course include social and cultural development, memory, learning, digital design, experiences of visual impairment, tactile therapies, human computer interaction, multimodal interaction and sensory substitution, funneling illusion and apparent motion, and privacy and security.

COREI-AD 10 Quantum Theory and Relativity: The Impact of a Scientific Revolution                                             At the beginning of the 20th century, a scientific revolution started that was destined to change radically the way we think about the physical world. Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public&rsquo;s everyday experiences and intuition. Challenging that notion of inaccessibility, this course analyzes some of the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory.

Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world&#39;s lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.

How do programs (software applications) make computers behave intelligently and allow them to solve problems effectively for a wide range of applications and fields, from art and other media to education, medicine, and the core sciences? How do we use computer programs to process, structure, and manage information, create and manipulate digital media, and search and gather information relevant to any particular topic? How do computer programs operate virtually, creating the World Wide Web of the modern digital age, and how does all of this effect issues related to security and privacy in the wired world we live in today? Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project. The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities. This course is intended for students from different disciplines (outside the sciences); no prerequisite is needed.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

Perhaps such fear is warranted since many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cancer, are caused by &ldquo;mutations&rdquo;, which are mere changes in the genetic information in DNA. Starting with basic concepts, this course explores important cellular macromolecules, such as DNA, and proteins as well as their three-dimensional structures that endow them with their specific functions. In fact, understanding how mutations induce alterations to macromolecular structures often sheds light on the characteristic symptoms and prognoses of some human diseases and syndromes. Laboratory projects, which focus on introduction to computer modeling, emphasize visualizing in a three-dimensional environment the normal and altered macromolecules associated with some common but complex human maladies.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 15 Microbes                                             Microbes are tiny organisms that are found on every imaginable surface and habitat. This complex myriad can consist of microbes that are essential to a healthy life, as well as microbes that cause infectious diseases in plants and animals, which may also contribute to many chronic diseases and conditions, such as cancer and environmentally-related diseases. To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 16 Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments                                                                              Over half of the human population lives within 100km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the worlds largest cities. As a result, the world&#39;s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to explain the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globaly and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 17 Domain of Crystals                                             Knowing the three-dimensional structure of a molecule is important for understanding its functional properties. Is it indeed possible to visually analyze a molecule and use the observed experimental data to build a three-dimensional model? This structural information can be obtained using a variety of analytical techniques such as X-ray crystallography, and can lead to significant breakthroughs in pharmaceutics. Students grow crystals of different colors, shapes, and sizes and harvest them for physical and morphological characterization in order to understand the basic principles of atomic structure and theory, chemical bonding and reactions, thermochemistry, periodicity, and solution chemistry.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

When the gene was discovered and our ability to manipulate it became apparent, a whole new era in science began. Scientists wanted to understand the power that hides in the gene and the effects of its manipulation. The Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003 led to the identification of the genes in the Human DNA. This discovery is now leading the way to trying to understand the roles of those genes in our bodies, the diseases that may result from their malfunctioning, and consequently treating those diseases at the gene level. This growing field is known as Gene Therapy. In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy. This course travels through the world of genetics and examines the Human Genome Project, successful stories and challenges in the field of Gene Therapy, Genetically Modified Foods, and Cloning; all being topics that have fundamental implications on the society that will live in and contribute towards.

COREI-AD 21S Serendipity in Science                                             In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale &ldquo;The Three Princes of Serendip,&rdquo; whose heroes &ldquo;were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.&rdquo; In the ensuing centuries, the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improve our standard of living.

COREI-AD 22S Trust, Risk, and Deception in Cyberspace                                             Cyberspace is playing an increasing role in our lives, and our society is rapidly becoming structured around the 24/7 availability and trustworthiness of information systems. We already entrust cyberspace with our privacy, national security, physical safety, and digital identities. Maintaining an orderly, peaceful, safe, and productive society will increasingly depend on maintaining trust in information systems. However, trust cannot be realized by technology alone. This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is essentially a social system that relies on important technical components. The course will begin with a discussion of trust, risk and deception as developed in the social sciences and examine how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. In the second part of the course we will examine the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms that have been developed to create trustworthy systems. In the third and final part of the course we will examine the interplay between the technical and social aspects and see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar and cyberterrorism. A computer science or engineering knowledge is not necessary for taking this course.

COREI-AD 24J Heuristics                                             Many problems in science, business, and politics require heuristics -- problem solving techniques that often work well even if not perfectly. This course teaches heuristics as they have applied in the design of scientific experiments, the solution of problems global power politics, and in the resolution of economic negotiations. While being exposed to heuristic techniques, students work in small teams that compete with one another to design strategies to solve new puzzles better than other teams. You are given computational tools as needed, but the course has no programming prerequisite. To take this course, you should love to think both qualitatively and quantitatively. Among the specific problems we will tackle include the design of currencies, leasing strategies for oil exploration, optimal matchmaking, and efficient experimental design. The intent is to make you better able to face complex problems in any field you choose.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

As a result, Australia&#39;s coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of Sydney, Australia&#39;s largest city, as a case study to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas worldwide. Using Sydney&#39;s terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a natural laboratory for field research, students will collect environmental data throughout the city and use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine the spatial patterns of human impacts to Sydney&#39;s environment and to compare their results with patterns observed in other coastal cities.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 29J Causality                                             When is it legitimate to conclude that A causes B? In human history, causality was sometimes the province of the gods as in there is lightening because a god is throwing bolts at the earth. The introduction of Aristotelian logic permitted the development of deductive logic and the notion of consistency. Because deduction manipulates knowledge but does not add to it, natural science uses induction in which universal causal laws are believed because of experiments at a few times and places. This course begins with a discussion of the history of the arguments for causality, then it embarks on a detailed discussion of certain great experiments and the conclusions that resulted. In the process, we discuss how the progress of science determines what is accepted as a cause, from the \"taint\" of an ancestral line to the psychological impacts of childhood. Next, we discuss the inference of causality by machine. Students will work on projects involving the construction of experiments (either ones we have discussed or others), the discovery of the laws of a simulated world that the instructor has created, and then playing a game in that world.

COREI-AD 30 The Mind                                             This course explores the perennial question, how does the mind work? We learn how philosophers, computer scientists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and linguists have answered this question. We consider several stimulating but demanding questions about the nature of the mind and try to understand how the mind enables such things as perception, thinking, and behavior. We review the historical and scientific developments the lead to the contemporary consensus that the human mind is fundamentally a computational organ and explores some of the challenges that this view poses to our common sense understanding of certain attributes, like consciousness and free will, that ascribe to ourselves as human beings.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 31S From Ancient Cosmology to Science: Chinese, Indian, and Western Traditions                                             This course considers the origins of science in ancient cosmologies. What principles are preserved? Considering the classical Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, the question of how and to what extent culture determines the paradigms of science is investigated. We begin with formative texts from the Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, including the Rig Veda, the Upanishads (India), the I Jing, Dao De Jing, and the neo-Confucian synthesis (China) and the pre-Socratic Ionian physicists (Western), then turn to the development of modern science. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read in parallel with seminal texts describing the rise of modern science in China and India. The course will conclude with a survey of contemporary cosmological theories to see how some ancient ideas are retained in modern science.

COREI-AD 32SW Global Warming and Local Weather                                             This course examines the Earth&#39;s climate and in particular how it evolved in the past and is likely to change in the future. We first consider weather patterns around the globe and ask whether the occurrence of &ldquo;weird weather&rdquo; corresponds to the emergence of worldwide disruption. Then we study physical processes, such as radiation, clouds, and wind, that are at the core of both weather and climate, and discuss how human activities can affect them. Finally, we use this understanding to consider predictions of future climate change,  the impact on different parts of the globe, possible remedies and how they might be implemented.

COREI-AD 33S Snap Judgments                                             Daily experience attests that the briefest of glances at other people often suffices to furnish a wealth of socially relevant information about them. From minimal visual cues, for instance, we can infer group memberships (e.g., sex and age), emotional states, personality traits, and even a person&rsquo;s intentions. The dexterity with which humans deduce such knowledge has fascinated ancient philosophers and contemporary thinkers alike. As a result, much thought has been dedicated towards a process that typically unfolds within less than a second. Based on this work, films, literary texts, and scientific evidence are presented to explore the perceptual, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that underlie common snap judgments in person evaluation. The accuracy of these judgments, their neural foundation, and the societal consequences of rapidly assessing others are discussed.

COREI-AD 34 From Vision to Visual                                             In 300 BC, Euclid first described Vision as the process by which rays traveled in a straight line from the eye to the object seen. Since ancient times, our curiosity about vision has propelled the invention of tools to enlarge information that could not be perceived with the naked eye and to make sense of the world around us. This course explores the development of optics and its influence on visual communication. How has our understanding of vision been communicated and changed over time? How successful have we been in &ldquo;visualizing&rdquo; the visual network that we are concurrently studying and trying to decipher? As we shed light on the visual code, we will highlight the importance of visualization tools in advancing scientific research. Has film informed or misinformed the science of visual perception and is there such a thing as the &quot;objective eye?&quot;                                                                       Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alexis Gambis                                           -             MW, 11:35-12:50                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alexis Gambis                                           -             MW, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREI-AD 35 Seven Wonders of the Invisible World                                             &ldquo;In the year of 1657 I discovered very small living creatures in rain water.&rdquo; This quote is attributed to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch merchant whose skillful use of glass lenses allowed him to peer into a world of microorganisms that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. His careful observations gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. A special emphasis will be placed on capturing images of seven wonders of the invisible world - natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins and naturally-occurring crystals.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

This course studies the strategies and campaigns currently underway on the different continents to confront this tragic reality. Along the way, students will learn the history of disease, the medical and scientific breakthroughs behind today&#39;s life-saving drugs and vaccines, and the successful campaigns that eradicated massive killer diseases like Small Pox and now are moving against the likes of AIDS, Malaria, and Polio. The course will focus, in particular, on the vision, the cooperation, the cultural understanding, and the resources needed to launch medical initiatives around the globe.

COREI-AD 39S Complexity                                             Underlying the order of natural systems and the simple rules they would appear to follow, is complexity born from the large number of objects under consideration and the functional connections between these objects at hierarchies of scale. The science of complexity, and goal of this course, concerns how to model such systems as connected networks so that we may understand better how the objects of disparate systems become self-organized, robust to disruption, and connected by links that increase in number/length according to common mathematical power laws. Topics for discussion are drawn from physical (e.g., geology, astronomy), biological (e.g., ecology, medicine), and social (e.g., economy, communications) systems. A consideration of the complexity of our own neural network, evincing conscious and unconscious benefits and hindrances to our behavior, will highlight an appreciation for the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon we call creativity, which characterizes our search for new unknowns in science.

COREI-AD 40 Idea of the Cell                                             Proteins and organic compounds came together over three billion years ago to form the first cell. However, we have only been able to see cells for approximately 300 years through the microscope. In the early days of cellular imaging, the cell body was figuratively represented as buzzing cities or mythological realms. Today, the power of electron microscopy and animation reveal more details about the inner life of cells than ever before, and yet subjective and singular interpretations of the cell have persisted. This course explores cellular identity in the context of visual imagery and advances in visualization. Students will express their own ideas of the cell by creating original short films.

These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco). The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic&#39;s scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 42S Uncertainty in Science                                             Science is fundamentally about exploring the unknown, and a major part of being a scientist is learning how to handle uncertainty. Statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, the range of validity of models, approximations, data outliers, competing interpretations: scientists spend most of their time wrestling with these problems. Unfortunately, in classrooms and in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. If uncertainty is acknowledged, it is often portrayed as an argument between two groups of experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well established facts, and scientists occasionally have clear-cut divisions of opinion, more commonly they have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about the significance of a particular measurement or study. In this class, we familiarize ourselves with the language of probability and statistics, explore how it developed historically to become central to the scientific process, and how it is used by different scientific disciplines. We discuss how scientists express their ignorance, and how individuals and policy makers can still make judgments based on incomplete scientific knowledge. We also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs. Finally, we discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, we can still put limits on our uncertainty.

COREI-AD 43 Behavior                                             Why we behave in a certain way is one of the most fascinating and complex questions and one that we often cannot even explain to ourselves. So what drives behavior? How can behavior be measured? And can behavior be changed? This course will examine behavior from the viewpoints of biology, neuroscience, economics, psychology and philosophy. We will place an emphasis on interpreting and designing experiments that measure behavior in both humans and animals. We will discuss topics as diverse as memory, morality and altruism and examine how being part of small and large groups can affect decision-making and behavior.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 44 What is Number?                                             Numbers pervade our lives, so it may seem self-evident what they are. But like languages, technologies or ideologies, numbers have a history, and understanding of them has changed over time and also been surprisingly controversial. Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers. Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality. Reading these authors will help us understand why even today&rsquo;s science has no definitive answer to the apparently simple question about its faithful servants: what is a number?

COREI-AD 45SW Progress in Science                                             Science is a social enterprise, although one traditionally thought to be grounded in facts and reason. Scientists collaborate with each other, undermine one another, and compete for funding of research. Whether a scientific idea ever sees the light of day may depend on these distinctly social factors. So how much of what we call &lsquo;scientific progress&rsquo; is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates&mdash;the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? We&#39;ll examine this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. Our starting point will be Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, we&rsquo;ll consider why many scientific revolutions occurred in Europe and not elsewhere. Are some cultural and social features more hospitable than others to scientific inquiry?

COREI-AD 46S Languages                                                        Our guiding question emerges from the story of Babel: why are there many languages? Should we view linguistic diversity on par with superficial cultural differences, as reflecting essential differences in modes of thinking, or as products of incommensurate world views? This question will be explored across disciplines, from the philosophical discussion of the (im)possibility of translation, through the literary theoretic debate about the connection between speech and writing, to recent discussions in psychology and anthropology about linguistic determinism (language determining thought or culture determining language). These debates across intellectual traditions center around the key question of the source of linguistic universals: do commonalities among languages reflect an innate brain &quot;organ&quot; or do they reflect commonalities in human culture and in general human cognitive capabilities. The linguist&rsquo;s argument for an innate universal grammar invites us to view language history in biblical terms, as the cultural fall from a single original language, fixed by biology, but such biological determinism is also consistent with the idea that the multi-lingual cosmopolitan human has always been our natural state.

COREI-AD 47S Heat and the Universe                                             This course asks what temperature reveals about the past and future of our species, planet and universe. Scientific measurements of temperature only began in the 17th century and the meaning of temperature was not fully understood until the 19th century. We will examine how that understanding developed and how temperature came to provide a key ingredient in the scientific toolbox. Its study will be used as a unifying guide to examine a wide range of phenomena in our natural world, from the cooling of the Universe in the first minutes of its expansion after the Big Bang to the role that temperature fluctuations have played in the Earth&rsquo;s history and the threats posed by global warming. Biological adaptations to different degrees of hot and cold will be examined through the action of heat and cold loving bacteria and through the techniques mammals have adopted for temperature regulation. Readings will be in the history of science and in both primary and secondary sources in physics, astronomy, biology and geology.

COREI-AD 48J Big Data from Gauss to Genomics and Facebook                                             Big Data is the science of large data sets. These sets have appeared in rising volume, variety and velocity during the last decade. The rise of big data is due chiefly to data collection via social networks, E-commerce and web navigation, but other types of data collection, related to phones, medicine or world trade are also involved. How do we get relevant information from these large data sets? For example, based on a very accurate analysis of their own collected data sets, companies as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Netflix manage to get significant hints about what should interest specific customers. Data analysis is also becoming more important in healthcare with personalized medicine. This course takes a cross-disciplinary approach to Big Data, beginning with the sources and applications of Big Data, such as business, genomics, economics, and sociology. Then, we will look at how statistics and computer science (via machine learning) aid the analysis of data sets.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 49J Science in Flux: The Galilean Revolution                                             How does science develop and change? What sorts of considerations are used to assess and evaluate scientific theories, particularly when those theories upend our entire picture of the physical world and our place in it? Are there factors that go beyond the empirical data itself, such as broader conceptual and religious considerations? And are these &lsquo;extra-empirical&rsquo; considerations legitimate constraints on scientific inquiry? This course will examine these big questions about the nature of science in the context of Galileo&rsquo;s groundbreaking theory on the nature of motion&mdash;a theory that laid the groundwork for Newton and the rise of modern science. We will look at the many conflicts in which Galileo became embroiled&mdash;scientific, religious, and personal&mdash;and study the historical developments that eventually led to widespread acceptance of the Galilean worldview. Our aim will be to understand the complicated way in which Galileo&rsquo;s physics emerged, was resisted, and eventually triumphed, and to situate that evolution within a broader narrative about the nature of scientific development and change.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Biomimetics is defined as the structure and function of biological systems as models for the design and engineering of materials.This introductory course reviews the complexities in natural materials following millions of years of evolution and how efficient they are in comparison to standard engineering materials in performing specific tasks. The course will also present students with the basic concepts of engineering materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors) and their structure/property relationship and how current manufacturing techniques inspire scientists to recreate nature-like structures to improve current engineering practice. The course is geared to the classroom and experimental laboratory setting where students manipulate materials and explore material properties for biomimetic design.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 52J Computational Tools for Cultural Comparison                                             Different cultures have both unique and common properties. These can be linguistic properties, properties of politeness, of government, of art, of economics, of food, of gender relationships, and even of war. Tools for cross-cultural comparison should allow those who are familiar with only a few cultures to enter properties and values about those cultures and then allow searchers to compare the cultures in various ways. For example, it should be possible to discover the commonalities and differences among pairs of cultures, to cluster many cultures based on their commonalities, and to find cultural rules of the form &quot;if culture has property x, then it has property y&quot;. This course will begin with the discussion of a key cultural notion-- language. You will learn the basics of linguistics and then will interact with a cross-cultural database and analysis platform called Terraling. We will also study data sets that may be useful for cross-cultural analysis mostly from the social sciences, anthropology, and archaeology. After that, you will engage in projects to use Terraling to enter other properties and values about a topic of your choice (e.g. about food, legal structure etc.). Some of that data will come from the data sets others have gathered that are on the web and some will come from data that you yourselves gather. In the process you will learn elements of statistics, machine learning, programming in Python, and experimental design and evaluation.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 53 About Mathematics                                             Mathematics takes its problems from the real world and puts order into chaos. It sometimes strongly challenges common sense and produces extraordinary dreams of human history. The course concerns questions and concepts from various areas in mathematics, in particular number theory: the ``alarm clock numbers&#39;&#39; and some of their applications (for example to music) ; irrational numbers and their intimate links with art and geometry as well as the scandal raised by their discovery in ancient Greece ; the Golden Ratio with its surprising mathematical properties, its connections with biology through Fibonacci sequences and art history; prime numbers and their chaos, order and mystery ; the fantastic number &pi;, some of its properties, and messy and beautiful formulae to approach it ; continued fractions, the sum of two-squares theorem ; the five (or three) Platonic solids from prehistory to modern times ; some amazing paradoxes raised by probabilities ; and Poincar&eacute; finite-infinite universe. Through these and other examples we will consider how and why mathematics is a subversive intellectual activity, relying on passion, imagination, and beauty as much as on logic and rigorous argumentation.

We will examine the origin of human diversity, how human diversity is measured and analyzed, and how our perception of diversity has changed through history. Emphasis will be placed on recent progress in genetics and evolution and how this progress affects our daily life and identity. Students will learn how genes can inform us about human history, ancestry and evolution. The laboratory component of the course will demonstrate how data are generated and analyzed, and will explore the difficulty encountered by scientists in inferring processes from observations and experiments. Students will have the option to collect and analyze genetic data from their own genome.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 56S Future of Medicine                                             How will medicine evolve in the future? Will doctors ever be able to prevent disease rather than react to it? And can your DNA sequence be used to develop personalized treatments? Healthcare is arguably the most important place where science meets society, and technical advances in science are raising important ethical issues about healthcare, such as genetic discrimination and designer babies. This course will look at the science, economics and politics behind medicine and healthcare systems, and use medicine as a tool to study the relative roles of the individual and government.

COREI-AD 57 Thinking                                             Thinking is what we do when we solve problems, compare alternatives, and plan for the future. But what is thinking, and how do thoughts form? People throughout history have come to very different answers to this question and have offered different metaphors for thought. The French Philosopher Descartes drew inspiration for his theories of the mind from mechanisms that were powered by pneumatics. Our modern understanding of thinking is shaped by the computer revolution. The class will discuss the underpinnings of the main fields of Psychology (e.g. Behaviorism, Freudian, Cognitive), as well as to how thinking has been viewed in a broader historical and multicultural context. We will explore how thoughts on thinking have shaped our understanding of who we are; and how our metaphors of thought have been inspired by technological developments and shaped by culture.

COREI-AD 58 Words                                             Words, words, words. Words are the basic units of language, but how do they help us communicate our thoughts? How are they internally constructed? And how do they come together to form complex meanings? How are words from different languages similar, and how are they different? Do words reflect or shape our thought? Do they expand or constrain our imagination? This interdisciplinary course explores what words are and how we think of them. The course brings together insights and ideas from a number of fields: linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, computer science, history, literature, religion and visual arts to help answer these questions. Students will read materials from a variety of books and articles and discuss them in class, and they will engage in solving and creating language puzzles. Students will learn how to analyze words in terms of their form, function and meaning in context. Term projects can range from collection and analysis of linguistic data to multidisciplinary artistic creations.

COREI-AD 60 Concepts and Categories: How We Structure the World                                             Humans have a strong tendency to group and divide objects, people, emotions, and events into different concepts and categories. These seemingly effortless acts pose fundamental questions about our understanding of the self and the nature of the world. In this course, we will read texts from history, literature, philosophy, and scientific sources, and discuss why we conceptualize the world in particular ways, whether any categories are fundamental, and the degree to which concepts and categories are innate or learned. From the conceptual taxonomies proposed as fundamental from thinkers such as Aristotle and Kant, to the findings from psychology and neuroscience that inform us about our predilections for object concepts and social groups, we will reflect on what this knowledge can tell us about the forces that shape self and society.

COREI-AD 61 Modern Drug Discovery                                             Pharmaceuticals are the most important component of modern medicine. Prescription and non-prescription drugs are the primary method used to treat a myriad of maladies: minor headaches, cold and flu symptoms, postoperative pain, bacterial infections, diabetes, cancer, AIDS, heart disease, high blood pressure, and others. Drugs approved for use in humans follow a long pathway from discovery to the market, and every drug has a fascinating human and scientific story of creativity (and in some cases serendipity), diligence, and perseverance. This course examines through case studies the history of drug discovery and the people who engage in it; the scientific breakthroughs made in the course of discovering and developing drugs; the process and ethical dimensions of how drug candidates are identified, evaluated for safety and efficacy, approved for sale, and marketed and distributed globally; the protection of intellectual property; and the consequences for human health and well-being.

COREI-AD 63 The Ethics and Politics of Public Health                                             The media presents a flood of findings and recommendations about public health based on epidemiological studies, some of it contradictory to the last published findings. Then, many of these findings and resultant policies meet with vigorous, and even volatile, opposition from citizen-groups. This course will explore the complex question of: How do historically powerful and enduring cultural influences (such as paternalism, racism, sexism, capitalism, ethnocentricity and &lsquo;causation-ism&rsquo;) contribute to volatile reactions to epidemiological findings and subsequent policy decisions designed to protect citizens in different countries today?&rsquo; Concepts from the fields of ethics, medical history, epidemiology, epistemology, and art will be central to readings, films and discussions focused addressing this core question.

COREI-AD 64 The Birth of Science                                             When was Science invented or discovered? And is this issue still relevant to our interpretation and use of the scientific method? Because of the great wealth of scientific results obtained in the Hellenistic period of ancient Greece, the course will take up such questions starting from that period. We will analyze the works of Euclid and Archimedes and others in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Geography, with a particular focus on very modern, and maybe still undiscovered, contents. The achievements of Hellenistic science and the issues it raised will be compared with some of those appearing in other golden ages of science, such as ancient Babylonia, the Islamic Golden Age, the Renaissance, and our times. The course will not consist of a review of established facts, but rather the exploration of sometimes controversial interpretations.

COREI-AD 7S Disease and Society in the Gulf: Local and Global Intersections                                             How have diseases, and efforts to control them, shaped the nature and course of Gulf societies? This course explores this core question by considering disease as a product of complex intersections between the natural and social worlds and local and global forces. Topics to be discussed include: malaria, agriculture, drainage, and war in the Tigris-Euphrates marshlands; respiratory and sexually transmitted diseases, trade, pilgrimage, and quarantine in Hormuz, Mecca, and Dubai; hunger, offerings, and therapeutics in Persian shrines, mosques, and hospitals; pesticides, food production, diabetes, and the kidney market in India and the UAE; infertility, Islam, assisted reproduction, and medical tourism in Egypt and the Gulf states; and oil, migrant labor, Gulf sovereign funds, and the WHO polio eradication campaign. Readings come from history, anthropology, sociology, and literature.

COREP-AD 01 A Thousand and One Nights                                             For centuries The 1001 Nights (or Arabian Nights) has served as a point of encounter between Middle Eastern literary traditions and the cultural politics of Western literary and artistic production and translation. This course examines the much-debated history of the Nights and the cross-cultural exchange that has seen the tales adapted for distinct audiences in medieval Egypt and Syria, modern Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.

COREP-AD 01W Culture and Difference :1001 Nights                                                                   This course focuses on questions of religious and cultural difference through the 1001 Nights and related texts. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

COREP-AD 02 Discovery and Recognition in Narrative, Film, and Drama                                             Across all cultures, stories are fashioned to withhold information at first, holding our attention through suspense. They then produce disclosures at crucial moments of denouement. For Aristotle, this dynamic movement from ignorance to knowledge is essential, especially when it takes the form of the discovery&mdash;or recognition&mdash;of previously unknown identity. Tracing an arc from the ancient world to the present day, students study how the epistemology of modern storytelling across cultures disturbs the familiar patterns of clear and comforting revelation associated with classic genres. Readings include: Aristotle&rsquo;s Poetics; Oedipus Rex; the Odyssey; the Old Testament; the Gospels of Mark and John; the Qur&rsquo;an; the Arabian Nights; Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Lear; Naguib Mahfouz; and films from the 1940s to the present.

COREP-AD 03W Journeys                                             The search for knowledge has been linked historically to the traveler&rsquo;s experience of new places and peoples. Travel necessitates the creation of translations that reveal how knowledge of otherness necessarily involves comparison to home and self. Drawing on texts that represent travel in realistic, figurative, and fantastic terms, we explore the idea that a journey entails the discovery, not only of a destination, but also of the self.

Growing scientific evidence of catastrophic&mdash;and anthropogenic&mdash; climate change brings new urgency to an old question: how do we humans conceive of our relationship to &ldquo;nature&rdquo;? This course explores how imaginative writers have situated the human in relation to Earth&rsquo;s many landscapes, plants, climates, and species. How have they depicted meaningful encounters between humans and the other animals? What have they suggested about humans&rsquo; responsibilities to the countless other living beings with whom we share this planet? How have they &ldquo;mapped&rdquo; the slippery and shifting conceptual ground that lies between the &ldquo;man-made&rdquo; and the &ldquo;natural&rdquo;? And how might a renewed engagement with this vast theme help us deal with the heavy weather ahead?

COREP-AD 10 Imagined Cities                                             This course examines the ways in which writers have responded to the social complexity of urban life and the difficult task of finding points of connection within the diversity of the city. How do writers narrate both the order and the disorder of urban space? What intellectual frameworks do they call upon to find meaning in unfamiliar settings? How do these assumptions shape what is seen and unseen within the city? And most importantly, what do these city texts reveal about the potential for building new forms of belonging and community within the urban environment? Readings will include philosophical works from ancient Greece, travel accounts of the medieval and early modern world, and fiction from writers such as Zola, Woolf, Mahfouz, Conrad and Pamuk.

What is the relationship of technology to cultural production? How do gender and sexuality define or liberate us? And, ultimately, does the artist have an obligation to address any of these issues in his/her work?

Business has its rules and contracts. How do people understand the laws that are as much a part of life as the weather? Literature&mdash;the work of the imagination&mdash;guides our great journey towards understanding. Writers dramatize the relations among law, justice, and freedom. Writers also show the effect of law on the fates, fortunes, and feelings of people. The course explores the power of literature to show us what the law is, what it should not be, and what it might be.

COREP-AD 14 Cosmopolitan Imagination                                             Originating in the idea of the world citizen and conceived in contradistinction to nationalism, cosmopolitanism can be understood as a perspective that regards human difference as an opportunity to be embraced rather than a problem to be solved. Does this perspective lie behind all &quot;great&quot; literature, which asks its readers to experience otherness by opening themselves up to another person&#39;s words and thoughts? This course uses novels, poems, plays, and films to explore the cosmopolitan impulses behind the literary imagination.

COREP-AD 15 Tragedy                                             Tragic drama originated in ancient Greece and it has been central to both the aesthetic and the philosophical traditions of the West. At the same time, many classic works of Western tragic drama have been adapted by cultures all over the world for their own ends. This course examines key works of Greek and Shakespearean tragedy, critical, historical, and philosophical reflections on these works, and versions of some of these works from non-Western cultures, especially in film.

COREP-AD 17 Technophilia and Its Discontents                                             Why must Luke Skywalker turn off his in computer at the climactic moment of George Lucas&rsquo;s iconic film Star Wars (1977)? Star Wars is celebrated in part because it started a revolution in cinematic special-effects, but underlying the film&rsquo;s narrative logic is a deeply rooted anxiety about the right uses of technology. If man, as Hannah Arendt famously put it, is homo faber , the &ldquo;creator,&rdquo; the tool-making animal, then from at least Plato to the present, human beings have been telling stories about how to use tools correctly and about how dangerous they can be. This course investigates the ways philosophical writing, novels, plays, and films have dramatized the vexed relationship between human beings and the technologies they create. What is at stake in the creation of tools and technologies? Why are human beings, perhaps now at the start of the twenty-first century more than ever, sp enamored with technological progress? Why is technophilia , the love of technology, so often accompanied by its opposite, technophobia , the fear of technology? What do the attitudes represented in the texts and films we are reading tell us about the dynamics of human agency and about the relationship between science and religion? Texts and films come from a variety of world cultures and include Alif the Unseen , Arabian Nights , Blade Runner , Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? , The Caves of Steel, Metropolis , Paradise Lost , Phaedrus , R.U.R. (Rossum&rsquo;s Universal Robots) , and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

COREP-AD 19W Myth, Magic, and Representations of Childhood                                             This course is fueled by two related questions: how have cultural ideas of &ldquo;childhood&rdquo; changed over time, and how have ancient tales of myth and magic found expression in cultures around the world? Almost every culture in the world has some tradition that includes mythical or magical tales; very often these tales include the exploits of a youthful protagonist. What can these tales, and their evolution&mdash;and transmission&mdash;over time and place, reveal to us about our own cultural preoccupations, as well as the cultures where these tales were originally produced? Through an examination of materials including graphic novels, fairy tales, movies, and fiction, we will consider the ways in which representations of childhood reveal ideas about power, politics, and the relationship between the self and society. Readings may include excerpts from The Arabian Nights ; Grimm&rsquo;s fairy tales; various Harry Potter novels; films from Hiyao Miyazaki, Disney, and Pixar, among others.

COREP-AD 20 Speculative Fiction                                             This course uses texts and films to explore the speculative impulse behind narrative. Through the analysis of science fiction, utopian and dystopian narratives, texts from political theory, and even works considered to be &ldquo;realist&rdquo; in their orientation, students consider the ways in which works of fiction present their readers with thought experiments that pose different kinds of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; questions. Is it possible to conceive of speculative fiction as, in fact, the type of all fiction?    *Note: This course is no longer being offered.

The course studies the representation of families&mdash;both biological and symbolic&mdash;as a source of blessings and burdens, bonding and betrayal in literary texts from around the world, starting with the Odyssey and moving on through the Middle Ages to modern writing. The course also investigates modern theories of the family as found in the works of such thinkers as Engels, Freud, and Foucault.

COREP-AD 22 Changing Notions of Race in Literature                                             This course examines a wide variety of literary texts on black-white couples, interracial families, and biracial identity, from classical antiquity to the present. Works studied include romances, novellas, plays, novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction, as well as some films and examples from the visual arts. Topics for discussion range from interracial genealogies to racial &ldquo;passing,&rdquo; from representations of racial difference to alternative plot resolutions, and from religious and political to legal and scientific contexts for the changing understanding of &ldquo;race.&rdquo;                                                                      Spring 1 2012 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                   Werner Sollors                                           -             UW, 9:55-12:35                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 1 2014 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                   Werner Sollors                                           -             TR, 10:00-12:30 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREP-AD 23 Doubles and Masks                                             Among the more significant activities of human beings is that of giving shape to fears and desires through art. All cultures participate in this form of emotional exteriorization, including creating &ldquo;doubles&rdquo; and &ldquo;masks&rdquo; through myths, literature, and other media. Concentrating on doubles and masks in several different cultures, we will chart the meaning and impact of the archetypal masked figures of the commedia dell&rsquo;arte in French and British theatre; the obsessive concern with the grotesque (the monstrous mask) in French romanticism and in Haitian magical realism; zombification, carnival figures, and ghostly doubles in Latin American, North American, and African cultural forms. We build a repertory of approaches to interpreting and uncovering the many layers of masking and doubling by reading in anthropology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and literary theory.

COREP-AD 24W Contagion                                             How do we respond to news that some among us are ill, and that the illness is, perhaps, contagious? Are the healthy ethically obliged to tend to the sick? What are the relationships between contagious disease and verbal communication: rumors, medical information, stories about the dying and the dead? How has illness literally and metaphorically participated in the reimagination of community, kinship, and sexuality in different times and places? This course examines the intersections of contagious disorder and storytelling in a range of cultures, settings, and forms, from ancient Greece to contemporary South Africa, from the Black Death, influenza, and AIDS to the proliferation of zombies and vampires in global popular culture today.

How do we fashion meaning in history and interpret other civilizations? This course looks for answers to these questions in the first great histories of the known world, Herodotus&rsquo;s Histories and Sima Qian&rsquo;s Records of the Historian . Addressing world history from the vantage point of ancient Greece and Ancient China, these works gave narrative an unprecedented geographical scope and acquired a textual authority previously enjoyed only by epics and chronicles. They also yielded model accounts of cultural difference that have influenced other narrative forms in fiction and non-fiction, textual and visual culture - to this day. In addition to Herodotus and Sima Qian, readings include selections from Homer and early Chinese chronicles, as well as contemporary historical fiction (such as Gore Vidal&rsquo;s Creation ), the films Hero and The Emperor and the Assassin , and journalist Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski&#39;s memoir and travelogue Travels with Herodotus .

COREP-AD 26 Oceans                                             Oceans spell motion. They have transformed human destiny since the beginning of time. They are rolling spaces of experimentation and exchange, hope and heartbreak, where peoples&rsquo; engagement with each other has unfolded, where humans have tussled with nature and interpreted the divine. Human interactions with oceans have spurred trade, set the boundaries of nations, built empires, redistributed populations, redefined tastes in food, produced new forms of art and music, transmitted diseases, and triggered new ideas and innovations in politics, law, science and technology. Above all, oceans continue to carry &ndash; and all too often thwart &ndash; the dreams of becoming and belonging of humans on the move. This course will explore the ways in which literary works across many genres &ndash; novels, plays, and poetry &ndash; have portrayed human relationships with oceans. It will prompt you to ask: how has the ocean functioned as a metaphor for the individual&rsquo;s connection with nature and society? In what ways do depictions of oceans commemorate or comment upon a panoply of human experiences through time? What affect and emotions do they encode? What identities do they create?

COREP-AD 28 Enchantment                                             The advent of the novel marked a break with a magical way of thinking. &ldquo;A magic curtain, woven of legends, hung before the world,&rdquo; writes Milan Kundera, &ldquo;Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore the curtain.&rdquo; Is enchantment possible after modernity? And if so, what form might it take? A reenchantment as foreseen by religious cosmography, in which the human realm intersectswith that of jinn or other supernatural beings? Or might the discoveries and technologies of the modern world, including the laws of physics and breakthroughs in science, themselves be conceived as enchanting? This course looks at attempts from various cultural vantage points to reconcile magicand realism in the aftermath of secularism and modernity. Must enchantment survive only as an escape from reason? Or might it be compatiblewith the Enlightenment and scientific inquiry? We will look at responses to the riddle of magic in modern society in the art, theatre, film and fiction of Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.    *Note: this course is unlikely to be available to students who have already completed LITCW-AD 120 Magic Realism                                                                       Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Paulo Lemos Horta                                           -             TR, 9:55-11:10 AM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Paulo Lemos Horta                                           -             MW, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREP-AD 30 Mortal and Immortal Questions                                             We will read a wide-ranging selection of works from different cultures and chronological periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about what it means to be a human being faced with death. We will examine the attitudes and actions of characters struggling to understand the meaning of death and who must decide whether they believe that death is an evil that harms them or is something they should just ignore. We will also consider the ways in which their views about immortality affect their actions and whether a desire for immortality has beneficial or detrimental affects on their lives and the lives of people around them. More generally, we will be looking at some of the ways that different authors and cultures treat the question of how significant one&rsquo;s death is to the continuing existence of others and what it means in different times and places to say that someone has died. Readings will include Euripides, Plato, Lucretius, Kyokai, Boccaccio, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Marquez, Morrison, Barnes, Salih, Hariharan, and Kanafani.

COREP-AD 31 Nation and Narration                                             The nation is as much cultural concept as political ideology. The formulation &lsquo;nation and narration&rsquo; envisages both the construction of the nation as narration and the imaginings of the nation in narrative (historical and literary). To capture a sense of the wide-ranging connections between nation and narration we track, through a variety of texts across cultures, periods and genres, the spread of the idea of the modern nation from Europe to the rest of the world; the struggles of anti-colonial nationalisms; the birth of postcolonial nation-states; their subsequent trials and tribulations; the rhetoric of nationalism; the critiques of nationalism; the voices of minorities, immigrants and indigenous peoples that disrupt a homogeneous &lsquo;national culture&rsquo;; the phenomena of transnationalism and globalization; and their implications for the future of the nation-state. Readings and films to be studied include: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Half of a Yellow Sun ; Assia Djebar, Fantasia, an Algerian Cavalcade ; Dave Eggers, What is the What ; D.W. Griffith, Birth of the Nation ; Michael Ondaatje, English Patient ; Salman Rushdie, Midnight&rsquo;s Children ; William Shakespeare, King Henry ; and Rabindranath Tagore, Home and the World .

COREP-AD 32 Stigma                                             Societies develop cultural behaviors that indicate the relative value of its members. Social acceptance has been historically dependent on its mutually constitutive term&mdash;ostracism&mdash;as members act on how they perceive and maintain their status in relationship to others. In this class, we will read novels, memoirs and plays that examine and deconstruct how systems of social worth operate, and how the nuances of those systems create and enforce devalued categories of people. Readings focus on works that consider the specific attributes that adhere to the historically stigmatized categories of illness and disability. We will discover how stigma affects feelings of self-worth and mediates engagement with others. Sociologist Erving Goffman observed that stigma creates &ldquo;spoiled identities.&rdquo; Using ideas offered in Goffman&rsquo;s seminal text on stigma, anthropologist Mary Douglas&rsquo;s work on pollution and taboo, our readings will focus on authors who deconstruct experiences of stigma, and who write in order to destabilize, revise, and repair the personal and social damage stigmatizing categories and behaviors inflict.

COREP-AD 33 Quest for Knowledge                                             Humanity&rsquo;s need to make sense of itself and its place in the universe has generated the world&rsquo;s oldest creation stories and its most enduring myths. The quest for knowledge has itself also been a perennial theme of world literature. This course examines the impulse to construct knowledge in a variety of time periods and cultural traditions, raising questions about how human communities around the world have conceived of the nature, conditions, limits, and means of acquiring knowledge. Readings include ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian myths, The Epic of Gilgamesh (Mesopotamia) , The Bhagavad Gita (India) , Plato&rsquo;s &ldquo;Allegory of the Cave&rdquo; (Greece), Farid ud-Din Attar&rsquo;s The Conference of the Birds (Persia) , Murasaki Shikibu&rsquo;s The Tale of Genji (Japan), Cao Xueqin&rsquo;s Dream of the Red Chamber (China), Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dora&rdquo; (Austria), Alberto Mussa&rsquo;s The Riddle of Qaf (Brazil), and short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle (Britain), Jorge Luis Borges (Argentina), and Naguib Mahfouz (Egypt).

COREP-AD 34 Autobiography: Ideas of the Self in a Global World                                             Storytelling is a way for humans to understand the world and their position in it. This is particularly true for those who write to tell their own life stories. In this course, we will explore how these self-narratives allow their authors to comprehend their position in a globally connected world. We will read autobiographies by public figures and private citizens from different traditions and time periods who travel away from home and then write about their experience. Readings include Augustine&rsquo;s Confessions (4th century), Al-Ghazali&rsquo;s Deliverance from Error (11th century), Margery Kempe&rsquo;s memoirs (15th century), Catalina de Erauso&rsquo;s Memoirs of a Basque Lieutenant Nun (17th century), Jean-Jacques Rousseau&rsquo;s Confessions (18th century), Olaudah Equiano&rsquo;s Interesting Narrative (18th century), N.O.

COREP-AD 35 Exile, Diaspora, and Migration                                             Diaspora has also been a recurring feature of human history since the dispersal of Jews from the Middle East, of Africans during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, or of the Irish during the Great Hunger. In the past two centuries, millions have migrated from their homelands to work or find refuge in far-away countries with cultures very different from their own. How do human beings come to terms with such conditions and transformations in their lives? What are the cultural, emotional, and intellectual effects of being exiled from your place of birth? How far can loss be compensated for by the idea that something can also be gained? In this course we consider connections and differences between experiences of exile, diaspora, and migration by examining stories and writing about them in the Bible, the Odyssey , and texts by Plutarch, Ovid, Dante, Byron, Dostoevsky, Conrad, C&eacute;saire, Naipaul, Rhys, Lamming, Carpentier, Darwish, Edward Said, Julia Alvarez and Kiran Desai.

Seemingly heedless of cultural norms, these characters in their many different guises point to the important role of play and disruption in the making of culture. In this course, students will consider rogues, outlaws, and outsiders of various types from around the world and their portrayal in stories, novels, dramas, songs, and films. Building a repertoire of trickster characters, types, and tropes, students examine how these characters&rsquo; dynamic roles relate to central problems of art, creativity, and life.

COREP-AD 38 Money and the Good Life                                             This course examines a variety of cultural conceptions of money and wealth, and the ethical questions that money or wealth allows a writer to probe. Is the value of men measured by the value of their money, or are there other criteria for wealth? Is someone&rsquo;s wealth possible without someone else&rsquo;s poverty? How is human ambition rewarded or punished in the &ldquo;pecuniary culture&rdquo;? The course looks for answers to these and other questions in key works of literature, sociology, economics and other fields, reading classical texts ranging from Aristophanes' Plutus, Ihara Saikaku's \"A dose of what the doctor never orders,\" and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, to Honor&eacute; de Balzac's P&egrave;re Goriot, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. Readings will be supplemented by excerpts from works by Ibn Khaldun, Adam Smith, Thorstein Veblen, Max Weber, and Alfred Hirshman.

COREP-AD 39 Bodies in Pain: Literary Representations of Disease and Health                                             As the Arabic saying goes, &ldquo;Health is a crown worn by the healthy and seen only by the ill.&rdquo; Throughout history, literature has staged the human struggle with disease and the related search for a cure. This course depicts the literary representation of pathologies and their medical treatments, ranging from eighteenth-century European treatises on the &ldquo;English Malady&rdquo; to the depiction of tuberculosis and leprosy in twentieth-century Japan. In the attempt to restore health, the relationship between patient and doctor is of central importance and therefore constitutes a thematic focus for this course. Readings will include: George Cheyne&rsquo;s The English Malady, Franz Kafka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Country Doctor,&rdquo; Thomas Mann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Death in Venice,&rdquo; Yahya Hakki&rsquo;s Lamp of Umm Hashim, Bernard Pomerance&rsquo;s The Elephant Man, Albert Camus&rsquo; The Plague, Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s Dora, Charlotte Perkins Gilman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yellow Wallpaper,&rdquo; Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indian Camp,&rdquo; Gail Tsukiyama&rsquo;s The Samurai&rsquo;s Garden, and Sanjay Gupta&rsquo;s Monday Mornings.

COREP-AD 41 The Soul                                             The theme of this class will be the discovery and exploration of the concept of the soul in the religious and philosophic traditions of the Mediterranean. We will focus on the great questions about the soul--the conscious self and its identity-- persisting up to and perhaps beyond death: What is it to be a person in a body? Is there something that is our essential self, independent of the body? Is this something conscious? Does it include the mind? Does it survive death? How exactly? Will it be judged, as Plato and Socrates thought and many religions suggest? We will explore these ideas from the Greeks through the Christians and Muslims, reading Homer, Plato, Augustine and Ibn Sina. The class will conclude with a glimpse at the late Renaissance, when the permanence and even presence of human souls became more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in the ancient and medieval worlds. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way, whether to faith--or away from it.

COREP-AD 42 Animals                                             Mankind&rsquo;s relationship to animals has always been ambivalent. Animals have been deified and demonised, petted and abused, cherished and exploited. While modern science is increasingly blurring the supposed demarcation line between animals (equalling nature) and humans (equalling reason), literature has allowed for transgressions that have worked both ways: transformations go from human to animal and vice versa. Not only this; throughout history animals have been thought to possess human qualities (and also: vice versa) such as speech and reason and have been represented to act in a way that often seems more human than the way humans behave. The class starts with the earliest literary document of mankind, The Epic of Gilgamesh, looks at texts from Antiquity and the Middle Ages from various civilisations (Aesopus, The Jataka Tales, The Panchatantra, Apuleius, Lucian, The Physiologus, The Journey to the West) and up to modern times (Darwin, Carroll, Kipling, Kafka, Dick) and also one film which especially reflects upon the strained relationship to an animal and man&rsquo;s self-perception in the face of nature (Moby Dick).

COREP-AD 43W Knowledge and Doubt                                             We will explore the relation of knowledge and doubt in a wide variety of texts in different genres, historical periods, and cultural contexts. Some our questions will be about sources of knowledge and evidence, while others will be about the nature of our capacities for knowing things. Questions include: what sources of knowledge can we trust, if any? Are there ways to achieve knowledge by transcending our normal sensory and rational capacities? Might we be systematically deceived about the world and, if so, could we still find happiness in such a condition? Is our knowledge inevitably dependent on others or are our best sources of knowledge found within? How can our knowledge be distorted by strong emotions such as hatred or love? Readings will be from Mo-Tzu, Sophocles, Nagarjuna, Ibn Tufayl, Dante, Montaigne, Cervantes, Descartes, Hume, Rousseau, and Proust.

COREP-AD 44 Laughter                                             Laughter is an essential part of the human experience. Why do we laugh, and what does it mean? How does laughter function within us as individuals, in our local circles, and as a global community? What evokes laughter that transcends culture, and what is culturally specific? In this course students will confront laughter and its capacity to disarm, connect, heal, teach, debunk, humiliate, reform, confront, expose, progress, politicize, humanize, and empower.

COREP-AD 45 Narrative and (Un)knowing                                             The fundamental question we will probe in this course is how narratives represent our coming to know. Ever since the Enlightenment, the West typically assumes knowing to be the achievement of a rational subject moving progressively through lawful space and time&mdash;and figuring things out. Only a lawful world allows the questing subject to arrive at knowledge and self-knowledge. This progressive story serves as a central target of modernist and postcolonial critique. Writers such as Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kafka, Freud, Faulkner, and Beckett call into question the narrative of the knowing Western subject. Garcia-Marquez&rsquo;s postcolonial One Hundred Years of Solitude simply dispenses with Western priorities of knowing and self-knowledge.

COREP-AD 46W Extinction                                             Scientists believe that our planet is experiencing its sixth mass extinction (the fifth, caused by a meteor collision, occurred 65 million years ago). Many even have called for the recognition of a new epoch, the Anthropocene, to mark the massive impact of human activities and human-induced extinctions on its biosphere. But how do we make sense of this era&rsquo;s accelerating rate of species death? What is the relationship between the extinction of a species and the extinction of cultures, languages, and lifeways? How have biodiversity loss, language death, the vanishing of &ldquo;savage races&rdquo; and aboriginal populations, genocide, and the specter of self-extinction shaped our understanding of what it means to be human? This course examines the human encounter with biotic, cultural, and metaphorical extinctions in a variety of genres, from Darwin&rsquo;s reflections aboard the Beagle to the preservation of Ishi (&ldquo;the last wild Indian),&rdquo; and from flood narratives to apocalyptic fantasies.

COREP-AD 47 Dreams                                             Dreaming is a trait that human beings share with a lot of other mammals. It was, however, not until Freud&rsquo;s insights into the subjective nature of dreams and especially neuroscience&rsquo;s explorations of the material basis of dreams and their cognitive function, that dreams were considered to belong in the realm of metaphysics. Thus, they served supernatural powers as a vehicle for prophecy and premonition. Literature has made use of these specific qualities in order to reflect on the dreaming persons&rsquo; ethical motivations, impulses to act, finding their identity, being deluded or informed and changing their ways. The class spans texts and one film (Kubrick) that represent dreams, either literally or metaphorically, from Antiquity (Cicero) to the present day (Borges) and across a variety of civilisations.

COREP-AD 48 Humans Deformed and Transformed                                             All cultures attempt to define what it is to be human. In the process, all cultures ponder individuals who do not fit definitions of the human&mdash;individuals who fall short or soar above their peers by commingling human with nonhuman ways and forms of being. Werewolves, wild men, fox women, and bird people test human nature against other natures. Sometimes these creatures find human nature lacking, and supplement the lack by reaching out into other natures; other times their transformations stage confrontations between civilization and chaos. We will survey how poets and narrative artists have imagined the commingling of humanity and non-humanity across several centuries and cultures. What are the attractions of getting beyond, or sinking below, the limits of the human? How do cultures set those limits? What resources does literature offer for thinking about self-definition in relation to social responsibility?

COREP-AD 49 Migration                                             There are more migrants worldwide today than Brazil has inhabitants. China, India, and the Philippines are sending most migrants; the most important host areas are Europe and the United States; and expats make up more than 60% of the total population in Qatar and the UAE. How has migration been represented in and shaped by literature and art? This course reviews exemplary texts, striking images, and important films. Focus is on the United States from around 1880 to World War II and on Europe in the second half of the twentieth century, then opening up toward students&rsquo; examination of cultural work by and about contemporary migrants from around the world. Readings include autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and creative visual work. Among the topics for discussion are metaphors and theories of migration (from uprooting and bird-of-passage to expatriate and melting-pot); labor arrangements; scenes of departure, voyage, and arrival; vibrant migrant communities and migrant alienation and pain; negotiation between places of origin and of arrival.

COREP-AD 50 Slavery and Freedom                                             This course draws upon literature, folk tales, films, and paintings to connect and compare the ways in which slavery has been imagined, experienced, narrated, and contested in different parts of the world from antiquity to the present. We will start by charting cross-cultural debates over &ldquo;slave&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; through the ages, before proceeding to explore texts and images that positioned the &ldquo;slave&rdquo; as subject, and used literacy as a mode of resistance. How did these narratives define &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and shape international abolitionist publics? How might we read them for evidence of slave culture and community, and imaginaries of race, gender, and nation? How do novels and films serve as sites of public memory --or amnesia -- about slavery? What do they tell us about the threshold between history and literature? How does historical context serve to explain fiction? How do novelists and artists both use and challenge the archives to imagine &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in ways that official history writing does not accommodate? Course materials may be drawn from the works of Aristotle, Manu, Kautilya, Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas, George Fitzhugh, Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Toni Morrison, Caryl Phillips, Amitav Ghosh, Rayda Jacob, and Abdurazak Gurnah, as well as the Uncle Remus Tales, and paintings and excerpts from the films Gone with the Wind, Amistad, Beloved, Twelve Years a Slave, Ceddo, Razia Sultan, Rue Cases N&egrave;gres, and Quilombo.

COREP-AD 51 Utopias &amp; Dystopias                                             We all think about wanting to live in the perfect world, but what happens when definitions of &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; conflict with one another? In this Pathways of World Literature course, we will explore the ways that writers and artists have wrestled with the question of &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; and, more particularly, the ways in which utopias always seem to fall short of their ideal. As we examine these failed utopias, we will consider the ways in which these texts explore the increasingly fraught relationship between humanity and technology, and between the community and the individual. Drawing on written and cinematic texts from around the world, this course will consider whether any attempt at utopia is doomed, given the human proclivity for violence and xenophobia. We will also consider why, in recent years, dystopian worlds have become the mainstay of pop culture, from novels to video games and movies. The course may include contemporary work by Hiyao Miyazaki, Chan Koonchung, and Vladimir Sorokin, as well as such classics as Thomas More&rsquo;s Utopia , Charlotte Perkins Gilman&rsquo;s Herland , and Fritz Lang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metropolis.&rdquo;                                                                       Summer 2015                                                                                          Deborah Williams                                           -             UMTWR, 10:00 -12:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREP-AD 52 Reading the Earth                                              This course introduces students to a wide variety of perspectives on the way that nature and its relation to human agency has been conceived from the industrial revolution onwards. As we face dramatic climate changes and the specter of wholesale annihilation, understanding our conceptions of and relation to nature becomes more pressing. Can we repair the rifts between humans and nature caused by industrialization? How have technological innovations affected attitudes toward the environment? The course will be constructed around a series of discrete problems, including today&rsquo;s most pressing eco-critical dilemmas, that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. Readings will include works by Gaskell, Williams, Zola, Stifter, De Tocqueville, Marx, Tekin, Munif, Tolstoy, Sepulveda, Carson and others.

COREP-AD 53 Disability                                             This course considers disability as a cultural concept that describes how human variation matters in the world. How has disability have been understood over time and across cultures? How have disabled bodies been represented and classified? How does disability intersect with other identity formations such as race, class, and gender? Ultimately, we will ask: what new forms of representation might bodily difference produce? Alongside texts that may describe disability as defective or tragic, we will trace other literary possibilities for bodies and minds that resist normative structures, from narratives that theorize ideas of access, cure, and care to fictions that reclaim disability as enlivening identity. Readings for the course range across drama, poetry, novels, essays, and films, including Sophocles, Philoctetes; J.M. Coetzee, Waiting for the Barbarians; Kazuo Ishiguro, Never Let Me Go; William Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Lear; David B., Epileptic; Kaite O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Peeling; Doris Baizley and Victoria Ann Lewis, P.H.*reaks; Octavia Butler, &ldquo;Speech Sounds&rdquo; and more.

COREP-AD 54 Pilgrimage and Enlightenment                                             For much of human history, the West meant India, the source of Buddhism, and a destination for pilgrims in search of enlightenment. This course examines the relationship between pilgrimage and enlightenment. Is pilgrimage a metaphor of a life well lived, or must it be a literal journey in search of a higher state of being? Is the purpose of pilgrimage to reach a destination, or is the journey itself, wherever it leads, more important? When is pilgrimage an individual affair, and when are more communal aspects essential to the journey. We begin our journey in India with Ashvagosha&#39;s Life of the Buddha, and then follow a trail of religious cultural production &ndash; including sutras, mandalas, and records of individual pilgrims &ndash; that culminates in the Chinese literary masterpiece, Journey to the West. The course then turns to &quot;Non Eastern&quot; adaptations of Journey, including Maxine Hong Kingston&#39;s Tripmaster Monkey and such films as The Lost Empire, before closing with comparisons of Buddhist pilgrimage with the Hajj, as well as &ldquo;modern Western&rdquo; journeys to Asia in search of spiritual alternatives to material civilization.

COREP-AD 58 (Dis)placements                                             One of the most significant developments in cultural and literary studies in recent times has been the focus on migration and displacement. The study of globalization further emphasizes detachment from the material world and privileges movement over locale. Consequently this emphasis on migration tends to position mobility and rootedness as opposite poles, often celebrating the former and neglecting or even devaluing the latter. The question is how a sense of place can persist in the face of all this movement and interaction. This course will consist of theoretical and fictional texts which make a case for revisiting the question of a global sense of place. How does the experience of displacement or contact with the outside change our relation to place? Is there a reaction to place that transcends nostalgia for lost origins? If displacement is valued over placement do the experiences of men predominate? The theoretical and fictional readings will center on the shaping force of place in human experience and the primacy of setting and landscape in narratives.

COREP-AD 61 Cultural Memory and Resistance                                             As the Atlantic slave trade forcibly dispersed Africans throughout Europe and the Americas over four centuries, cultural memory became a key component of survival for those who journeyed through the Middle Passage. How did languages incorporate modes of expression &ndash;creole, patois, pidgin&mdash;that connected with scarce-remembered cosmologies and ways of being to allow for resistance to systems of oppression? And how was the traditional music of African peoples reconstructed with new instruments and inflections during this process? We will examine texts ranging from Plato, the Book of Exodus, Ibn Battuta, The Tale of Sundiata , early African slave narratives, the music of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, works by Amiri Baraka, Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire, Edouard Glissant, Wole Soyinka, Mos Def, Common, Nubian Sisters, Saul Williams, Talib Kweli, Tupac Shakur, and in films such as Sugar Cane Alley , La Haine , Illmatic and Belle to better understand key components of cultural memory and resistance.

CORES-AD 01W Tolerance and Relativism                                             Most of us agree that we should be tolerant. Often the call for tolerance is grounded in relativism&mdash;the thought that there isn&rsquo;t a fact of the matter. After all, on what basis could we insist that others share our beliefs if those beliefs are subjective, a function of upbringing or our peculiar tastes and concerns? But should we accept relativism? Can relativism justify tolerance? If not, then how can we justify tolerance?                        This course is writing intensive .

CORES-AD 02 Wealth of Nations                                             This course examines the determinants of economic development in the modern world. The course is divided into two parts. The first reviews theories that place factors of production such as labor and technology as the main cause of cross-country differences in economic wealth. The second part of the course investigates the role of institutions, culture, religion, geography, and luck as deeper causes of comparative development. The main questions addressed throughout the course are: Why are there such large differences in income per capita across countries? Why have some countries developed steadily over the past 200 years while many others have not? Why do some governments adopt policies that promote economic development while others set up barriers to economic activity? These questions are analyzed from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

CORES-AD 05a Relationship of Government and Religion                                                        This course examines the relationship between government and religion. To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: \"Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.   This course extends over two semesters and both CORES-AD 05a and CORES-AD 05b must be completed to secure credit for the course.

To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: \"Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.   Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the political theory field.

We examine how animals are socially or culturally constructed in &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;modern&rdquo; societies, and consider proposals for studying animals as minded social actors.

CORES-AD 10 What is Man?                                             The human sciences, born of the Enlightenment&rsquo;s quest to recreate Man in its image, gave rise to a paradox. In brokering reconfigurations of the essence and boundaries of the human, new models for socio-political organization, and claims to inalienable human rights, they also demarcated and fortified the supposedly &lsquo;natural&rsquo; fault lines between sexes, races, cultures, and peoples. The course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the nature of cultural distinction and the historical development of the Image of Man in a variety of global case studies, from the eighteenth century to the present.

In this course we trace the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day, drawing on primary sources and secondary readings from religious studies, the history of science, and anthropology.

CORES-AD 12 Love, God, and Politics                                             The course grapples with love, a blind spot in social theory, and its relation with religion, transcendence, sacrifice, and faith. On the one hand, sexuality and gender have become objects of intense concern, politicized by religious movements around the world from the fundamentalist Christians in America to Islamists and pietists in the Islamic world. On the other hand, for large numbers of young people in the Western world not only has sexuality become increasingly unhinged from love, but love has become a troubling category, something uncertain and dangerous to believe in. This course examines the relation between love, sex, and religion as they reverberate in both the private and public spheres.

CORES-AD 13 Family, Gender, and Modernity                                             This class examines a few universal, global patterns in the history of families and the many ways that families are culturally diverse. We begin with a historical survey, from the \"traditional\" families that once dominated throughout the world, to the \"modern\" (industrial) and \"post-modern\" (post-industrial) family values that appear today. Then we focus on particular aspects of family life: childhood; dating and courtship; sex and reproduction; husband-wife relations; old age; female-headed and other non-traditional families.

CORES-AD 14 Self-Representation                                             There are many different ways in which human beings represent themselves. I represent myself as a living being, as belonging to a given society and culture, as having a given character, and so on. But do I have a representation of myself as the author of those representations? Exploring this question casts light on central questions of philosophy, for instance the relation between mind and body, the relation between self and other, or the belief that we have freedom of the will. Readings may include selections from Western philosophy and Buddhist philosophy as well as neuroscience, psychology, psychoanalysis, and literary works.

They are spaces for deliberation and collective action. This class explores the reasons why most humans now live in cities, why cities rise and decline, and how they become sites and stakes of political protest. We start by examining the politics of urban development in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and by analyzing three urban protests, in early 1990s Riyadh, in Cairo during the Egyptian revolution, and in New York City during the Occupy Wall Street movement. We then explore the concomitant processes of city making and politicization as analyzed by Plato, Ibn Khaldun, Hegel, Engels, Marx, Weber, Freud, and Simmel. The last part of the course is dedicated to interdisciplinary urban studies, from urban anthropology to the history of urban planning and to subaltern urbanism. In-class sessions are complemented by field visits to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.                       This course is writing intensive .

Yet what we mean by family or by kinship changes dramatically across societies and through time. This course introduces social scientific approaches to and methods for understanding and analyzing this diversity; it therefore asks students to explore the relationship between the universal and what is specific to particular societies and cultures.

CORES-AD 21 Gender and Globalization                                             What does gender as category of analysis indicate? How does gender intersect with other axes of identity such as class, nation, and ethnicity in a globalized world? The course introduces students to select women&rsquo;s issues (e.g. employment, political participation, reproductive rights and healthcare, feminism vs. multiculturalism, gender based violence, and peace building) that have emerged in the global context and the international debates that surround them. In addition, the course looks at the relevance of women&rsquo;s representation to address barriers to gender equality in the &lsquo;democratic process&rsquo; as well as the shortcomings of democratic mechanisms to achieve women&rsquo;s rights and some proposed solutions to these limitations.

Moreover, &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; are often held to be at odds with one another; if modernity can be defined by its claim to universal applicability, then culture(s) mark the disjunctures and discrepancies that repeatedly disrupt this narrative. This course examines the (cross-) cultural politics and imaginaries of &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; to ask: What does it mean to be modern in the global present?

CORES-AD 23 Financial Systems as Social Forms                                             Financial systems direct flows of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. This course compares the theories implicit in the U.S. and UAE financial systems and describes how they work in practice. Whereas credit and interest are central to U.S. banking, Shari&rsquo;ah law forbids interest, so Islamic banking uses profit- and loss-sharing to organize investment. By comparing these two systems, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in a global context.

CORES-AD 24W Landscapes of Memory                                             This course explores the ways in which urban landscapes have traditionally served as fragile repositories for collective memory from the first monuments of Near Eastern civilizations to the modern architecture of contemporary global cities. Some cities seek to preserve their pasts, while others aggressively brush aside older forms and structures to make way for the new. Students examine the &ldquo;politics&rdquo; of urban memory, exploring historical and contemporary debates about the conflicting demands of preservation and modernization in a variety of cities from around the world.

CORES-AD 25 Gift and Exchange                                                        Gift giving occurs in all cultures. A gift can be a material object or money, but it can also be an act of kindness or love. A gift is free but it can also come with the expectation that it will be matched by a return gift. Gift giving is therefore part of a complex structure of economic and social exchange. This course considers gift giving from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and the arts; it explores gift exchange through ethnographies as well as texts on market economies and art, gender, death, altruism, risk, and the impacts of colonialism on traditional exchange societies. Readings will include seminal works on gift exchange by Marcel Mauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, Franz Boas, and others.

CORES-AD 26 Legitimacy                                             What are the foundations of political legitimacy and to what extent do governments abide by them? In this course, we will explore these questions using both classical and contemporary accounts. The first half of the course focuses on political systems in Ancient Greece, Rome, Medieval Europe, and Early Modern Europe through the lens of great thinkers, including Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Burke, Weber, and Marx, as well as a series of primary source documents. We then proceed to the &ldquo;post-1789&rdquo; world and discuss legitimacy in the context of democratic government. Topics covered include the role of legislators, issue representation, descriptive vs. substantive governance, and the ongoing debate between advocates of majoritarianism and those of proportionalism.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

CORES-AD 29W Property                                             The institution of property describes one of the fundamental relationships between people: the relationship between people as it pertains to things. In this seminar, we explore how understandings of property have been influenced by cultural and ethical norms in different civilizations; how property rights have evolved with technological progress and changes in the demands of the environment; how property is affected by and influences the sphere of individual freedom, the relation between the individual and the state, and the organization of productive activity. As examples, we will look at property in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome; consider the views on property expressed in Christianity and Islam as well as the role that changing views on property played in the Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution. We will use our insights to debate contemporary issues in property rights of interest to seminar participants. These might include intellectual property rights, rights to genetic material, inheritance, airwaves, financial regulation, the rights of indigenous tribes of the Amazon rainforest, claims on the Arctic, or the trade-off between rights to privacy and freedom of the press.

CORES-AD 34J Polarization                                             Polarization has been a feature of societies around the world since the inception of human civilization. To this day, individuals routinely sort themselves in to groups based on share political, social, religious, or cultural beliefs. In turn, these sorted groups often find themselves at polar extremes from one another, something that has often led to intense, and sometimes violent, conflict. In this course, we will explore the history, emergence, and pervasiveness of various kinds of polarization: ethnic, linguistic, religious, political, and geographic. We will begin the course by defining polarization and looking at examples of it from antiquity to the present. Thereafter, we will look at the consequences of polarization for politics, social interactions, and economics. The course will be taught using classical works by kings and statesmen (e.g., Constantine of Rome, Louis XIV of France, Woodrow Wilson), as well as contemporary scholarship from a diverse group of scholars: historians, demographers, political scientists, biologists, and economists. Special attention will be given to social media and social networking, a pervasive aspect of contemporary social polarization; it will serve as the basis for a course-long project. Prerequisites: None; some familiarity with social networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn) and Microsoft Excel would be useful, but not required.   * Please note the duration of this course during summer 2013 is 26 May-12 June.

CORES-AD 35 Hard Choices                                             Life is rife with hard choices. Should you become a doctor or a lawyer? How much should you sacrifice in order to help others? Should you marry and have children? This course examines the phenomenon of hard choices by focusing on two questions: (1) what makes a choice hard? and (2) what should/does one do when faced with a hard choice? We explore answers to these questions from a variety of perspectives &ndash; philosophical, religious, literary, psychological, and neuroscientific.

CORES-AD 36 Ideas of the Sacred                                             The question of God(s) pertains to the existence, manifestations, meaning, and attributes of the sacred. Although conceptions about the sacred are inevitably shaped by history and culture, the fundamental question of God(s) has had an enduring presence throughout human experience. This course takes up this perennial human question from the context of some of the world&rsquo;s major religious traditions including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism. What similarities do these great traditions share, and how does their understanding of the sacred differ? Additionally, the course explores the relation between reason and faith. How does the empirical verification characteristic of an increasingly pervasive scientific and technological worldview impact on belief in God(s)? Readings for the course are drawn from a variety of disciplines with a focus on primary sources and seminal works.

CORES-AD 37W Slavery and Freedom in Comparative Perspective                                             This course examines slavery in historical and comparative perspective by focusing on Greek and Roman slavery, African and Islamic slavery, and slavery in the American South, Brazil, and the Caribbean. We will examine the nature and centrality of the institution of slavery, the difference between societies in which slavery existed and those which can be thought of as &ldquo;slave societies, &ldquo; asking such questions as how did enslavement occur and who were the people enslaved and in what ways were did they differ from non-slaves? What &ldquo;rights&rdquo; or standing in the law if any did slaves possess? What was the nature and extent of the master&rsquo;s power over their slaves? What were the social, economic and political functions of slavery? These are important questions for understanding slavery. But the study of slavery inevitably involves broader, more fundamental issues concerning freedom, personhood, social inclusion and belonging. As Orlando Patterson put it in the most far-reaching study of slavery, Slavery and Social Death, &ldquo;the idea of freedom and the concept of property were both intimately bound up with the rise of slavery, their very antithesis. Once we understand the dynamics of slavery, we immediately realize why there is nothing in the least anomalous about the fact that an Aristotle or a Jefferson owned slaves.\"                      This course is writing intensive .

This course poses the fundamental questions: &ldquo;What is law?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What is a legal system?; and &ldquo;What is the rule of law?&rdquo; Appreciating that law reflects different cultural and historical facts, the course employs a comparative methodology in order to explore the fundamental questions from the perspective of various legal traditions. This comparative methodology considers jurisprudence from African, Chinese, Hindu, Marxist, Islamic, Southeast Asian, and Western legal traditions. In relation to these diverse legal traditions, the course examines the topics of natural law, legal positivism, interpretivism, legal realism, justice, human rights, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, critical race theory, and post-modernist jurisprudence.

CORES-AD 39W Revolutions and Social Change                                             Revolutions, i.e. the rapid, massive and often violent change in the political and economic arrangements of society, mark the modern epoch starting with England in the 1640s, America in 1776, and France in 1789. Revolutions obviously continue today. But what are revolution&rsquo;s causes, typical course and consequences? Why such passion and energy? A systematic comparison of different revolutions informed by both the classical and contemporary theories of revolution might offer a few startling insights.

CORES-AD 40 Corruption                                             Political corruption exists everywhere, but which countries are most corrupt? Do highly corrupt countries have common characteristics? How much corruption is there? The social costs of political corruption, from stealing public funds to paying bribes to avoid basic safety and healthy regulations, are often extremely high. Why are most attempts to fight corruption unsuccessful? The course is comparative and historical, and as far as possible requires no background knowledge.

CORES-AD 42 Economics of Everyday Life                                             There is the economics of economists, highfalutin and opaque theoretical models, and then there is economic activity as we experience it in our everyday lives and settings. Between the two stands a wall of incomprehension. From work to love, from social networks to family life, consumption, money, witchcraft, slavery, digital economies, slums, and ghettos, these spheres of everyday life ask us hard questions about the nature of the economic realities we inhabit. This course will seek to explore the everyday life of economic experience in a way that can capture its richness, diversity, and complexity. To that end, we will be drawing on a range of sources, from classical philosophy, to journalism, sociology, anthropology, manga, film, history, literature and even economics in search of a few answers.

CORES-AD 43 Ideology                                             What is an ideology? How do a series of sometimes disparate beliefs about issues come together to form an ideology? How do ideologies change and reform over time? In this course, we explore these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. We begin by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, we read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Robespierre, Burke, Jefferson, Marx, Lenin, Mosca, and (Benedict) Anderson. Thereafter, we look at how to measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter). In the last part of the course, we examine how shifting ideologies beliefs have (or might have) consequences for a wide range of human phenomena, ranging from interpersonal interactions to elections and international conflict.

Searching for what anthropologist Mary Douglas called &ldquo;an anthropology of consumption,&rdquo; we will look across history and places, to pre-modern Japan, Renaissance England, the contemporary UAE and North America. We ask about the politics of things and their shifting roles in everyday life. What is the nature of taste? of shopping? How do shifts occur depending on object, place, and time? We will explore the logistics of fashion, the link between goods and geography, production systems, and distribution through retail markets. We stretch theoretically across the political economy of Marx, neo-classical economics, and the more recent cultural-social schemas of Bruno Latour and Howard Becker. For a final project students will focus on a specific object that they research and present to class, based on readings, discussions and original research.

CORES-AD 45 Language and Thought                                             The course is about the nature of language, of thought, and of the relation between them. Among the questions to be asked are: Are there such things as meanings , and if so, what sorts of things are they? How do the meanings of linguistic expressions depend on the speech acts the expressions are used to perform? Is linguistic representation to be explained in terms of mental representation? Vice versa? Or is neither to be explained in terms of the other? How from a finite stock of words is it possible for a language to construct an infinite number of sentences, each with its own meaning? How is it possible for a child to acquire&mdash;in just a few years and without any instruction&mdash;the ability to understand indefinitely many sentences never previously encountered by herself or anyone else? In grappling with these and other questions we will study work in philosophy, theoretical linguistics and cognitive psychology.

CORES-AD 46 Global Population                                             Population is a basic parameter of the society. The size, composition, and distribution of a population may change over time. This course sets out to understand the causes and consequences of population change across the globe, and engage the students in ongoing debates over population policies. Population change takes shape by births, deaths, and migration. These fundamental population processes are influenced by institutions of marriage, education, health care, and the economy. Population change may lead to different cultural phenomena and individual behaviors and varying levels of economic development. It may also have implications for the distribution of human welfare, which may in turn elicit perception of injustice and even political action. We will engage the interdisciplinary scholarship on global population, and contemplate issues faced by different countries. We will emphasize general principles that help us understand global population change, and try to come up with policy solutions to related issues.

CORES-AD 48 Subjectivity                                             Human beings differ from machines, and perhaps also from other animals, in the way we encounter the world&mdash;always from a first-personal perspective, an awareness of oneself in the world and not merely of the world. But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, by finding some particular function of the brain? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called &ldquo;the human condition&rdquo;? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any single other topic, have had something important to say. We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek and Jaina intellectual cultures, and look critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovskiy; and at dissenters from Vasubandhu to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion&mdash;or, worse, a deceit.

CORES-AD 49 The Great Divergence                                             In 1500 the economic, social, and political differences between Europe and Asia were small. By the twentieth century, the gaps were enormous. How can we explain this Great Divergence between Europe and Asia? The course will discuss the classical answers to this question given by Weber, Smith, Marx, and Malthus. Has modern research confirmed or contradicted their views? The roles of demography, politics, law, globalization, social structure, science, and technology will be discussed as well as the interconnections between them. The course aims to expose the methods that social scientists and historians use to answer grand questions of social evolution, so that the approaches can be compared, contrasted, and assessed.

CORES-AD 50 Emotions                                             Emotions have been understood since Antiquity to stand at the heart of human motivation and agency, as well as to influence diverse facets of the human condition, from family formation, empathy, and socialization, to choice-making, aggression, and war. Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical, and social-engineering projects, and the collusion of emotional and political regimes, it further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants, beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. Course readings include works by Homer, Aristotle, Dharmak\u012brti, Ibn Sina, Abelard and Heloise, Shigesuke, Descartes, Spinoza, Campe, Darwin, and Freud, as well as relevant secondary scholarship.

CORES-AD 51 Shame and Guilt                                             We will read and discuss works of major writers to explore the role that the moral emotions, shame and guilt, have played and still play, in our individual and collective lives. We will ask whether these two emotive forces are parallel or antagonistic in their effects on our behavior. We will apply the concepts of shame and guilt to the understanding of psychology and moral value systems, and of different patterns of culture and politics. We will attempt to understand how shame and guilt can both serve adaptive (life-supporting) as well as maladaptive (life-destroying) functions. Finally, we will ask whether developing the capacity to love can enable us to transcend the destructive outcomes that both shame and guilt, and the ethical systems they motivate, can generate. Authors studied will include Homer, Sophocles, the Bible, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Freud, Ruth Benedict, Pierre Bourdieu, Salman Rushdie and Kanan Makiya.

It will particularly consider various attempts to say what the &lsquo;aim&rsquo; or &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; of life might be. Readings will be from a range of sources, philosophical, scientific, and literary. We begin with biological life (how to distinguish living from non-living entities; the &ldquo;units&rdquo; and &ldquo;levels&rdquo; of life). We then turn to a more &ldquo;biographical&rdquo; notion of life, applying especially to human lives. (Is there a natural or typical structure to &ldquo;a life&rdquo;? Is the unity of a life a matter of degree, and what does it depend on? Is narration the best way to describe or understand a life? ) Finally we turn to the value of life and lives. (Does all life have value, and by virtue of what? Does each human life have absolute value, or is it legitimate to compare and rank the values of different lives?) Readings will include works or extracts by Aristotle, Euripides, Whitman, Darwin, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Sartre, as well as religious texts such as The Bhagavad-Gita, the Diamond Sutra, and the Tao Te Ching.

CORES-AD 53J What is a Religion?                                             Course description: Most English-speaking people can answer the question, &ldquo;What is your religion?&rdquo; &hellip; even if the answer is &ldquo;I am an atheist, so I don&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo; Yet the things we call religions are remarkably diverse. They differ, for example, in whether they address one God, no gods or many; how important they think explicit creeds are; how much attention they give to prayer, fasting and other rituals; and whether adherents are expected to dress or eat or engage in other everyday practices in a distinctive way. In this course we&rsquo;ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science&mdash;E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim.

CORES-AD 54J Surveillance and Privacy                                             This multidisciplinary course examines the historical, sociological, cultural, and political significance of surveillance, with a particular focus on the relationship between surveillance and privacy. Drawing on a wide range of sources (&shy;including academic research, historical documents, literature, film, and social media), the course explores how developments in the practice and technologies of surveillance have shaped the ways in which we think about privacy, identity, and personal information over the last 3000 years. Among the central questions that animate the course are: What is the relationship between surveillance and governance? How has the emergence of various forms of electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about identity and individual privacy? How do we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security in a world characterized by increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of state and private surveillance? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, paying particular attention to the ways in which certain major events (such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States) have shaped how we think about surveillance and its relationship to privacy, security, and democracy.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

CORES-AD 55 Labor                                             How has labor - and our attitude towards it - evolved from subsistence farming and slavery? What happened in the industrial revolution and which changes are brought about in the new digital age? What role have institutions and religions played in attitudes toward labor? How does education affect work/life satisfaction, wages, and mobility? Why do so many people choose not to work &ldquo;in the market&rdquo;, and at the same time, why in happiness surveys is job loss often ranked similar in severity to the death of a close relative or divorce? These are some of the questions we will discuss in this class when we study how the role of and attitude towards labor has changed.

This class will explore human, natural and political boundaries as processes accompanying genetic, linguistic, religious and cultural divergence. It will also investigate changing boundaries over time in various regions to see how these changes explain both socioeconomic and political outcomes today. Students will be exposed to various interdisciplinary literature, and will learn to create their own digital maps using both archival and contemporary resources. They will also work with these novel data to present their own research ideas.

CORES-AD 58 Randomness                                             Does randomness actually exist, or is it a human theoretical construction? How does our understanding of randomness condition our ability to make sense of the world? This course will explore the role of randomness in human experience and agency, probing how our understanding of chance affects how we produce meaning and knowledge. We start by looking at how early cultures thought about and reacted to randomness and also consider later efforts to reify uncertainty with mathematics. Then, we will examine how scientists and artists manipulate chance in their work, and build on those efforts using interactive simulations and course projects.

CORES-AD 60 Colonialism and Post-Colonialism                                             Until very recently much of the world has lived under colonial rule. Major colonial powers shaped social, religious, and institutional life in countries that they controlled. This course explores the legacies of colonial rule. Do some colonial-era institutions and practices tend to persist into the present, while others are likely to disappear? What are the conditions under which persistence of institutions and practices is more likely? What does such persistence mean for the social, political, and economic well-being of former colonies today? We engage with these and related questions through the prism of related literatures in political science, economics, and history. First, we explore the motivations of colonizing powers and their methods. We then consider the colonial experience from the perspective of populations being colonized. Most of the course is dedicated to exploring the impact of colonial institutions and practices on contemporary levels of development, inequality, and conflict in the former colonies.

CORES-AD 62 Money                                             The need to trade goods and services within and across time is a requirement for the basic functioning of any society. When barter systems do not satisfy needs, the ability to engage in such trades requires a peculiar sort of good, namely, money. In this course we begin with the theory of money, why one uses either barter, commodity or fiat monies, and the functions money serves. We trace the history of the development of money and credit across societies to the present day. We explore the centrality of money to various cultures and its representation in the arts. We discuss governmental manipulation of aggregate monetary stocks to spur or dampen trade; or historically to finance conflict by debasing the value represented by this peculiar good. We explore a central truth, that while modern money is intrinsically meaningless, its role in facilitating economic growth in the supply of real goods and services is surprisingly robust, provided policy does not deliver problems when too much money and credit is in circulation.

CORES-AD 64 Justice in Theory and Practice                                              This course invites students to engage with historical and contemporary treatises about a universal concern: justice. To what extent are our social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know? In this course, we explore the ideal of a just society as understood across cultures, communities, and time &ndash; from the earliest recorded histories of the Arabian Peninsula, the Iranian Plateau, the Indian subcontinent, and the European continent to present day works. Through careful reading of primary texts, we consider what place the values of group integrity, liberty and equality occupy in conceptions of what constitutes a just society. We then apply these insights to inquiries into our own local communities and practices.

CORES-AD 68 Religion and Society                                             In this seminar, students explore the diverse and dynamic manifestations of religion in social life&mdash;as a personal and collective experience, an individual and group identity, and a code for moral behavior&mdash;and examine how these social uses of religion impact various spheres of society. After considering classic social theories of religion, we will look at substantive cases from the United States, Egypt, Iran, China, and Venezuela to investigate how and why religious meanings and identities come to matter (or not) in arenas of gender equality, political mobilization, nationstate structures, everyday intergroup interactions, and the law and punishment. Overall, this course aims to provide students with the theoretical frameworks and substantive background necessary to analyze the workings of religion and religious identity in modern societies.

His careful observations gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices, and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. We explore seven wonders of the invisible world&mdash; natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins and naturally occurring crystals.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.

COREX-AD 43 Behavior                                             Why we behave in a certain way is one of the most fascinating and complex questions and one that we often cannot even explain to ourselves. So what drives behavior? How can behavior be measured? And can behavior be changed? This course will examine behavior from the viewpoints of biology, neuroscience, economics, psychology and philosophy. We will place an emphasis on interpreting and designing experiments that measure behavior in both humans and animals. We will discuss topics as diverse as memory, morality and altruism and examine how being part of small and large groups can affect decision-making and behavior.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.

COREX-AD 54 Diversity                                             This course will investigate two fundamental concepts: Identity, &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo;, and Diversity, &ldquo;How am I different from other human beings?&rdquo; These questions will be addressed from cultural, environmental and biological perspectives. We will examine the origin of human diversity, how human diversity is measured and analyzed, and how our perception of diversity has changed through history. Emphasis will be placed on recent progress in genetics and evolution and how this progress affects our daily life and identity. Students will learn how genes can inform us about human history, ancestry and evolution. The laboratory component of the course will demonstrate how data are generated and analyzed, and will explore the difficulty encountered by scientists in inferring processes from observations and experiments. Students will have the option to collect and analyze genetic data from their own genome.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.

COREX-AD 60 Observing the Universe                                             Observation is always the first step in the scientific process, usually followed by hypotheses and experimental tests. In astronomy, observation is nearly the only way to get data and test theories. For most of human history, astronomical observations were done using the human eye aided by simple instruments. The early telescopes were also aids to the human eye. It wasn&#39;t until photography was invented in the late 19th century that astronomy began to become independent of an individual observer&#39;s eyes. In this class, we will explore the development of our understanding of the Universe through the historical development of observational tools and techniques. We will start with the instruments of the ancients and progress to the modern era using data from today&#39;s most advanced observatories which are no longer limited to light our eyes can see. However, we are still limited almost exclusively to what the Universe chooses to show us through electromagnetic or other types of radiation, since even our deepest space probes have only barely left the solar system. This course will entail several observations at night.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.    *Please note: There will be some additional meetings in the evenings to be arranged between the faculty and the students.

We engage class and contemporary urban questions such as: How does city-living shape our minds and shift our patterns of social interaction? How does the built environment relate to the local ecology and our experience of everyday life? How are civic and political institutions addressing emerging problems related to massive population growth, sprawl, pollution, and polarization? Students should be prepared for rigorous critical thinking and vigorous participation.
