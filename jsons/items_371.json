M-Th 9:30-10:45 TBA 002. M-Th 3:30-4:45, Ari Zatlin \u2028Continuation of Elementary Latin I. Introduction to the essentials of Latin vocabulary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Latin rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 006, Intermediate Latin II: Reading Poetry 001. M, T, Th 9:30-10:45, Benjamin Sammons 002. M, T, W 3:30-4:45, Stefano Rebeggiani Writings of the greatest Roman poet, focusing on the most generally read portions of his most celebrated poem, the Aeneid. The meter of the poem is studied, and the student learns to read Latin metrically to reflect the necessary sound for full appreciation of the writing. Readings in political and literary history illustrate the setting in the Augustan Age in which the Aeneid was written and enjoyed, the relationship of the poem to the CLASS-UA 008, Elementary Ancient Greek I I, M-Th 11:00-12:15, Benjamin Sammons Introduction to the complex but highly beautiful language of ancient Greece--the language of Homer, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato. Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabul ary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek II: Homer , M,T,W 12:30-1:45, Stefano Rebeggiani Extensive readings from the Iliad or Odyssey. Proficiency in Homeric grammar is expected, as well as a good command of Homeric vocabulary; the course will also address scansion and metre in Homeric epic. Relevant topics ranging from the problems of oral tradition to questions of heroism. CLASS-UA 243, identical to HIST-UA 243 &amp; HEL-UA 243, Greek World:Alexander-Augustus , M&amp;W 11:00-12:15, Andrew Monson Alexander the Great\u2019s conquest of the Persian Empire brought Greeks to the edges of their known world and brought great prosperity back to Greece. The centuries of cultural efflorescence that began after Alexander\u2019s death were mixed with intense warfare, as his generals seized territory, established dynasties, and battled for dominance. While Greeks colonized the east, their interaction with non-Greeks stimulated new religious, intellectual, and social movements. Meanwhile, emerging empires on the periphery of the Greek world posed new challenges: Romans and Carthaginians in the west, Indians and Parthians in the east. The course examines these times down to the Roman unification of the Mediterranean under Augustus. CLASS-UA278, identical to HIST-UA206, History of Rome: Empire, T&amp;Th 2:00-3:15, Michael Peachin In the spring of 44 B.C.E., Julius Caesar was murdered by a group of senators disgruntled with his monarchic ways. However, Caesar's adoptive son and heir, Gaius Octavius, was quickly on the scene, and over the course of the next half-century managed to establish himself as Rome's first emperor. About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. CLASS-UA 291.001, Classics and Cognitive Theory , Thursday 3:30-6:05, Peter Meineck The course examines how cognitive science, cognitive theoretical approaches and neuroscience is being applied to the study of the ancient world. We will explore new approaches ancient material culture, performance and literature, aesthetics, language, ancient concepts of the mind and social psychology. Ideally the class will be made up of a mixture of students with a primary interest in the sciences and also those interested in the arts and humanities and the field is interdisciplinary. No specialized knowledge of the ancient world, classical languages or cognitive science is required. The class will involve guest speakers, field trips and final research presentations.  CLASS-UA 291.002, Ancient Trials: Real &amp; Imagined , M&amp;W 12:30-1:45, Benjamin Sammons This is a course on judicial trials as a feature of life in ancient Greece and Rome and as a major theme in the myth, literature and fictions of these societies. In real life, trials were highly dramatic events marking moments of crisis in which not only a defendant but often the fundamental values of society stood at jeopardy. But the trial also exercised the ancient imagination as a narrative pattern or story type that could implicate characters from every cosmic and political echelon, from gods, heroes and statesmen, to prostitutes, ruffians and assorted dregs of society. We will discuss real-life trials through the works of actual participants (e.g., Lysias, Andocides, Demosthenes, Cicero), but we will also look at the trial as a theme in mythology, literature, drama and philosophy. We will examine the interpenetration of key themes between these different spheres, especially the influence of law and jurisprudence on literature, the exploitation of literary motifs in forensic rhetoric, and the mutual influence between the courts and the dramatic stage. Authors will include Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Plato, Aristotle, Ovid, Seneca, and Apuleius.  CLASS-UA 293.001, Plato , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15, Vincent Renzi Some major dialogues of Plato, with special attention to situating these works in the genre of the Socratic discourse, comparison to Xenophon and Isocrates, and the ways in which they seek to reimagine the Greek \u201cwisdom tradition.\u201d Intended both for majors and minors in Classics as well as students from other disciplines seeking an introduction to Plato. Readings in English translation. CLASS-UA 293.002, identical to HEL-UA 140, Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance , T 3:30-6:05, Olga Taxidou Ovid's Latin is ideal for empowering your reading skills in Latin, and his style is a good introduction to all the later tradition of writing in Latin (Imperial, Medieval, and early modern). At the same time the poem is a portal to Greek myth, and the only fictional Latin text that provides names and heroes to psychoanalisis (Narcissus) and gender studies. Reading Ovid therefore has both a futuristic and a retrospective kind of reward.\u2028The class is designed for those who want to improve their Latin while at the same time learning about ancient culture and in particular its imaginary and the sensual world of mythological fiction. CLASS-UA294.001, Violence, Crime &amp; Punishment in Ancient Rome , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15 Michael Peachin The ancient Roman world was, in many different respects, a violent one. There seems to have been a reasonably high level of interpersonal violence, often not to be remedied easily. In particular, police or police-like forces, were not at all universally present. The institution of slavery also resulted in a great deal of violence. Entertainments, both public ones and those, which were held in private, very often involved significant levels of violence. Punishments carried out by the state played a significant role here. And then, there was warfare. In this course, we will attempt to get a sense of the various areas of Roman life, which were in one way or another affected by the presence of violent behavior. Students will be required to write several papers over the course of the term, and grades will be based on these. CLASS-UA302, identical to RELST-UA 302, Introduction to the New Testament , M&amp;W 9:30-10:45, Adam Becker Introduces students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament, as well as other important early Christian documents. Students are given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament text in a lecture-hall setting where the professor provides historical context and focuses on significant issues, describes modern scholarly methodologies, and places the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion.  CLASS-UA 404, Identical to RELST-UA 404.001, Mythology , T&amp;Th 11:00-12:15 Peter Meineck This course is an examination of the meaning, form and function of Greek and Roman mythology especially its transmission via the literature, art and material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world. We explore the way in which these stories operated in Greek and Roman culture and seek to understand what they were articulating in contemporary social, political, military, economic and artistic life. Consequently, a number of ancient texts will be read in translation and set against iconographic evidence from vase paintings, sculpture and architecture. The course begins by surveying the various ways in which mythology has been catalogued and studied from the ancient mythographers to Freud, Propp. Levi-Strauss, and Burkert Then ancient texts are used to explore how myth developed throughout the classical period. These will include Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod\u2019s Work and Days and Theogony, the Homeric hymns to the gods, Greek tragedy and comedy, Virgil\u2019s Aeneid and Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses. The influence of mythology on the works of Chaucer, Shakespeare and in film will also be discussed. The class meets twice a week and students are expected to complete bi-weekly readings, contribute to in class discussion. CLASS-UA 876, Advanced Latin: Historiography , T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, David Levene We will be reading Book 4 of Tacitus' Annals, the most famous work by the man widely considered to be the greatest historian of ancient Rome. Tacitus examined with cynical insight the inner workings of the Roman Empire in its early days, especially under the tyrannical rule of the Emperor Tiberius, whose enigmatic character Tacitus devotes much of the surviving work to exploring. Book 4 recounts the turn to disaster in the second half of Tiberius' reign, as the Emperor falls under the sway of his manipulative and brutal lieutenant Sejanus. CLASS-UA 976, Advanced Greek: Hellensitic Poetry , M&amp;W 9:30-10:45, David Sider In this class we will read some well known and some less famous poems produced in the Hellenistic period (323 - 30 BC), inlcuding epigrams, hymns, and eclogues. Some of the authors to be read art Theocritus, Callimachus, and Apollonius.                                                                                                 Back to Top"}]}]
