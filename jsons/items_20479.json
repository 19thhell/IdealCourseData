Distinguished lecturers are brought to NYU School of Law each year to discuss a timely issue that may arise from recent or proposed legislation, regulations, cases or IRS rulings.   The series is a unique venture that brings together academics from NYU School of Law and distinguished tax advisors from KPMG. Representatives from each institution serve as panelists to comment on the lecture from their different professional perspectives. At a time when in some quarters there is tension between the academy and private practice, the NYU School of Law/KPMG lectures demonstrate that the two branches of the tax discipline can work together effectively to provide the highest level consideration of current tax issues.   Our goals are to ensure that each year's lecture is the intellectual highlight of the student's year at NYU School of Law and to provide high quality continuing legal education for alumni of the NYU School of Law Graduate Tax Program and KPMG partners and associates. These goals epitomize the balance between academic insight and practical experience that the GTP strives to achieve. The goal and expectations of NYU School of Law and KPMG are that the Lectures on Current Issues in Taxation will be recognized as the premier resource to which students, teachers and practitioners look for in-depth analysis and discussion of the most important issues in taxation in the United States.

Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them , schools around the world began the process of exposing global issues to middle and high school students, calling on them to push forward solutions thereto.   Five years after the Global Issues Network's inception, NYU Abu Dhabi took the platform to a new level in January 2013. For the first time, motivated college undergraduates and gifted high school students from all over the world were invited to the United Arab Emirates to participate in NYUAD's inaugural GIN2013 conference .     This Year's Conference   The GIN2014 conference at NYU Abu Dhabi is an international gathering of emerging leaders who share a passion and drive to create innovative solutions to some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues. GIN2014 challenges delegates to use six different regions of the world as case studies to develop distinct, sustainable action plans that address issues in the following areas:     Peacekeeping   Global Warming   Poverty   Education   Healthcare   Energy     GIN attracts some of the best and the brightest students from across the globe. Be ready to innovate, as our action plans can and will be implemented within a six-month time frame after the conference. In order to support the diversity and ideals of this three-day conference, we request each university send only a small delegation. Furthermore, NYU Abu Dhabi hopes to set a precedent through GIN by creating a format and structure that can be used around the world, whether in New York, Shanghai, London, Rio de Janeiro, Manila, or Los Angeles.     Delegates will be selected through an online application process, which is slated to go live within the next few months.

Distinguished lecturers are brought to NYU School of Law each year to discuss a timely issue that may arise from recent or proposed legislation, regulations, cases or IRS rulings.   The series is a unique venture that brings together academics from NYU School of Law and distinguished tax advisors from KPMG. Representatives from each institution serve as panelists to comment on the lecture from their different professional perspectives. At a time when in some quarters there is tension between the academy and private practice, the NYU School of Law/KPMG lectures demonstrate that the two branches of the tax discipline can work together effectively to provide the highest level consideration of current tax issues.   Our goals are to ensure that each year's lecture is the intellectual highlight of the student's year at NYU School of Law and to provide high quality continuing legal education for alumni of the NYU School of Law Graduate Tax Program and KPMG partners and associates. These goals epitomize the balance between academic insight and practical experience that the GTP strives to achieve. The goal and expectations of NYU School of Law and KPMG are that the Lectures on Current Issues in Taxation will be recognized as the premier resource to which students, teachers and practitioners look for in-depth analysis and discussion of the most important issues in taxation in the United States.

Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them , schools around the world began the process of exposing global issues to middle and high school students, calling on them to push forward solutions thereto.   Five years after the Global Issues Network's inception, NYU Abu Dhabi took the platform to a new level in January 2013. For the first time, motivated college undergraduates and gifted high school students from all over the world were invited to the United Arab Emirates to participate in NYUAD's inaugural GIN2013 conference .     This Year's Conference   The GIN2014 conference at NYU Abu Dhabi is an international gathering of emerging leaders who share a passion and drive to create innovative solutions to some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues. GIN2014 challenges delegates to use six different regions of the world as case studies to develop distinct, sustainable action plans that address issues in the following areas:     Peacekeeping   Global Warming   Poverty   Education   Healthcare   Energy     GIN attracts some of the best and the brightest students from across the globe. Be ready to innovate, as our action plans can and will be implemented within a six-month time frame after the conference. In order to support the diversity and ideals of this three-day conference, we request each university send only a small delegation. Furthermore, NYU Abu Dhabi hopes to set a precedent through GIN by creating a format and structure that can be used around the world, whether in New York, Shanghai, London, Rio de Janeiro, Manila, or Los Angeles.     Delegates will be selected through an online application process, which is slated to go live within the next few months.
