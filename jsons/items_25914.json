Learn more about CRISP .    Program Director : Pamela Fraser-Abder Contact Info: East Building, Suite 635 Phone : 212-998-5870    This program is designed to meet the needs of several types of students:       First, it comprises an initial certificate teacher education program for teachers of science at the precollege level.    Second, the professional program in science education provides an excellent opportunity for those who are presently teaching in schools or colleges to develop additional expertise in specific areas such as curriculum development, supervision, research, technology in science education, or science, technology, and society.    Third, because of its concentration of courses focused on strategies for teaching science to urban students, this program provides an excellent opportunity for involving teachers in techniques for increasing participation in science by women and minorities.       Financial Aid Opportunities    There are a number of opportunities for financial assistance for those pursuing graduate studies in math or science education at New York University. Many of these scholarships are for minority, in-service teachers of math and science. Scholarships may be applied for by submitting an application to the Math, Science and Technology Enhancement Program (MSTEP). Agencies that provide support under MSTEP include, The Teacher Opportunity Corps (TOC), the Teaching and Learning Quality Partnership grants (TLQP) and the Jewish Women Scholars program.    Career Opportunities    Severe shortages of science teachers at all levels have been forecast for the foreseeable future. This program provides the foundation for entering science education at an excellent time.    Graduates teach at both private and public schools. However, science communication skills are the basis for a variety of careers outside the formal school system as well. Newspapers and magazines, radio and television, museums and science centers, science and technology-based organizations, and corporations all need people who have a sound science background and can communicate scientific ideas to the general public    Lesson Plan Area                                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

Program Director : Pamela Fraser-Abder Contact Info: East Building, Suite 635 Phone : 212-998-5870    This program is designed to meet the needs of several types of students:       First, it comprises an initial certificate teacher education program for teachers of science at the precollege level.    Second, the professional program in science education provides an excellent opportunity for those who are presently teaching in schools or colleges to develop additional expertise in specific areas such as curriculum development, supervision, research, technology in science education, or science, technology, and society.    Third, because of its concentration of courses focused on strategies for teaching science to urban students, this program provides an excellent opportunity for involving teachers in techniques for increasing participation in science by women and minorities.       Financial Aid Opportunities    There are a number of opportunities for financial assistance for those pursuing graduate studies in math or science education at New York University. Many of these scholarships are for minority, in-service teachers of math and science. Scholarships may be applied for by submitting an application to the Math, Science and Technology Enhancement Program (MSTEP). Agencies that provide support under MSTEP include, The Teacher Opportunity Corps (TOC), the Teaching and Learning Quality Partnership grants (TLQP) and the Jewish Women Scholars program.    Career Opportunities    Severe shortages of science teachers at all levels have been forecast for the foreseeable future. This program provides the foundation for entering science education at an excellent time.    Graduates teach at both private and public schools. However, science communication skills are the basis for a variety of careers outside the formal school system as well. Newspapers and magazines, radio and television, museums and science centers, science and technology-based organizations, and corporations all need people who have a sound science background and can communicate scientific ideas to the general public    Lesson Plan Area                                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

   NYUAD Center for Science and Engineering (CSE)                                  The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of modern scientific research requires that biologists, chemists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists have a fundamental understanding of one another's areas. It is important for students engaged in these areas to understand and experience multiple scientific disciplines and their interrelationships.                               Foundations of Science     Foundations of Science is an innovative program that responds to the nature of modern science. Instead of the traditional series of discipline-specific introductory courses, Foundations integrates basic concepts from biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics in a demanding three-semester sequence. The program fosters discussion among students and creates a collaborative learning dynamic. Problem-solving and group work in laboratory sessions are stressed, while close contact among students and faculty is a major feature of the program. The interdisciplinary approach and experimental work foster a more comprehensive understanding of science.   All science and engineering students (except those majoring in Psychology) are required to take Foundations of Science, which is a six-course sequence. Students intending to major in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics normally start Foundations of Science in the first semester of the first year. Mathematics and Computer Science majors have the option to begin the program in their second year. Psychology majors are not required to take Foundations of Science.   Foundations of Science is geared to meet the current demand for scientists with well-integrated backgrounds who become the leaders in modern scientific scholarship and who pursue careers in research, education, industry, health care, law, business, and publishing.   Students who elect to begin the Foundations of Science series in their sophomore year with the intention to major in the sciences have several options for completing their degree. They may take additional courses over the summer at sites within NYU\u2019s global network; they may take more than four courses per semester; or they may need an additional fifth year of study at NYUAD. These options must be considered carefully by the student and the faculty mentors.                                                                  Computer Science in Today&#39;s World                                                    A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in a context of broad general learning. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees.                                                              Biology Major                                                    The major in Biology offers students the opportunity to learn introductory science in an integrated format in the Foundations of Science program and to use the contemporary tools and approaches that are available to solve problems in areas of the current life sciences.
