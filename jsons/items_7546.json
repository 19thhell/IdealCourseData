Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

The Glory of Medieval France: Museums and Monuments in Paris and the Region - ARTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               This course examines medieval art and architecture of France through an exploration of the monuments and moments that define our understanding of the period. The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

It is organized in survey fashion as a broad introduction to some of the major artistic movements of the past two centuries\u2014symbolism, realism, naturalism, modernism, surrealism, existentialism, and the New Wave of the sixties. Literary texts, both in poetry and prose, will be read in conjunction with the viewing of relevant films. By studying the past history of representations of Paris in literature and film, it is hoped that students will achieve a heightened awareness of the daily life that goes on around them in the present.    Authors to be read include Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, C\u00e9line, Queneau, and Perec. The movies include works by Bunuel, Vigo, Malle, Godard, Truffaut, and Varda.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation.

This course starts with a study of Gallo-Roman Paris (52-253 A.D.), highlighting archaeological artifacts, temples, thermal baths and theatres. Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.                                                                    Theater in the French Tradition - FREN-UA 9929 - 4 points                               In this course we explore contemporary French theatre in relation to the broader tradition of French dramaturgy, to consider how contemporary works both continue and break with the great works of the past. We take as our point of departure the major playwrights of the modern and contemporary period \u2013 Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad \u2013 in order to consider how writers of the 20th and 21st centuries position themselves in relation to the great dramaturges that preceded them -- Corneille, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais, Hugo. Thus we examine, for example, how Jean-Paul Sartre affirms his place in relation to Corneille but in opposition to Racine, how Cocteau or Giraudoux look to antiquity for inspiration, how Koltes steeps himself in classical tragedy to shape his dramatic vision. Theatre outings constitute a regular feature of the course, allowing us to consider major texts and their realization on stage.

We consider art as it has been inspired by the written word (the Bible, mythology, epic poetry), art as inspired by and inspirational to literary works (Paul Val\u00e9ry and Degas, Jean Genet and Alberto Giacometti), art as a response to and initiator of 20th century crises in representation, both written and visual (Cubism, Dada, Surrealism). Drawing on the multiple art resources in and around Paris, the course will urge us to reflect on the meanings and signs of language, in its many forms. Conducted in French.

Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course. Conducted in French.

Direct Enrollment at French Partner Universities   NYUParis students may enroll in one or more courses offered at the University of Paris schools with which we have partner agreements (University of Paris I, III, VII, X), and at specialized schools (Institut d\u2019E\u0301tudes Politiques, otherwise known as Sciences Po).   Courses available in English are offered within the Departments of Anglo-American Studies and examine various aspects of culture and civilization of the English-speaking world.    Courses offered in French are selected from the following departments: French and Comparative Literature, History, Art History, Sociology, Studio Art, Cinema, Political Science. Students must either have taken or be currently enrolled in Written Contemporary French to take a course in French at the University of Paris. In addition, students complement their coursework in individualized tutorial sessions with a tutor at NYUParis.     Students may only take courses at the University in which they are administratively enrolled (with the exception of Sciences Po - see below). You will be asked to choose which university you prefer when filling out your visa questionnaire from the Office of Global Services.    Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above). Past course offerings are listed here for reference only. Please keep in mind that finalized course lists and times will not be available until your arrival in Paris.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

The Glory of Medieval France: Museums and Monuments in Paris and the Region - ARTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               This course examines medieval art and architecture of France through an exploration of the monuments and moments that define our understanding of the period. The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture. Taught in English.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

French films and French culture, examined by situating the films in their social, historical, and philosophical context. Topics include the relationship between the Avant-garde artistic movements of the early 20th century (futurism, cubism, expressionism, surrealism) and the cinematographic Avant-garde (Bu\u00f1uel, L\u2019Herbier, Cocteau), the echoes of classical French theatre (Marivaux, Beaumarchais, Musset) in the cinema of Renoir, the troubled period of the German Occupation and the work of filmmakers who deliberately chose to stay in France to continue their calling (Clouzot, Carn\u00e9), and the influence of the existentialist circles of Saint Germain des Pr\u00e9s (Sartre, Camus) on the Nouvelle Vague.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

The course will focus on the diversity of resources provided by the city, with special attention to new artistic practices and loci of production, as well as the multiple actors involved, from artists themselves to private galleries to art critics and museum curators.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

It is organized in survey fashion as a broad introduction to some of the major artistic movements of the past two centuries\u2014symbolism, realism, naturalism, modernism, surrealism, existentialism, and the New Wave of the sixties. Literary texts, both in poetry and prose, will be read in conjunction with the viewing of relevant films. By studying the past history of representations of Paris in literature and film, it is hoped that students will achieve a heightened awareness of the daily life that goes on around them in the present.    Authors to be read include Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, C\u00e9line, Queneau, and Perec. The movies include works by Bunuel, Vigo, Malle, Godard, Truffaut, and Varda.                                                                      Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas. Classes include walking tours and site visits in and around Paris. Conducted in English.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.                                                                    Theater in the French Tradition - FREN-UA 9929 - 4 points                               In this course we explore contemporary French theatre in relation to the broader tradition of French dramaturgy, to consider how contemporary works both continue and break with the great works of the past. We take as our point of departure the major playwrights of the modern and contemporary period \u2013 Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad \u2013 in order to consider how writers of the 20th and 21st centuries position themselves in relation to the great dramaturges that preceded them -- Corneille, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais, Hugo. Thus we examine, for example, how Jean-Paul Sartre affirms his place in relation to Corneille but in opposition to Racine, how Cocteau or Giraudoux look to antiquity for inspiration, how Koltes steeps himself in classical tragedy to shape his dramatic vision. Theatre outings constitute a regular feature of the course, allowing us to consider major texts and their realization on stage. Conducted in French.

We consider art as it has been inspired by the written word (the Bible, mythology, epic poetry), art as inspired by and inspirational to literary works (Paul Val\u00e9ry and Degas, Jean Genet and Alberto Giacometti), art as a response to and initiator of 20th century crises in representation, both written and visual (Cubism, Dada, Surrealism). Drawing on the multiple art resources in and around Paris, the course will urge us to reflect on the meanings and signs of language, in its many forms. Conducted in French.

Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course. Conducted in French.

The two weekly class sessions will be devoted to group work in  sight-singing and dictation: melodic, rhythmic and harmonic -- and in listening to longer  segments of work to sharpen your perception of musical form. You will be expected to  keep up a regular practice of these skills outside of class. In addition, we will arrange  tutorials (at least three per semester) for individual work and assessment.    The musical materials of AC III will be taken mostly from 19th-century sources,  reinforcing your work in Music Theory and Music History III. We will also work with  more chromatic music of the 18th century, as well as jazz, popular music and relevant  world cultures.

We will go through harmonic instances of advanced chromaticism of the late 19. century and up to the very edge of tonality. Emphasis will be put on assignments and exercises in order to develop good creative and analytical  skills in harmony. Concurrently we will examine the main formal principles of tonal music and apply  our knowledge in analysis of selected compositions. We will use various analytical approaches and  test them on a large scale of historical musical material. Every student will be due to realize at least one analysis of assigned composition during the semester.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Not  a traditional survey, this  course opens with a brief consideration of the achievements of the great  pre-Hispanic civilizations (Aztec, Maya,  Inca,  and  others) prior to contact with the Iberian world. Major emphasis is given to  colonial painting, sculpture,  and  architecture in Mexico and Central America, the  Caribbean, and  the Andes. Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of  Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of  modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of  many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and  the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican  muralists, Frida  Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn  Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila  do Amaral, Wifredo  Lam, and  the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Offered every year. 4 points.    The  Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the  one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise  of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course  of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau,  celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual  expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense  emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism.  Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described  as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these  three stylistic movements, examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century  artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its  political consequences as well.
