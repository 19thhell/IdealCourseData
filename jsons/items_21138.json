An Examination of School-Level Funding in New York City (2009) Amy Ellen Schwartz, Ross Rubenstein, and Leanna Stiefel IESP Working Paper #09-10   In the spring of 2007, the New York City Department of Education announced an ambitious plan to change the way it distributes resources across its more than 1,400 schools. The plan, known as the &quot;Fair Student Funding&quot; initiative, is intended to change funding methods in two ways: first, by allocating money based upon characteristics of the student body that capture differences in the cost of providing appropriate educational services; second, by allocating dollars rather than specific resources, primarily teacher positions, and allowing principals greater discretion in the deployment of those resources. The authors examine the current distribution of resources across schools in New York City and consider what we know about the intradistrict allocation of resources.

Weinstein, Leanna Stiefel, Amy Ellen Schwartz and Luis Chalico IESP Working Paper #09-09  In this paper, the authors examine the impact of Title I on school spending and school performance, using New York City public school data. Based on a regression discontinuity design (RD) with panel data, and including separate analyses for elementary/middle and high schools, the authors estimate local average treatment effects of Title I. Overall, the results indicate that Title I changes the mix of spending, enabling high schools to significantly increase the amount of money they spend on direct services to students and to improve their pupil-teacher ratios (while reducing experienced teachers). Elementary and middle schools do not increase spending as much, which is consistent with our finding that state compensatory education funds may be supplanting some Title I funding in schools. Since schools just below the Title I cutoff are similar to those just above the cutoff, this finding may be an equitable, albeit unintended result. Finally, additional Title I spending does not improve the achievement of students and may even reduce school-wide average test scores in elementary and middle schools. These effects for both spending and scores seem to increase with the length of time schools are Title I eligible and to be stronger for ones that are always Title I eligible compared to those that go in and out of eligibility.

There is little relationship between state implementation of accountability systems and changes in school finance equity, though there is evidence that states in which courts overturned the school finance system during the decade exhibited significant equity improvements. Additionally, while implementation of accountability per se does not appear linked to changes in resource adequacy, states that implemented strong accountability systems did experience improvements.

This paper explores the determinants of resource allocation across schools in large districts based on factors that reflect differential school costs or factors that may, in practice, be related to the distribution of resources. Using detailed data on school resources and student and school characteristics in New York City, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, we find that schools with higher percentages of poor pupils often receive more money and have more teachers per pupil, but the teachers tend to be less educated and less well paid, with a particularly consistent pattern in New York City schools.

Weinstein, Leanna Stiefel, and Amy Ellen Schwartz Presented at the Annual Conference of the Association for Budgeting and Financial Management Washington, DC, November 9-13  Do schools that have been successful at reducing test score gaps between white students and students of color allocate resources differently than unsuccessful schools? This paper aims to answer that question, as there is little work at the school level correlating education expenditures to student outcomes. This analysis benefits from three features of expenditure data available in one New York State school district. The first is that these data are available at the school level, not the district level as is often the case. Second, not only overall levels of spending per pupil are available (i.e., total spending per pupil and total instructional spending per pupil), but also functional areas of spending disaggregated to such line items as professional development, classroom paraprofessionals, and principal compensation. Third, the spending data allow us to analyze expenditures on these line items not only for all students but also for two types of students: full-time special education and general education.

For academic years 1990-91 to 1994-95, the authors find adjusting for financial aid leads to a 22 percent decline in the estimated price index for all four-year colleges, while quality adjusting the results leads to a further, albeit smaller, decline. Nevertheless, public comprehensive colleges, perhaps an important gateway to college for students from low-income backrounds, experienced the largesg net price increases.

Weinstein, Thomas B. Saunders, Dorothy Siegel Institute for Education and Social Policy To allocate Title I funds to its schools, a school district first needs to determine individual student eligibility for Title I services through some measure of individual student poverty. After determining student eligibility, the district aggregates the number of eligible students in each school. To be eligible for Title I funds, schools must have at least the number of eligible students needed to pass a threshold. Schools that do not meet that threshold receive no Title I funds. Many districts, including the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE), currently use free lunch eligibility forms as an indicator of individual student poverty.An alternative method that has been proposed would use U.S. Census data and student residential and demographic data already collected by the district as the basis for determining a student&#39;s eligibility for Title I funds. This approach involves mapping home addresses for all public school students in New York City and matching these addresses to Census measures of poverty at the block group level. This paper reports the efforts of NYU&#39;s Institute for Education and Social Policy to develop such a Census-based approach. The authors conducted analyses using both median household income by race/ethnicity at the block group level and the ratio of income in 1999 to poverty level of families at the tract level.

Historically, researchers have studied interdistrict distributions, but given the large numbers of pupils and schools within many urban districts, it is important to learn about intradistrict distributions as well. The empirical work is built on a framework of horizontal, vertical, and equal opportunity equity. The results show that the horizontal equity distributions are more disparate than what would be expected relative to results of other studies, vertical equity is lacking, especially in elementary schools, and equality of opportunity is at best neutral but more often absent. Middle schools exhibit more equity than elementary schools. The paper is one of the first to measure output equity, using levels and changes in test scores to do so.

Work in Progress The Political Economy of Inequity in America&rsquo;s Public Schools Sean Corcoran and Howard Rosenthal, New York University, and Thomas Romer, Princeton University   An interdisciplinary research program on the politics and economics of school finance in the U.S., funded by the Spencer Foundation. In this project we will assemble a comprehensive panel database for the education finance systems of the 50 states and their school districts. We aim to collect and synthesize the institutional details of state finance systems over the 1970-2000 period (or at minimum, the years surrounding the four census years of 1970-1980-1990-2000), to combine with demographic, financial and political data on states and school districts. This panel&mdash;which would be the first of its kind to be made publicly available to the research community&mdash;will aid academic researchers, state policymakers, and school finance experts, analysts and litigants in better understanding the dynamics that produce within- and between-state disparities in school spending.

Weinstein, Thomas B. Saunders, Dorothy Siegel Institute for Education and Social Policy To allocate Title I funds to its schools, a school district first needs to determine individual student eligibility for Title I services through some measure of individual student poverty. After determining student eligibility, the district aggregates the number of eligible students in each school. To be eligible for Title I funds, schools must have at least the number of eligible students needed to pass a threshold. Schools that do not meet that threshold receive no Title I funds. Many districts, including the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE), currently use free lunch eligibility forms as an indicator of individual student poverty.An alternative method that has been proposed would use U.S. Census data and student residential and demographic data already collected by the district as the basis for determining a student&#39;s eligibility for Title I funds. This approach involves mapping home addresses for all public school students in New York City and matching these addresses to Census measures of poverty at the block group level. This paper reports the efforts of NYU&#39;s Institute for Education and Social Policy to develop such a Census-based approach. The authors conducted analyses using both median household income by race/ethnicity at the block group level and the ratio of income in 1999 to poverty level of families at the tract level.

Historically, researchers have studied interdistrict distributions, but given the large numbers of pupils and schools within many urban districts, it is important to learn about intradistrict distributions as well. The empirical work is built on a framework of horizontal, vertical, and equal opportunity equity. The results show that the horizontal equity distributions are more disparate than what would be expected relative to results of other studies, vertical equity is lacking, especially in elementary schools, and equality of opportunity is at best neutral but more often absent. Middle schools exhibit more equity than elementary schools. The paper is one of the first to measure output equity, using levels and changes in test scores to do so.

Work in Progress The Political Economy of Inequity in America&rsquo;s Public Schools Sean Corcoran and Howard Rosenthal, New York University, and Thomas Romer, Princeton University   An interdisciplinary research program on the politics and economics of school finance in the U.S., funded by the Spencer Foundation. In this project we will assemble a comprehensive panel database for the education finance systems of the 50 states and their school districts. We aim to collect and synthesize the institutional details of state finance systems over the 1970-2000 period (or at minimum, the years surrounding the four census years of 1970-1980-1990-2000), to combine with demographic, financial and political data on states and school districts. This panel&mdash;which would be the first of its kind to be made publicly available to the research community&mdash;will aid academic researchers, state policymakers, and school finance experts, analysts and litigants in better understanding the dynamics that produce within- and between-state disparities in school spending.

However, summer programs are a way to help students improve their academic skills in nonacademic settings,&rdquo; said Meryle Weinstein, research assistant professor of education policy at NYU&rsquo;s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the Institute for Education and Social Policy.    &ldquo;In our report on NFTE&rsquo;s summer entrepreneurship programs, many students indicated that the business-related skills they learned would help them in other parts of their lives, including academic areas such as writing and math, and even managing personal finances.&rdquo;    Weinstein will report her findings today in a panel titled &ldquo;New Ways to Measure Student Success&rdquo; at the annual meeting of the Association for Education Finance and Policy in Washington, D.C.    Teaching entrepreneurship &ndash; how to create, grow, and run a business or organization &ndash; is a potential way to increase college and career readiness skills. NFTE&rsquo;s 2014 summer programs, in which students learned basic business skills while developing an &ldquo;entrepreneurial mindset,&rdquo; served more than 450 at-risk teens in 10 cities across the country. Through classroom instruction, field trips to local businesses, guest speakers, working with mentors, and a business plan competition for seed funding, students worked to develop skills and knowledge essential for successful entrepreneurship.    Weinstein and her colleagues used both qualitative methods (interviews, observations, and focus groups) and surveys before and after the summer program to evaluate its implementation and benefit to students. The surveys were developed to measure business knowledge as well as &ldquo;entrepreneurial mindset,&rdquo; a collection of qualities and skills including communication and collaboration, initiative, persistence, self-direction, critical thinking, and problem solving. Key findings of the report include:       Approximately 95 percent of students agreed or strongly agreed that the skills they learned in the program would help them in their life and in business.    90 percent of students indicated that the skills they learned and experiences in the summer program would help them in school.    Students reported an improvement in their communication and problem solving skills as a result of the program.    Although students reported they were more prepared to start a business after completing the program, they were less likely to be interested in starting one. Prior to participating, 91 percent of students reported wanting to own a business, which declined slightly to 85 percent after.    Funding, youth, and lack of business skills were commonly cited as barriers to starting a business prior to the summer program. After the summer program, students perceived their skills, ideas, or resources as less of a problem, but were more likely to report that they were too busy to start a business. Many students worried about the competing time demands of starting a business and going to school.       In our research, almost all students remarked on the significant effort and time required to start and run a business, and often spoke about the important role of both persistence and passion,&rdquo; Weinstein said. &ldquo;Participating in the program may have served to clarify student career goals and interests.&rdquo;    The study was conducted by Weinstein, Megan Silander, and Michael Chavez-Reilly of NYU&rsquo;s Institute for Education and Social Policy, a joint initiative of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. The summer programs and NYU assessment were funded by a grant from the Citi Foundation as part of their Pathways to Progress initiative.    NYU Researchers Find New York City Summer Jobs Program Participation Leads to Improved School Attendance and Regents Scores    Reporting their initial findings, researchers at New York University&rsquo;s Institute for Education and Social Policy (IESP) have found that New York City&rsquo;s summer jobs program improved school attendance and other educational outcomes for youth participants.    In their policy brief entitled &ldquo;More than Paycheck? The Impact of Summer Youth Employment on Students Educational Engagement and Success,&rdquo; co-authors Jacob Leos-Urbel, Amy Ellen Schwartz,Meryle Weinstein, and Beth C. Weitzman explored school-related outcomes for New York City public school students who applied to the city&rsquo;s Summer Youth Employment Program in the summer of 2007. IESP is a joint institute of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, and the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.    The new analysis found that school attendance increased in the school year following the applicants&rsquo; participation in the summer job program. The greatest gains, it found, were among participants who had shown risk of educational failure, including those with less than 95 percent attendance before their summer job stint, as well as those age 16 and above who had greater degrees of autonomy with regard to their own school attendance decisions. In addition, for that group, the program increased the probability that they would pass the English and math Regents exams.    &ldquo;Although the Summer Youth Employment Program is focused primarily on work during the summer, these results suggest that benefits of the program carry over into the following school year,&rdquo; said NYU researcher Leos-Urbel.    New York City&rsquo;s Department of Youth and Community Development administers the summer jobs program. All New York City youth ages 14 to 24 are eligible to apply. Youth apply through community-based organizations, which serve as intake sites and supervise those placed in jobs. Participants work in entry-level posts in the nonprofit, private and public sectors, and are paid the minimum wage. Placements with summer camps and day care center are the most common.    Because the program is in high demand, the city uses a lottery system to determine which youth are offered a job. According to Leos-Urbel, &ldquo;While the city uses the SYEP lottery to be as fair as possible, it is also great from a research perspective, as it randomly assigns youth to the Summer Youth Employment Program, which represents the &lsquo;gold standard&rsquo; for program evaluation.&rdquo;    The researchers used Summer Youth Employment Program data for the summer 2007 program year, matched to NYC Department of Education files. The study sample included 36,630 applicants who were in grades 8-to-11 during the prior school year, of which 90 percent were eligible for free or reduced price lunch, and 85 percent were black or Hispanic. Future briefs by the researchers will examine additional years of data and look at the program&rsquo;s effect on other outcomes such as high school graduation and college enrollment.    The Institute for Education and Social Policy has received a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to research teacher preparation in earth science. It is part of a $2.8 million grant awarded to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH).    IESP Receives NSF Grant to Research Teacher Preparation in Earth Science    The Institute for Education and Social Policy has received a $500,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to research teacher preparation in earth science. It is part of a $2.8 million grant awarded to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH).    Under the grant, &ldquo;An Innovative Approach to Earth Science Teacher Preparation: Uniting Science, Informal Science Education, and Schools to Raise Student Achievement,&rdquo; AMNH will develop a new teacher education program model to prepare science teachers. NYU&rsquo;s Institute for Education and Social Policy (IESP) will then research whether students taught by teachers in the AMNH program outperform students taught by new earth science teachers trained in other programs.    The AMNH program, which will require residents-in-training to work alongside scientists, is one of several &ldquo;clinically rich&rdquo; pilot preparation programs, where theory and practice are woven and demonstrated in classroom instruction. The AMNH program will work with six middle-high schools in New York City, Yonkers, and Freeport, Long Island. Resident rotations will include science, English Language Learners (ELL), and Special Education classrooms. The program focuses on earth science because it is one of the greatest areas of teacher shortages in urban areas, a circumstance due, in part, to poor retention rates&mdash; an estimated 50 percent of new teachers in high-needs schools leave within the first five years.    AMNH, which has access to the required scientific and educational resources in earth science and related disciplines, including paleontology and astrophysics, will develop a program that will include two years of mentoring for new teachers. In addition, a full academic year of residency in high-needs public schools will be supplemented by: two AMNH-based clinical summer residencies, a museum teaching residency prior to entering their host schools, and a museum science residency prior to teaching candidates entering the profession.    NYU&rsquo;s IESP will then consider the effectiveness of the AMNH prepared teachers in comparison to other newly prepared teachers in New York State. The grant for the development and authorization of this new program comes from the New York State Education Department and the New York Board of Regents&rsquo; &ldquo;Race to the Top Fund.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Race to the Top Fund&rdquo; is designed to encourage and reward states that are creating the conditions for education innovation and reform in order to enhance student performance, raise and close achievement gaps, improve high school graduation rates, and bolster preparing for success in college and in the workplace.    The University of Southern Maine is the grant&rsquo;s external evaluator, which will review and assess the program as it is being implemented.    IESP receives new grant from the William T. Grant Foundation    The Institute for Education and Social Policy has been awarded 300,000 by the William T. Grant Foundation for the research project entitled \"Crime, Context, and Children's Academic Performance\". Children exposed to violent crime have poorer reading scores, higher rates of school absenteeism, lower educational attainment, higher dropout rates, and a lower likelihood of attending college. Prior research has also found that schools can buffer the negative psychological and behavioral effects of exposure to community violence. `The study will examine the impact of recent exposure to violent crime on academic achievement and how the impact varies with respect to the timing of the incident, its physical proximity to the student, and the degree of violence. The research team will be led by Amy Ellen Schwartz, Director of IESP, and Patrick Sharkey, Assisant Professof of Sociology, with investigators Ingrid Gould Ellen Professor of Urban Planning and Public Policy /Wagner, and Meryle Weinstein (Assistant Director of IESP).    IESP awarded $1.3 million from the National Institutes of Health     The Institute for Education and Social Policy has been awarded 1.3 million dollars from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the research project entitled \"The Impact of School Food Policy on Childhood Obesity\". Building on prior IESP work, this project will link FITNESSGRAM data collected by the New York City Department of Education and school characteristics to better understand the influence schools have on student health through their food policies. Specifically, the work will use econometric methods to investigate the role school and district food policies have on (a) BMI, (b) meal program participation, and (c) academic outcomes. Data on district policies, school practices, and neighborhood context will be collected via a city-wide survey of schools, interviews with district personnel, and several school case studies.    The research team, led by Principal Investigator Amy Ellen Schwartz, includes Brian Elbel (Assistant Professor of Medicine and Health Policy/NYU School of Medicine), Meryle Weinstein (Assistant Director of IESP), Sean P. Corcoran (Assistant Professor of Educational Economics/Steinhardt), L. Beth Dixon (Associate Professor of Nutrition and Public Health/Steinhardt), Leanna Stiefel (Professor of Economics/Wagner &amp; Steinhardt), and Rogan Kersh (Associate Professor of Public Policy/Wagner).    Public School Students Living in Foreclosed Buildings More Likely to Change Schools    New research findings from NYU&rsquo;s Furman Center and Institute for Education and Social Policy document the impact of the foreclosure crisis on student mobility    Building on their 2010 publication, Kids and Foreclosure: New York City , researchers at New York University&rsquo;s Institute for Education and Social Policy (IESP) and Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy have released a new study entitled, Foreclosure and Kids: Does Losing Your Home Mean Losing Your School? This report finds that public school students living in buildings in foreclosure were more likely to change schools in the year following a foreclosure notice than other students, and that they were less likely to enroll in schools outside New York City or to switch to private or parochial schools.    &ldquo;While we expected that children whose homes received a foreclosure notice would be more likely than other children to change schools, we were surprised that they are less likely to leave the New York City public school system.&rdquo; said Leanna Stiefel, associate director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible the foreclosure prevented families from moving or enrolling their children in parochial or private schools.&rdquo;    The research also finds that students who moved to new schools after a foreclosure tended to move to lower-performing schools. On average, children living in buildings entering foreclosure end up in schools with a math proficiency rate 12 percentage points lower and a reading proficiency rate five percentage points lower than the school they left. The change in school quality suffered by students who moved schools after foreclosure was no more dramatic, however, than changes experienced by other students who moved schools.    &ldquo;Students affected by foreclosure tend to wind up in poorer performing schools than those they left, which may affect their school performance in the future,&rdquo; said Vicki Been, faculty director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. &ldquo;The next step in our research will look specifically at how these foreclosure-related moves may affect student performance.&rdquo;    The report focuses on elementary and middle school students who attended New York City public schools in the 2003-04 and 2006-07 school years. Between those two time periods, the number of properties receiving a foreclosure notice increased by 41 percent, and the number of students living in properties entering foreclosure rose by 69 percent to 20,453 students.    The Open Society Foundations funded three research organizations from the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership (NNIP) to explore how foreclosures have affected children in their cities. NYU&rsquo;s Institute for Education and Social Policy and Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy were chosen to study New York City&rsquo;s public school students, while other researchers are examining children&rsquo;s experiences in Baltimore, MD, and Washington, DC.       The Effects of Housing Instability on Children's Educational Outcomes    The Institute for Education and Social Policy and the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy have been awarded a grant by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to study the effects of housing instability on children's educational outcomes in partnership with the University of Connecticut, Indiana University and Northwestern University.    The enormous upheavals in the housing arrangements of many American families over the last decade has exposed millions of children to housing instability, yet policymakers know surprising little about how these changes affect children. Past research has been limited by concerns that the impacts attributed to moving schools and homes could not be separated from the impacts of unobserved characteristics of the families that move and of the neighborhoods to which they move.    Using longitudinal data linking foreclosures and other kinds of housing upheavals to individual public school student records in four major markets suffering from unusual housing instability-New York City, and the counties of San Diego and Fresno in California and Pinellas County in Florida -we will test whether and how housing instability affects students' educational outcomes. Because current housing instability often is attributable to changes and volatility in mortgage and housing markets rather than to changes in a family's own characteristics, we are able to use a variety of empirical strategies to separate the effects of housing instability from the effects of unobserved family characteristics. Our primary strategy will be to compare the educational outcomes of students who have experienced housing instability to those of otherwise similar students who have not experienced such instability, before and after the instability.    Our findings will inform federal, state and local housing, mortgage finance and education policymakers about whether, when, and how they should intervene in housing markets or tailor educational processes to try to reduce any negative effects that housing instability may cause. Further, the findings will help policymakers at every level of government better estimate the benefits of providing more stable housing.Research Partners:    Vicki Been, NYU Law, Furman Center    Ingrid Gould Ellen, NYU Wagner School of Public Service, Furman Center    Amy Ellen Schwartz, NYU Steinhardt, NYU Institute for Education and Social Policy    Leanna Stiefel, NYU Steinhardt, NYU Institute for Education and Social Policy    Stephen Ross, Department of Economics, University of Connecticut    David Figlio, Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University    Ashlyn Aiko Nelson, School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University    To read the official press release from the MacArthur Foundation click here .
