Fellows work closely with attending physicians, orthopaedic surgery residents, statisticians and other research staff in the hospital, clinic, and lab setting. The program works to develop and shape the fellow\u2019s ability to develop a hypothesis, conduct a review of the literature, and develop a protocol for execution of research projects. Fellows work in conjunction with attending physician mentors to submit the developed protocols to the Institutional Review Board for review and ultimately have the opportunity to follow their projects to fruition once approved.   As part of the clinical research data collection experience, fellows develop skills in patient interaction, learn and improve upon physical exam maneuvers, and observe trauma surgeries. Upon completion of data collection, fellows are given the opportunity to organize, analyze, and prepare the data for submission to academic journals for publication and presentation to peers. They are also encouraged to take advantage of courses offered through NYU School of Medicine to further develop their ability to manipulate and organize data.   Postgraduate and medical students participating in this program have the opportunity to accompany the orthopaedic surgery team during morning rounds, listen to experts speak about current research during weekly Grand Rounds, and have the opportunity to become an important member of the research community. The fellowship ultimately establishes a strong understanding of not only clinical research but the complex nature of patient care. Interested individuals should contact Kenneth Egol MD, Director of Trauma Research at kenneth.egol@nyumc.org                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]},
