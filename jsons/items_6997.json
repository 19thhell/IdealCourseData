This course looks at the various elements that make up and structure the contemporary urban subject in Asia. This includes architecture, art, technology and new media, and economic (and political economic) conditions. Attention is paid to the ways in which each of these factors create and organize life\u2014but the aim is also to examine how these elements are being recombined in ways that point to new orders of social life in general. The boundaries of crime, and of subculture, play an integral role in this view. While sociological analysis is part of the approach, the course also draws heavily on the ways in which conditions are formulated and expressed in fiction, film, animation, and fine art. The course entails some historical overview and comparison with earlier moments (especially the early 20th century), but the emphasis is on the situation now. It is also meant to provide a comparative view between major Asian cities, but will focus on particular cities (depending on the instructor, and when the course is offered). The conditions being discussed are also global, and so inevitably the topics expand beyond Asia as well, even while they have specificity in different regions. At stake overall is the changing conditions of life, of mass culture, and of the social community in Asia and the world. Historical Epics of China and Japan EAST-GA 1726 Roberts. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. An in-depth study of the major epics of China, Japan, and Vietnam, from the historical-military and the social-romantic. The Chinese historical epic Three Kingdoms is read against the Japanese epic Tale of the Heike. Emphasis is placed on the political nature of the dynastic state form, the types of legitimacy and the forms of rebellion, the process of breakdown and reintegration of an imperial house, the empire as dynasty and as territory, and the range of characterology. In the second half of the course, the Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber is read against the Japanese The Tale of Genji. In addition to the above-mentioned topics, attention is given to the role of women and marriage in a governing elite, the modalities of social criticism in a novel of manners. The Vietnamese national classic Tale of Kieu is used as an introduction to the course because it combines all of the key topics. Particular attention is given to the ways in which Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian doctrines function in each work. First-Year Seminar: Introduction to Critical Asian Studies EAST-GA 1001 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course is an introductory seminar offered to first-year graduate students in East Asian studies. The seminar provides a critical overview of the social, political, intellectual, and institutional history of the field of East Asian studies. Chinese Philosophy in Chinese EAST-GA 1223 Roberts. 4 points. 2014-15. Translation, Modernity, and History EAST-GA 1761 Karl. 4 points. 2013-14. Problems in the History of Early Modern China EAST-GA 1919 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The Asiatic Mode of Production: Theory and History EAST-GA 2530 Karl. 4 points. 2014-15. Investigates aspects of the historical interpretation of China in the 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on the genesis and development of one of the most debated and enduring tropes of the historiography of China: the Asiatic mode of production. Structures of Modernity EAST-GA 2700 Looser. 4 points. 2014-15. This course starts with\u2014and aims to rethink\u2014the basic theoretical terms and practical conditions of mass culture and everyday life as definitive of modernity. In part, the course is framed by claims made in new media theory (especially with regard to the advent of digital electronic technologies) and the ways in which new media supposedly are placing us within new world horizons. Modernity, however, is made up of multiple moments of \"new media\"; this course provides historical perspective on these moments. Nor does the course assume a technological determinism; in addition to changing relations between \"new\" media (including theatre, film, and animation), it examines the changing structuring of experience in terms of narrative form; architecture; art; and urbanism. One of the unifying concerns, however, is history itself and the ways in which differing material conditions create new visions of, and positions within, history. History, therefore, is one of the means through which new media conditions claim to allow the rethinking of, and critique of, the grounds of modern experience. Emphasis is placed on Japan, but comparative material is drawn from elsewhere in Asia and the West; the context is for the most part global.

An in-depth study of the major epics of China, Japan, and Vietnam, from the historical-military and the social-romantic. The Chinese historical epic Three Kingdoms is read against the Japanese epic Tale of the Heike.

In this seven-week course we will read and compare two English translations of the text, by Seidensticker and Tyler. Each week we will supplement our readings with selected secondary sources to focus our attention on such topics as: narration, visuality, sexual politics, relation to reality, poetics, and aesthetics in the text.
