Description       How was the concept of environmental sustainability born? How did the idea of sustainability transform into the goal of sustainable development? Is innovation helping or hindering achieving the aims of sustainable development? These are some of the questions we address in this course. While working to define sustainability within various contexts, students explore how the complexity of a particular system can complicate the task of sustaining it. Building off of a diverse set of texts, we examine the concept of sustainability from many different perspectives including agriculture, economic development, health care, international law, urban planning, engineering, and religion. Readings may include texts by Henry David Thoreau, Richard Muller, Elinor Ostrom, John Young, Ann Thorpe, Richard Norgaard, Sharachchandra L\u00e9l\u00e9, David Pearce, Janis Birkeland, and David MacKay. Students write several critical essays throughout the semester culminating in a final research paper.

Below is the complete course list for the social impact and innovation specialization. Additionally, there are five career tracks within the specialization that represent the scope of industry and function available to those seeking a career in social impact.

Description       How was the concept of environmental sustainability born? How did the idea of sustainability transform into the goal of sustainable development? Is innovation helping or hindering achieving the aims of sustainable development? These are some of the questions we address in this course. While working to define sustainability within various contexts, students explore how the complexity of a particular system can complicate the task of sustaining it. Building off of a diverse set of texts, we examine the concept of sustainability from many different perspectives including agriculture, economic development, health care, international law, urban planning, engineering, and religion. Readings may include texts by Henry David Thoreau, Richard Muller, Elinor Ostrom, John Young, Ann Thorpe, Richard Norgaard, Sharachchandra L\u00e9l\u00e9, David Pearce, Janis Birkeland, and David MacKay. Students write several critical essays throughout the semester culminating in a final research paper.
