Originally founded by Detroit newspaper owners, George and Ellen Booth in 1914, it has grown to a 315 acre campus that includes an Art Musuem, Institute of Science, graduate Art Academy, and lower, middle, and upper private schools. In addition, it is home to the Cranbrook House, a model of Arts and Crafts movement architecture and design; the Saarinen house, designed by the memers of the Saarinen house who specialized in architecture and interior design; an Episcopalian cathedral decorated with Arts and Crafts movement artifacts, and an extensive formal garden. The entire campus reflects both the Booth's special support of the Arts and Crafts movement and Cranbrook's continuing philosophy that art should be integrated into every aspect of life.    Description of Collection      The Archive is housed in its own separate building on the Cranbrook campus. This building is currently taxed for space for the storage of all the archival materials. It contains about 250,000 photos and negatives and 6,500 Architectural drawings and sketches, as well as textual archival materials.     The photos, mostly of places, people, and events associated with Cranbrook are now housed in file cabinets and albums. The negatives are regarded as the primary     archival collection, and the archive's emphasis is on preserving them. The pictures are a browsing collection and are considered expendable, since prints can be made from the negatives, albeit for a price. The negatives are kept in acid-free envelopes, and are labelled with a number, and description. Currently only some of the negatives are in the acid free envelopes: as the negatives are  pulled for use, they are transferred to the envelopes. Money is not available for the staff hours to transfer the entire collection. The photos, in folders in filing cabinets, are organized by subject; frequently by the institution/school represented in them; they are not cataloged at the item or collection level.      The Architectural drawings are stored in large flat folders in cabinet drawers. They are cataloged to the item level in MARC format, but the cataloging system has no image capacity.      The Museum has prints, paintings, and photos. These are mostly works  of teachers and students at Cranbrook, covering a variety of subject matter. There are also many prints, photos, and paintings from all periods, scattered over the Cranbrook campus. The Musuem is in charge of cataloguing and monitoring these items.

They are still working out the bugs in Horizon, and they recognize they have an authority control problem (when they typed in a test name for us as a sample search, six variations on the name came up as main entry). Horizon is based on a client/server model with check out and cataloging done in the system; it is a Windows based application, in which multiple windows can be opened at once (as opposed to text-based NOTIS-like systems)    SNAP   The SNAP system, a Willoughby product, is used by the Cranbrook Museum.

As a first step, Cranbrook is in the process of writing a grant proposal to take 35mm slides of the Architectural drawings, scan these negatives, and then create a PhotoCD collection. They would also like to do an SGML markup of finding aids, and make these aides available on the Web, as well as making part of the image collection publicly available on the Web. Currently, they have not digitized any of the collection. Digitizing the archive will require a great deal of storage space, and Cranbrook's administration has been hesitant to grant the necessary space. Cranbrook has just recently hired a new information technology director, and they hope to resolve this issue, as well as have full internet access by the end of the year. Their internal network infrastructure is very powerful, but currently they only have email connections to the outside world.      The Cranbrook Archivists feel that all of Cranbrook's collections are under-used and under-recognized and would like to promote these collections much more extensively. They are eager to work with SILS students who have creative ideas for multimedia projects that would take advantage of and highlight Cranbrook's resources. Bill Landis, a former SILS student and current Cranbrook Archivist, is now putting together an electronic exhibition of a few of Cranbrook's photos; this will be mounted in the SILS Internet Public Library Exhibit Hall shortly."}]},

The classes follow a seasonal theme and a curriculum that is based on sensory input. Your child will be immersed in fun activities, while learning to identify new and familiar sounds and objects. Interactions and activities include greetings, songs, nursery rhymes, movement, stories, and crafts.  In the Toddler Class (age 3-4) children interact with the language by playing games, making crafts, singing songs, and storytelling. These activities supplement our standard German kindergarten activities especially learning the concepts of same and different, size, opposites, left and right, numbers, colors and more. Seasonal topics are also incorporated into the lesson plan. The Primary Class is for children 5-6. We learn and practice German through playful activities that encourage the kids to communicate in German. The curriculum is filled with activities that encourage language and literacy development in young children, e.g. rhythmic games, playing with syllables and letters. Reading and writing is introduced through games and other supplemental learning materials. The Lower Elementary Class is for children 7-8. We focus on conversation to expand vocabulary and work on Grammar, as well as reading and writing in German. Reading and writing is introduced within the learning topic. Other supplemental learning materials are supporting the reading and writing development as well. The Elementary Class is for children ages 9-10. The focus of this course in conversation, but a strong literacy component ensures that the students not only listen, speak and play in German, but read and write, as well as work on grammar. The topics are chosen according to children's interests to provide a fun yet educational environment similar to schools in Germany. The Upper Elementary Class is for children ages 11-12. The course is for students who are already communicating well, but need to work on grammar and orthography.
