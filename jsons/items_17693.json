How to Choose an Hu/SS Elective   Please click here to learn more about choosing an Hu/SS Elective, and for a list of Hu/SS Electives for Fall 2015.   The Cluster Concept   TCS offers elective courses that fulfill Poly&rsquo;s undergraduate requirement for courses in humanities and social sciences&mdash;part of the undergraduate core curriculum. These courses explore the relations among science, technology, and society from three general approaches and modes of inquiry: Culture, Arts and Media (CAM); Science, Technology and Society (STS); and Society, Environment and Globalization (SEG). This integrated approach to science, technology, and the humanities and social sciences provides engineering and science majors with a concrete and focused foundation for their fields.   On this page, you can find information about:     Overview of the clusters   The School of Engineering humanities and social science requirement   Culture, Arts and Media electives   Science, Technology and Society electives   Society, Environment and Globalization electives   NYU approved courses     Cluster Overview   Culture, Arts and Media (CAM)   The CAM cluster explores how cultural practices and artifacts in a wide range of media reflect, influence, and interact with developments in science and technology. Courses are based on philosophy, media studies, music, literary studies, art history, rhetoric, and anthropology. The media studies courses are required for students who major in Integrated Digital Media.   Science, Technology and Society (STS)   STS cluster courses explore the interrelationships among science, technology, culture, and society. STS unites and investigates a myriad of disciplines, including history, philosophy, rhetoric, literary studies, and sociology. The questions posed are: How do science and technology shape society? How do social processes frame scientific and technological enterprises? What is the relationship between the content of scientific and technological knowledge and the social and intellectual context in which it is created? Courses from this cluster are also electives for STS majors and are used to fulfill the 24 credits of &quot;restricted&quot; electives for the major.   Society, Environment and Globalization (SEG)   Courses in the SEG cluster address the way the critical areas of society, environment, and globalization are interlinked and how they affect the experience of modern life. Coming from the complementary perspectives of the humanities and social sciences, SEG courses provide students with a broad and multicultural perspective on how environmental issues and global exchange in this &ldquo;flat world&rdquo; are changing society, here and across the world. Many courses in this cluster are also generally &ldquo;concentration&rdquo; courses for SUE majors.   Required Courses for Fulfilling the School of Engineering Humanities and Social Sciences Core Requirement (24 credits)   All students at the School of Engineering must complete a minimum of 24 credits in humanities and social science courses. Some majors have additional requirements beyond those listed here.   Preparatory Course (8 credits)   This course is offered to students who need help getting ready for college-level writing and reading courses. They do not count toward the requirements for graduation.   1. First-Year Writing Requirement (2 Courses, 8 credits)   Fall Semester: EXPOS-UA 1   Spring semester: EXPOS-UA 2   Note: These courses are offered by the NYU Expository Writing Program. For more information, please visit the Expository Writing Program .   1b. Before Fall 2012   For information regarding First- Year Writing Requirments prior to Fall 2012, please contact the TCS Department at TCS@nyu.edu   2. Humanities and Social Science Elective Requirement (4 courses, 16 credits)   Students may choose 4 humanities or social science courses from any TCS cluster. These 4 electives can be within a single cluster or across multiple clusters. For optimal breadth of experience, TCS encourages students to take electives across clusters and/or across disciplines within a cluster. These 4 humanities and social science electives must satisfy the following constraints:     At least 1 must be a 3xxx/4xxx level humanities or social science elective; and   At least 1 must be a writing-intensive elective, labeled by &ldquo;W&rdquo; in the course listings the semester it is offered.   The same course, or two different courses may be used to fulfill the writing-intensive requirement and the 3xxx/4xxx requirement.     TCS Elective Offerings   The following courses are offered by the department on a regular basis. However, not every courses is offered in a particular semester.   Special Note About Course Descriptions : If a course number doesn&#39;t link to the course description, you can find the full description on pages 91 to 100 of the School of Engineering academic catalog .   Prior to Fall 2014, these requirements were based on 3-credit courses. For more information regarding the 3-credit courses versus 4-credit courses that are now given, please contact the TCS Department at TCS@nyu.edu .   Cluster 1: Culture, Arts and Media (CAM)    Courses in the CAM cluster explore how cultural practices and artifacts in a wide range of media reflect, influence and interact with developments in science and technology.
