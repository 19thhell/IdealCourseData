Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Moloney (Music)  s yllabus Drawing from selected studies and recordings of music in a variety of world cultures and a semester-long series of live in-class performances by, and interviews with, some of the world's greatest musicians, we examine the complex roles that music plays in day-to-day life. We explore the ways in which music is learned, composed, performed, admired, critiqued, used, and consumed, and look at the multi-faceted relationships between music and music making and race, gender, sexual preference, class, and regional and national identities. Close attention is paid to the ways in which different kinds of music can function as crucial identity markers, particularly in times of great social change and population movements. We consider the ways we 'hear' music in multiple social situations, such as individual and community rituals, and performance events, such as concerts and festivals, and we also look at how music is 'used' in media forms such as film and television and, more generally, as a commodity in the world market place. We study the increasingly complex ways all of us 'consume' or enjoy music in multiple modalities, from street music to radio, CD players and iPods, and downloading from internet sites. In our journey we familiarize ourselves with and interrogate terms like 'musicality', 'musical literacy', 'musical language', 'orality', 'aurality', and various other analytical and descriptive constructs that have been used in discussions on music and society. Most of all, we try to learn not to take music for granted but to be mindful, appreciative, and questioning of the various ways it touches, and can enrich, our lives. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Oliver (Music)  s yllabus  Think about your favorite music, musician, song, and then think about the technologies that make them and your listening possible: microphones, recording studios, CDs, mp3 files, musical instruments, speakers, iPods, etc. Are these technologies essential to this music? Are they circumstantial? Some musical practices seem, at least at first sight, non-technological; others are overtly technological and use screens, speakers, computers, and other gadgets, as central aspects of their music. Focusing on experimental electronic and computer music and a diverse range of popular music produced in the 20th and 21st Century, we ask: What is music? What is sound? What is noise? What is music technology? Is music inherently technological? Is technology expressive? FALL 2014 CORE-UA 740, Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics &amp; the Aquila Theatre)  syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary America--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus We screen, read and discuss a range of utopian/dystopian visions of the future as forecast in our popular cinema, and literature. Our screenings explore a range of films from from \u2018sci fi\u2019 to fantasy and horror, extending from the 1950s to the present, and far into the future. We explore varied questions and issues including the increasing prevalence of apocalyptic endings to present and future worlds; contrasts between a fragile democratic \u2018now\u2019 vs. an authoritarian techno-future; race, gender, and sexuality in the \u2018scientifically\u2019 engineered and overdetermined future; class, labor and social privilege among replicants, cyborgs, and humans; the consumption of virtual reality, cyber-sex, and other commodities; post-technological tribalism; future \u2018hoods and cityscapes; warnings of cyber-surveillance, techno-collapse, and eco-disaster. And finally, we ask: what is \u2018utopia,\u2019 how is it \u2018imagined,\u2019 and is it still possible? We develop our seminar discussions, screenings and papers with readings from the likes of George Orwell, Ray Kurzweil, Paul Vrilio, and Aldous Huxley, among others. Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Soucek (Institute of Fine Arts)  syllabus  Indian Court Painting: 1450-1800. Before the twentieth century, the cultural and artistic life of the Indian subcontinent was primarily supported by rulers in various regional centers. During the period, paintings on paper filled several important roles. They fused the indigenous tradition of devotional imagery with new, primarily secular functions. In the Indian cultural tradition paintings provide visual metaphors for various moods, seasons, times of day and concepts. They celebrate the lives and accomplishments of individual rulers through the medium of narrative pictures and portraits. They also recall the lives and personalities of gods and heroes. The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds an important collection of Indian paintings and during the spring of 2015 is hosting a major loan exhibition devoted to Indian art, creating a unique opportunity for students to encounter these works. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Silver (Art History)  syllabus Avant-Garde New York, from the Armory Show to Andy Warhol. New York became the center of avant-garde art-making in the period just after the Second World War, although the city had been preparing for its modernist ascendancy since the early years of the 20th century. We focus on art and its makers--native New Yorkers and out-of-towners, Americans and foreign-born practitioners--who helped shape and refine New York\u2019s extraordinarily rich avant-garde \u201ctradition.\u201d Painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, graphic artists, and set designers will be studied, including Alfred Stieglitz, Raymond Hood, Charles Demuth, Paul Manship, Piet Mondrian, Joseph Cornell, Helen Levitt, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Philip Johnson, and Andy Warhol, as will the context in which their work came into being and flourished--museums, galleries, art schools, patrons, artist neighborhoods, professional organizations, ad hoc associations, and artist \u201changouts.\u201d Topics include: the Stieglitz Circle and 291; The Armory Show (1913); the Paris/New York connection; the founding of the Museum of Modern Art; Marcel Duchamp and New York Dada; the art of the Harlem Renaissance; Frank O\u2019Hara--poet, critic, curator; Street Photography; the birth of Abstract Expressionism; Avant-gardism in Washington Square--Judson Dance Theater; From Madison Avenue to 57th Street--Pop Art Emerges. Includes class excursions to museums, galleries, and other New York art sites. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 721, Expressive Culture: Painting &amp; Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History)  syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Dang (Music)  syllabus The art of listening through close study of musical performances from a wide range of cultures and places, from Kaluli song to Corsican polyphony, from Cuban rumba to Aboriginal rock. We explore the sensory details of musical sounds, the cultural and historical encounters informing those sounds, and their contemporary circulation in the global marketplace. Through our varied musical excursions, we raise questions about homelands, heritage, and belonging; about the diverse genres of music-making, from mimicry of nature to multi-track remixes, song, dance, and drumming; about music\u2019s role in articulating the individual\u2019s relationship to society, the environment, and the metaphysical world; about language, authenticity, and hybridity; and finally, about the complicated politics of global exchange that influence musical production and consumption. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus   Explores the unsettling ability of science fiction and horror movies, or combinations thereof, to depict society\u2019s range of repressed, charged and subversive issues. Many of these films represent a variety of socially constructed identities and differences in their nightmare narratives, monsters and fantastic settings. Covering a roughly historical trajectory of popular horror and sci-fi flicks, we ponder how they engage difference in various social expressions from race, childhood, gender, to ideology, class, and imagined, confabulated representations of the body, including \u2018the post-human condition.\u2019 Readings draw on a number of relevant critical insights and discourses, from psychoanalysis to cultural and class analysis, queer theory, futureology and beyond. Films include Picture of Dorian Gray, Gattica, The Hunger, J.D.\u2019s Revenge, Children of the Corn, Solaris, Forbidden Planet. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 762, Expressive Culture: Viva Verdi Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus  The rich artistic life of Italy between the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 and the consolidation of the fascists in power in the 1920\u2019s. Italy was above all the home of opera, and we explore both the economic side of the \u201copera industry\u201d and the most important works of the peninsula\u2019s greatest composers of the day: Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Puccini, and above all Giuseppe Verdi, the most dominant artistic figure in 19th century Italy. We follow Verdi\u2019s stylistic development from the \u201cgalley years\u201d of the 1840\u2019s through the late masterpieces as well as examine the impact of Italian politics on his operas. We also read works of literature by Stendhal, di Lampedusa, Svevo, and Pirandello, and conclude with Martinetti, Boccioni, and the futurist movement in the visual arts and the relationship of these and other artists to fascism.

We consider the ways we 'hear' music in multiple social situations, such as individual and community rituals, and performance events, such as concerts and festivals, and we also look at how music is 'used' in media forms such as film and television and, more generally, as a commodity in the world market place. We study the increasingly complex ways all of us 'consume' or enjoy music in multiple modalities, from street music to radio, CD players and iPods, and downloading from internet sites. In our journey we familiarize ourselves with and interrogate terms like 'musicality', 'musical literacy', 'musical language', 'orality', 'aurality', and various other analytical and descriptive constructs that have been used in discussions on music and society. Most of all, we try to learn not to take music for granted but to be mindful, appreciative, and questioning of the various ways it touches, and can enrich, our lives. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Oliver (Music)  s yllabus  Think about your favorite music, musician, song, and then think about the technologies that make them and your listening possible: microphones, recording studios, CDs, mp3 files, musical instruments, speakers, iPods, etc. Are these technologies essential to this music? Are they circumstantial? Some musical practices seem, at least at first sight, non-technological; others are overtly technological and use screens, speakers, computers, and other gadgets, as central aspects of their music. Focusing on experimental electronic and computer music and a diverse range of popular music produced in the 20th and 21st Century, we ask: What is music? What is sound? What is noise? What is music technology? Is music inherently technological? Is technology expressive? FALL 2014 CORE-UA 740, Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics &amp; the Aquila Theatre)  syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary America--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus We screen, read and discuss a range of utopian/dystopian visions of the future as forecast in our popular cinema, and literature. Our screenings explore a range of films from from \u2018sci fi\u2019 to fantasy and horror, extending from the 1950s to the present, and far into the future. We explore varied questions and issues including the increasing prevalence of apocalyptic endings to present and future worlds; contrasts between a fragile democratic \u2018now\u2019 vs. an authoritarian techno-future; race, gender, and sexuality in the \u2018scientifically\u2019 engineered and overdetermined future; class, labor and social privilege among replicants, cyborgs, and humans; the consumption of virtual reality, cyber-sex, and other commodities; post-technological tribalism; future \u2018hoods and cityscapes; warnings of cyber-surveillance, techno-collapse, and eco-disaster. And finally, we ask: what is \u2018utopia,\u2019 how is it \u2018imagined,\u2019 and is it still possible? We develop our seminar discussions, screenings and papers with readings from the likes of George Orwell, Ray Kurzweil, Paul Vrilio, and Aldous Huxley, among others. Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Soucek (Institute of Fine Arts)  syllabus  Indian Court Painting: 1450-1800. Before the twentieth century, the cultural and artistic life of the Indian subcontinent was primarily supported by rulers in various regional centers. During the period, paintings on paper filled several important roles. They fused the indigenous tradition of devotional imagery with new, primarily secular functions. In the Indian cultural tradition paintings provide visual metaphors for various moods, seasons, times of day and concepts. They celebrate the lives and accomplishments of individual rulers through the medium of narrative pictures and portraits. They also recall the lives and personalities of gods and heroes. The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds an important collection of Indian paintings and during the spring of 2015 is hosting a major loan exhibition devoted to Indian art, creating a unique opportunity for students to encounter these works. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Silver (Art History)  syllabus Avant-Garde New York, from the Armory Show to Andy Warhol. New York became the center of avant-garde art-making in the period just after the Second World War, although the city had been preparing for its modernist ascendancy since the early years of the 20th century. We focus on art and its makers--native New Yorkers and out-of-towners, Americans and foreign-born practitioners--who helped shape and refine New York\u2019s extraordinarily rich avant-garde \u201ctradition.\u201d Painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, graphic artists, and set designers will be studied, including Alfred Stieglitz, Raymond Hood, Charles Demuth, Paul Manship, Piet Mondrian, Joseph Cornell, Helen Levitt, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Philip Johnson, and Andy Warhol, as will the context in which their work came into being and flourished--museums, galleries, art schools, patrons, artist neighborhoods, professional organizations, ad hoc associations, and artist \u201changouts.\u201d Topics include: the Stieglitz Circle and 291; The Armory Show (1913); the Paris/New York connection; the founding of the Museum of Modern Art; Marcel Duchamp and New York Dada; the art of the Harlem Renaissance; Frank O\u2019Hara--poet, critic, curator; Street Photography; the birth of Abstract Expressionism; Avant-gardism in Washington Square--Judson Dance Theater; From Madison Avenue to 57th Street--Pop Art Emerges. Includes class excursions to museums, galleries, and other New York art sites. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 721, Expressive Culture: Painting &amp; Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History)  syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Dang (Music)  syllabus The art of listening through close study of musical performances from a wide range of cultures and places, from Kaluli song to Corsican polyphony, from Cuban rumba to Aboriginal rock. We explore the sensory details of musical sounds, the cultural and historical encounters informing those sounds, and their contemporary circulation in the global marketplace. Through our varied musical excursions, we raise questions about homelands, heritage, and belonging; about the diverse genres of music-making, from mimicry of nature to multi-track remixes, song, dance, and drumming; about music\u2019s role in articulating the individual\u2019s relationship to society, the environment, and the metaphysical world; about language, authenticity, and hybridity; and finally, about the complicated politics of global exchange that influence musical production and consumption. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus   Explores the unsettling ability of science fiction and horror movies, or combinations thereof, to depict society\u2019s range of repressed, charged and subversive issues. Many of these films represent a variety of socially constructed identities and differences in their nightmare narratives, monsters and fantastic settings. Covering a roughly historical trajectory of popular horror and sci-fi flicks, we ponder how they engage difference in various social expressions from race, childhood, gender, to ideology, class, and imagined, confabulated representations of the body, including \u2018the post-human condition.\u2019 Readings draw on a number of relevant critical insights and discourses, from psychoanalysis to cultural and class analysis, queer theory, futureology and beyond. Films include Picture of Dorian Gray, Gattica, The Hunger, J.D.\u2019s Revenge, Children of the Corn, Solaris, Forbidden Planet. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 762, Expressive Culture: Viva Verdi Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus  The rich artistic life of Italy between the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 and the consolidation of the fascists in power in the 1920\u2019s. Italy was above all the home of opera, and we explore both the economic side of the \u201copera industry\u201d and the most important works of the peninsula\u2019s greatest composers of the day: Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Puccini, and above all Giuseppe Verdi, the most dominant artistic figure in 19th century Italy. We follow Verdi\u2019s stylistic development from the \u201cgalley years\u201d of the 1840\u2019s through the late masterpieces as well as examine the impact of Italian politics on his operas. We also read works of literature by Stendhal, di Lampedusa, Svevo, and Pirandello, and conclude with Martinetti, Boccioni, and the futurist movement in the visual arts and the relationship of these and other artists to fascism.

Certificate Program in Culture and Media     The Departments of Anthropology and Cinema Studies offer a specialized joint course of study leading to a New York State Certificate in Culture and Media for NYU graduate students who are also pursuing their PhD degrees in Anthropology or Cinema Studies. The program\u2019s philosophy takes a broad approach to the relationships   between culture and media in a number of domains including: ethnographic   film\u2019s significance for the fields of anthropology and cinema/media   studies; problems in representation of cultures through media; the   development of media in indigenous, Diaspora, and non-Western   communities; the emerging social and cultural formations shaped by new   media practices; the political economy shaping the production,   distribution and consumption of media worldwide; and the impact of new   media technologies on these processes.   This graduate program provides a focused course of studies   integrating production with theory and research. Training in this   program will enable students to pursue the following:   -Production work in state-of-the-art digital video based on their   own research, resulting in a twenty-thirty minute documentary. Student   works have shown in festivals worldwide, won multiple awards, and are in   distribution.  For a list of recent student documentaries click here .      -Ethnographic research into the social practice of media in a range of   communities and cultures. Students from the program have done PhD   research on the development of media in diverse settings, from the   emergence of film and TV in Papua New Guinea, to circulation of   religious media in Northern Nigeria.    -Teaching the history, theory, and production of ethnographic documentary and related issues.    -A career in media requiring an understanding of anthropology, such as   specialized programming and distribution of ethnographic film and   video, community-based documentary production, management of   ethnographic film/video libraries and archives, or work in new media.  Each year, two student works are selected for a pitch session at the prestigious SILVERDOCS documentary festival. http://silverdocs.com/ .

[7]/[8] ANTH GA 1218-19 &amp; ANTH GA 1218-19    VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail) 8 PTS   (Prerequisite: Sight and Sound Documentary or equivalent)         COURSE DESCRIPTIONS (REQUIRED)    CULTURE &amp; MEDIA I (Ganti/Ginsburg)    This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. Ethnographic film has a peculiar and highly contested status within anthropology, cinema studies, and documentary practice. In this seminar, we will situate ethnographic film within the wider project of the representation of cultural lives, and especially \"natives\". Starting with what are regarded as the first examples of the genre, we will examine how these emerged in a particular intellectual context and political economy. We will then consider the key works that have defined the genre, and the epistemological and formal innovations associated with them, addressing questions concerning social theory, documentary, as well as the institutional structures through which they are funded, distributed, and seen by various audiences. Throughout the course we will keep in mind the properties of film as a signifying practice, its status as a form of anthropological knowledge, and the ethical and political concerns raised by cross-cultural representation.   CULTURE &amp; MEDIA II: ETHNOGRAPHY OF MEDIA (Ginsburg/Ganti)    In the last decade, a new field \u2014 the ethnography of media \u2014 has emerged as an exciting new arena of research. While claims about media in peoples lives are made on a daily basis, surprisingly little research has actually attempted to look at how media is part of the naturally occurring lived realities of people\u2019s lives. In the last decade, anthropologists and media scholars interested in film, television, and video have been turning their attention increasingly beyond the text and empiricist notions of audiences, (stereotypically associated with the ethnography of media), to consider, ethnographically, the complex social worlds in which media is produced, circulated and consumed, at home and elsewhere. This work theorizes media studies from the point of view of cross-cultural ethnographic realities and anthropology from the perspective of new spaces of communication focusing on the social, economic and political life of media and how it makes a difference in the daily lives of people as a practice, whether in production, reception, or circulation.    The class will be organized around case studies that interrogate broader issues that are particularly endemic to questions of cross-cultural media including debates over cultural imperialism vs. the autonomy of local producers/consumers, the instability and stratification of reception, the shift from national to transnational circuits of production and consumption, the increasing complicity of researchers with their subjects over representations of culture, and the historically and culturally contingent ways in which images are read and used. These concerns are addressed in a variety of locations, from the complex circulation of films, photos, and lithographs, to the ever increasing range of televisual culture \u2014 from state sponsored melodramas, religious epics and soap operas, to varieties of public television; to the activist use of video, radio, the internet, and small media.    CULTURAL THEORY AND THE DOCUMENTARY (Toby Lee)    This course considers the actual and possible forms of relation between theories of culture and society and the mode of nonfiction cinema known as (social) documentary. From one perspective, theory is a discourse of explanation that is applied, concurrently or retroactively, to the images of culture presented in documentary films: films present raw material of culture to be theorized aesthetically, sociologically, psychologically, historically, politically, and so on. But at the same time, documentary filmmaking can be conceived as an intellectual discourse, what its founders called \u201ca method of philosophic reasoning\u201d (Paul Rotha), one meant to reflect or challenge certain cultural and social ideas. Despite the order of terms in the title of this course, what theory means to documentary, and vice versa, has always been an open question. This course explores various ways to answer the question.    SIGHT AND SOUND DOCUMENTARY (SUMMER COURSE) (Marco Williams)    The intensive six week summer course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and analysis of feature length and short documentaries, and hands-on directing, shooting, sound-recording, editing and re-editing, students will rigorously explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction story telling for film and video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group production work, in which each student will be expected to complete five projects. While tuition is covered, please be advised that there is a lab fee of approximately $600.   VIDEO PRODUCTION SEMINAR (Stout/Furjanic/Vail )    A two-semester seminar that provides training and equipment for advanced graduate students to produce a media ethnography or short documentary. During the fall semester, in-class instruction, lab exercises, and readings introduce digital audio and video production, including shooting and editing with HD cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Focusing on ethnographic media practices, students also address key representational, methodological, and ethical issues in the production of ethnographic documentary. By the completion of the fall term, students will have chosen a topic and field site for their final projects and completed a short video (5-10 minutes). During the spring semester, students continue to work intensively on their projects by shooting, editing, and screening their footage. The course culminates in a public screening of students\u2019 completed, 20-30 min. ethnographic documentaries. Attendance in class and lab sessions is mandatory, and students who fail to complete all fall assignments will not be allowed to register for the spring semester. Students should come into the class with a well-developed project idea.    THE SEMINAR IS RESTRICTED TO STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM IN CULTURE AND MEDIA. IT IS LIMITED TO TEN STUDENTS AND REQUIRES PERMISSION OF THE INSTRUCTOR. Culture &amp; Media I and Sight and Sound Documentary (summer session) are mandatory pre-requisites. There is no lab fee, but students are expected to provide their own videotapes. For a list of recent student documentaries click here.    SELECTED ELECTIVE COURSES/ CINEMA STUDIES and ANTHROPOLOGY/FALL 2014       Culture, Meaning and Society ANTH-GA 1222 (Rogers) This introduction to sociocultural anthropology is designed for graduate students working primarily in other disciplines, and is intended to give them a grasp of specifically anthropological ways of defining researchable questions, collecting data, and drawing inference. In the first half of the semester, we will consider the 20thcentury development of some of the basic concepts and practices that have defined the discipline (notably the culture concept, ethnographic fieldwork methods). In the second half of the semester, we will read a series of recent ethnographic case-studies to further explore current anthropological approaches to a selection of specific topics. These will be chosen largely as a function of student interests, but may include gender, religion, education, among others. *** Open only to non-Anthropology Graduate students.  Documentary Traditions CINE GT 1400 (Bagnall) Mondays 6:20 \u2013 9 PM   Fourteen sessions are devoted to a comparison of current documentaries with those made in earlier decades to illustrate how the art has responded to social, political, and economic realities and to changes in technology and systems of distribution. Undergraduates who take the course for 3 points are required to keep journals in which they respond to each session and compare observations with those made when viewing at least one documentary of their choice seen outside class, as well as in response to critical essays provided at each session and references in the text. Those wishing to earn an extra point (register for one point of H56.1097 Independent Study) may write a substantial term paper based on a topic approved by the instructor. French New Wave CINE GT 1513 (Stam) This course offers an historical and critical overview of one of the most dynamic and influential film movements within the history of the cinema -- the French New Wave \u2013 a movement that has influenced filmmakers all over the world. After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the movement in philosophical existentialism (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir) and the theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cinema, we will examine key films and directors. We will explore the three core groups that together formed the New Wave, notably 1) the Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer); 2) the Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker); and 3) Cinema Verite (Jean Rouch, Edgar Morin). While we will focus largely on the films themselves, we will situate New Wave films within a broader spectrum of philosophy, literature, and the art. Some key themes in the course will be: first-person auteur cinema; artistic modernism and the New Wave; the relation between film and the other arts; the revolution in film language; the filmic adaptation of novels; and feminism and the New Wave; race, gender and sexuality; the evolution of style; and the political evolution leading up to the near-revolution of May 1968. The course will approach the New Wave through 1) critical writing, including by the directors themselves; 2) the screening of a chronologically arranged series of feature films; and 3) the analysis of short clips related to the larger themes. The goal of the course is for students to gain an overall sense of the historical importance of the New Wave, of the characteristic styles and themes of the key directors, and of some of the theories that circulated around such films. Topics in Documentary Film CINE GT 2002 (Lee) The term \"expanded documentary\" points both to the ways in which traditional documentary practices have diversified and transformed over the last few decades, particularly with changes in media technologies, as well as to different ways we might re-examine other film, media and art traditions through the lens of documentary practice. In this course, we consider how the documentary impulse functions in film, video, animation, sound; in the gallery, in the archive, in public space, in cyberspace; in forms linear and nonlinear, online and off. We also investigate the role of documentation in relation to performance and social practice art. In tracing these variations of documentary practice over time, we approach these expanded forms of non-fiction media not as addenda to documentary traditions, but rather as opportunities to reflect critically on those traditions, to connect present developments to historical precedents, and to pry open our sense of documentary as form, endeavor and practice. (Cross-listed with CINE-UT 417) Nonfiction Film History CINE GT 2307 (Streible, TBA) This course introduces students to the study of nonfiction film. It explores the history and theory of nonfiction cinema, including\u2014but not limited to\u2014documentary film. The established milestones of the international tradition of documentary\u2014from the romantic mythmaking of Robert Flaherty to the leftist collectives and state propaganda projects of the 1930s and 1940s, through cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 of the 1960s and the activist and personal styles of recent decades\u2014are considered. But the course also places documentary in a broader context that includes forms of nonfiction typically segregated from the traditional conception of documentary. Some are somewhat familiar forms, such as actualities, travelogues, and newsreels. Others have been largely ignored by scholars until quite recently: sponsored, industrial, educational, scientific, and medical films; home movies and other amateur films; outtakes and other archival footage. Viewed both as discrete works of cinema and as artifacts of social and cultural significance, such orphaned films pose problems of history, culture, and aesthetics that challenge traditional conceptions of making, viewing, and studying films. Students read primary historical sources, as well as new scholarly approaches to the global history of nonfiction film, and to the possible uses and meanings of this vast archive.   Adv. Sem. Paradigms of Globalization CINE GT 2835 (Choi) This course examines multiple histories, structures, theories and key concepts of globalization, linking them with issues in the nation-state, post/modernity, post/colonialism, cultural imperialism, post/Fordism, empire, and trans/national identities. It brings together different forms of knowledge from anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, and political economy to bear on film and media studies troubled by geo-cultural uncertainty and convergence. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email JungBong Choi at jbc7@nyu.edu . The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/ reading/ research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar. Adv. Sem. Comparative Post-colonialism CINE GT 3207 (Stam) Alongside and in the aftermath of the \"culture wars\" in the United States, many battle lines, national and transnational, have formed around such inter-related issues as \"postcoloniality,\" \"comparative imperialism,\"\"critical race\" and so forth. Challenged and debated from many directions, the terms themselves have become subject to diverse political force-fields, in some ways becoming sliding signifiers onto which diverse groups project their hopes and fears, their fantasies and anxieties. Our seminar will focus on the ways these debates are articulated differently in three zones: the Anglo-American, the French and Francophone, and the Brazilian Lusophone. What will interest us specifically will be the process of translation through which the debates are filtered. How do the debates\"travel\" and what happens to them during the voyage? What happens in the movement from one geographical space and cultural semantics into another? How do these movements translate? What are the different vocabularies? How do the terms themselves shift political and epistemological valence? What happens, then, when \"multiculturalism\" or\"postcoloniality,\" for example, are seen through other national grids, or enter other \"intellectual fields?\" How are \"out-of-place\" ideas reinvoiced, indigenized, co-opted, contained, hybridized, recontextualized, resisted? What is elided or added, or subtly changed, in the process of cross-cultural translation? How do the debates get grafted onto other, preexisting debates? What are the mirrors and grids and prisms through which the debates are seen? What is the role of national narcissism and exceptionalism? What anxieties and Utopians come into play when debates travel? Our approach throughout will be transdisciplinary, drawing on cultural studies, media studies, literary theory, and so forth.We will address the ways that popular culture can filter and reframe the debates. Popular culture, in this sense, will be invoked as illustrative of our larger themes but also as a form of intellectual/cultural agency in a globalized world. ***Those students interested in taking this seminar should email Robert Stam at rps1@nyu.edu by April 15. The email should state your status in the grad program, any relevant past courses/reading/research, your particular interest in the seminar, and particular project, if any, that you would like to work on during the seminar.
