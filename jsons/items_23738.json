E10.2014 Location : New York, NY    Dates : January 4, 2010 through January 15, 2010    Days : Monday through Friday    Times : 10:00-12:00, lab session 1:00-2:15 This course is an introduction to the analysis and modeling of network data.  Network analysis is a key tool in understanding relational data &ndash; data  describing the relationships between pairs and groups of individuals, as well  as the global structure of relationships. We will focus on applications to and  building tools for research in the social sciences, but the methodology can be  extended to other areas. By the end of the course, you should have a working  knowledge of basic network analysis tools and be able to use them to analyze  your own data. Syllabus : E10.2014  For more information, please consult Albert. The course can be found under the Interdept Research Studies  (E10).

E10.2014 Location : New York, NY    Dates : January 4, 2010 through January 15, 2010    Days : Monday through Friday    Times : 10:00-12:00, lab session 1:00-2:15 This course is an introduction to the analysis and modeling of network data.  Network analysis is a key tool in understanding relational data &ndash; data  describing the relationships between pairs and groups of individuals, as well  as the global structure of relationships. We will focus on applications to and  building tools for research in the social sciences, but the methodology can be  extended to other areas. By the end of the course, you should have a working  knowledge of basic network analysis tools and be able to use them to analyze  your own data. Syllabus : E10.2014  For more information, please consult Albert. The course can be found under the Interdept Research Studies  (E10).
