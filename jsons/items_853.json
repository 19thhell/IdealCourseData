Compensation for teaching is approximately $5,000 per course. For more information, see fellowships and outreach . The graduate Creative Writing Program at NYU consists of a community of writers working together in a setting that is both challenging and supportive. The program provides a stimulating and creative environment that fosters the development of talented writers committed to their craft. The program is not defined by courses alone but by a life built around writing. Through innovative literary outreach programs, a distinguished public reading series, an exciting public student reading series, special literary seminars with master writers, and the production of a high-quality literary journal, students participate in a dynamic literary community actively engaged in all aspects of the literary arts--writing, reading, teaching, publishing and community outreach. Students also have the opportunity to enjoy America's most literary terrain; New York University is situated in the heart of Greenwich Village, a part of New York that has always been home to writers.
