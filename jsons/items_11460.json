The mandatory three hour training session provides a foundation of knowledge needed to be an effective ally to LGBTQ students and those questioning their sexuality. Campus wide trainings are offered multiple times every semester, but training sessions can be arranged for other groups if requested.   SAFEZONE I: NYU LGBTQ 101   This two (2) or three (3) hour training session provides a foundation of knowledge needed to be an effective ally to LGBTQ students. Individuals who complete this training and then choose to post a Safe Zone card should be comfortable with LGBTQ students approaching them to talk about LGBTQ related issues, or to help students find campus or local resources.     Safe Zone II: Dismantling Heterosexism &amp; Institutional Oppression   Heterosexism is a term that applies to attitudes, bias and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships. It includes the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the norm and therefore superior. It is the belief that everyone is or should be straight.   This safezone training will build on concepts covered in Safe Zone I. The Dismantling Heterosexism and Institutional Oppression module provides concrete examples of heterosexism; identifies how it manifests on individual, cultural and institutional levels; and provides participants with tools and strategies for challenging heterosexist practices and behavior on all of these levels.   ** This training is open to all students and staff that have completed a Safe Zone I training within the last THREE years.

Recipient of the 2014 Inaugural Spirituality and Religion in Higher Education Outstanding Spiritual Initiative Award, Faith Zone is a training workshop designed to promote spiritual and religious literacy and dialogue. NYU students, faculty, and staff members can participate in one of our Fall 2014 trainings to become Faith Zone certified. Faith Zone Trainings (FZT) are a resource for students, faculty and staff on campus who desire innovative and participatory training, contextualized resources, and honest dialogue about religion &amp; spirituality. Based upon the Safe Zone model which is used to educate groups about the LGBTQ community, these FZT sessions take a dual approach that integrates theory and practice. In doing so, FZT engages participants in activities which will increase religious literacy and offer practical tools for learning about religion and spirituality.    Topics covered include reflecting on personal experiences with faith and spirituality, examining the global and local context for various religious traditions represented at NYU, as well as discussing tips for creating a safe and welcoming environment in one\u2019s office, residence hall, student group or classroom. Participants will receive a certificate of completion and placard to display verifying the completion of the training.

The mandatory three hour training session provides a foundation of knowledge needed to be an effective ally to LGBTQ students and those questioning their sexuality. Campus wide trainings are offered multiple times every semester, but training sessions can be arranged for other groups if requested.   SAFEZONE I: NYU LGBTQ 101   This two (2) or three (3) hour training session provides a foundation of knowledge needed to be an effective ally to LGBTQ students. Individuals who complete this training and then choose to post a Safe Zone card should be comfortable with LGBTQ students approaching them to talk about LGBTQ related issues, or to help students find campus or local resources.     Safe Zone II: Dismantling Heterosexism &amp; Institutional Oppression   Heterosexism is a term that applies to attitudes, bias and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships. It includes the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the norm and therefore superior. It is the belief that everyone is or should be straight.   This safezone training will build on concepts covered in Safe Zone I. The Dismantling Heterosexism and Institutional Oppression module provides concrete examples of heterosexism; identifies how it manifests on individual, cultural and institutional levels; and provides participants with tools and strategies for challenging heterosexist practices and behavior on all of these levels.   ** This training is open to all students and staff that have completed a Safe Zone I training within the last THREE years.

Recipient of the 2014 Inaugural Spirituality and Religion in Higher Education Outstanding Spiritual Initiative Award, Faith Zone is a training workshop designed to promote spiritual and religious literacy and dialogue. NYU students, faculty, and staff members can participate in one of our Fall 2014 trainings to become Faith Zone certified. Faith Zone Trainings (FZT) are a resource for students, faculty and staff on campus who desire innovative and participatory training, contextualized resources, and honest dialogue about religion &amp; spirituality. Based upon the Safe Zone model which is used to educate groups about the LGBTQ community, these FZT sessions take a dual approach that integrates theory and practice. In doing so, FZT engages participants in activities which will increase religious literacy and offer practical tools for learning about religion and spirituality.    Topics covered include reflecting on personal experiences with faith and spirituality, examining the global and local context for various religious traditions represented at NYU, as well as discussing tips for creating a safe and welcoming environment in one\u2019s office, residence hall, student group or classroom. Participants will receive a certificate of completion and placard to display verifying the completion of the training.

Open to students, staff and faculty, Diversity Zone provides participants with tools and information on the roots, construction, and proliferation of these social identities as well as a basic understanding of the systems of privilege and oppression at work in our society. Participants in this interactive training will leave more culturally aware and competent and better prepared to become an effective ally. All those who complete Diversity Zone training will receive a participation placard acknowledging their commitment to diversity. Campus wide trainings are offered multiple times every semester, but training sessions can be arranged for other groups if requested.   For more information, please email cmep@nyu.edu .
