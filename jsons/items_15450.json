NEST-GA  2005 Lebanon and Syria,  T  2:00-4:45pm         Instructor:  Joanne Nucho      Description:   Lebanon and Syria:  Ottoman, French Mandate, Modern States The images of violence broadcast by  decades of war reporting in Lebanon and continued through news coverage of the  Syrian conflict today is often coupled with the kind of commentary that would  cast various conflict as ancient, entrenched, beyond the taming power of modern  institutions like the nation state. In this course, we will read and discuss  works that will help us question the idea of sectarianism as an ancient and  immutable form of conflict as we examine the particular histories and contestations  that shaped the emergence of Syria and Lebanon as modern nation states. In the  first part of the course, we will read histories of late Ottoman and French  Mandate rule in Greater Syria. To what extent was Lebanon\u2019s political sectarian  form of governance co-constituted by Ottoman and French officials as well as  elite networks? How did non-elite actors shape and participate in Syrian  nationalist movements? How might these histories inform contemporary discourses  and movements? In part two of the course, \u201cConflict,\u201d we will discuss the  various conflicts and massive displacements that have characterized much of the  post-Independence era in Lebanon, and more recently, Syria. The civil war  history of 1975-1990 is a much contested and unsettled topic in Lebanon.  Likewise, as the Syrian conflict unfolds, little has been produced in terms of  scholarly responses. Through fictional, filmic, journalistic and scholarly  accounts, we will explore narratives of the still highly contested civil war  and the ongoing Syrian conflict. We will also discuss the role of gender,  violence and the militarization of sects in the production of hierarchy and  conflict in everyday life. In part three, entitled \u201cSpace and Place,\u201d we will  explore the various meanings, memories, and narratives of past and present that  emerge through experiences of urban space, including the circulation of mass  media, social media and other popular images. What is the role of space and  place in the way that conflict is experienced, remembered or narrated? How can  we think about the role of infrastructure and provision of services,  particularly in times of conflict, as a powerful site for the production of  knowledge and emergent subjectivities?            NEST-GA  2785   Sociology  of the Middle East, T 4:55-7:35p,      Instructor:  Benoit Challand      Description: This graduate seminar addresses a  series of key themes taken from a sociology of the contemporary Middle East.  The course, composed of lectures and class discussions, will survey 'classical'  authors in political sociology (such as Weber, Marx, Bourdieu) and analyze how  key concepts have been operationalized by recent scholarship dealing with the  Middle East. Particular attention will be given to the classical notions of  power and domination, state, society, civility, and modernity. The purpose of  the class, beyond reading some classics in sociology, is to help students  connect empirical evidence from the region with on-going conceptual or  theoretical elaborations. The course examines some of the debates between postcolonial  and Marxist theories and how to account for capitalist pressure when connected  with the emergence of centralized forms of political authority. Authors read in  class include, among others: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Norbert Elias, Timothy  Mitchell, Frederick Cooper, Vivek Chibber, Bryan Turner, Adam Hanieh, and Salwa  Ismail.            NEST-GA  2999  Topics in Middle East Politics, M  2:00-4:45pm      Instructor:  Benoit Challand      Description:   The course surveys  past instances of revolutions in the Middle East, leading to a cross-analysis  of the wave of revolts that have affected most of the Arab countries since the  end of 2010. Particular attention will be dedicated to an in-depth understanding  of the on-going dynamics in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and Libya. Part of the course  will compare bottom-up calls for political changes, in particular civil  society\u2019s varied attempts at playing a more active role in the region. Another  section will contrast a materialist reading of the revolts (e.g. with a  detailed analysis of the regional political economy), with institutionalist  analyses of the uprisings (e.g. how historically weak or strong institutions in  the region might explain some of the current difficulties in the various  countries). A last section will shed light on the nascent historiography of the  revolts, contrasting how early positive interpretations have turned into much  more sobering accounts of how conservative forces might be keeping or regaining  the upper hand in many Arab countries. Requisites: Students must have taken at  least one class on the modern Middle East to attend the course. This is a  graduate seminar, which requests a familiarity with modern history of the  region and of the political systems. Course Meets in SILK BUILDING 14 E. 4  Street, room 311.                MEIS            Colloquial  Levantine Arabic, M/T/W/TH 9:30-10:45a (Room LL2)      MEIS  will begin offering a dialect of Arabic each semester. In spring 2015, we will  offer Levantine Arabic, the spoken Arabic of the Syrians, Jordanians,  Palestinians and Lebanese. These varieties are very similar. In the ensuing  fall 2015 semester, we may offer colloquial Egyptian, Gulf, Iraqi or another  dialect of Arabic depending on students' demand at the time. Colloquial Arabic  has a graduate number but it is open to both grads and undergrads and they both  get credit for it. The pre-requisite is the successful completion of a minimum  of 3 semesters of Arabic (Intermediate Arabic I) of Modern Standard Arabic  (MSA) but those who have successfully completed 4 semesters of MSA may benefit  more from the new course. Please note  that you cannot use this course instead of Intermediate Arabic II to  meet NYU's Language Requirement. You must complete the latter in order to meet  the language requirement. You may take Colloquial Arabic in addition to your  MSA course provided that you do meet the pre-requisite of the former.  Colloquial Levantine Arabic in spring 2015 will meet from 9:30 to 10:45 am  MTuWTh at LL2 in the basement of the Kevorkian. Best wishes.            Classical  Arabic Texts, T/TH 3:30 \u2013 4:45pm (Room LL2)      Instructor:  Everett Rowson      Description:   This course is designed to offer students with considerable  modern Arabic language training (at least three years) help in dealing with  pre-modern texts. Besides a thorough  grammar review (with weekly exercises), attention will be paid to using  medieval Arabic dictionaries, consulting biographical dictionaries, coping with  Arabic manuscripts, and learning the meters of Arabic poetry, among other  skills. There will be weekly readings from a varied selection of classical  texts.            Transnationalism  &amp; The Middle East ,  W 2:00-4:45pm (Room LL2)      Instructor:  Arang Keshavarzian      Description:   In this seminar we will consider how and why the Middle East  has been shaped by intra-regional, trans-regional, and international  processes\u2014economic, political, cultural, and intellectual. As such we will examine such issues as  migration, capitalist integration, the political economy of oil, and  transnational forms of cultural production and consumption. The objectives of the course are to gain a  more thorough empirical understanding of the ways that the region has been  integrated, positioned, and imagined in global processes and hierarchies as  well as reflect on theoretical and methodological debates in the social  sciences about such topics as multi-scaler analysis, capitalism, imperialism,  and identity formation. Ultimately, this  seminar ponders the very notion of \u201cthe Middle East and North Africa\u201d as a  region and category of analysis.            Cultural Studies and Its Theoretical  Legacies:       Orientalism, Human Rights,  Neoliberalism and the Middle East , T  4:55 PM-7:35pm       Instructor:  Asli Igsiz             This course will introduce the  students to the issues, concepts, and theories that played a pivotal role in  Cultural Studies--a contemporary political and critical theory movement. These  issues include unveiling patterns of domination, power, socio-cultural change,  and social injustice. In that light, we will identify some key patterns of  domination such as colonialism, humanitarianism, surveillance, and  neoliberalism, and will reconsider Cultural Studies from the point of view of  the Middle East.

Modern  Iran: The 1979 Revolution to the Present, M  2:00-4:45pm (Room LL2)      Instructor:  Nahid Mozaffari      Description:   In this graduate seminar, we will begin by surveying the  (applicable) theoretical literature about revolutions and proceed with an  examination of the social, economic, and political conditions in the Pahlavi  era, the development of articulations of dissent among different segments of  society, and the ideologies and strategies of anti-regime forces. We will then  follow the course of the revolution and the factors and events that led to the  establishment of the Islamic Republic. Subsequent topics of discussion will  include the Hostage Crisis, the Iran-Iraq War, the evolution of the state and  its executive, legislative, military and civilian institutions, changes in the  constitution and the institution of Velayat-e faghih, and regional and foreign  policy. Finally, we will review the regime\u2019s policies towards dissidents,  minorities, youth, civil society, and peaceful protest movements. Our sources  and discussion throughout the course will be informed by the importance of  gender and the women\u2019s movement in the development, consolidation and  contestation of the Islamic Republic.
