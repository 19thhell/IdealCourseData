In May, federal prosecutors sent a signal that no bank is too big to escape criminal sanctions, when they pressured Credit Suisse's parent company to plead guilty to conspiracy to aid and assist U.S. taxpayers file false tax returns; the bank paid $2.6 billion, the highest amount ever in a criminal tax case. Later in the summer, BNP Paribas agreed to pay $8.9 billion for illegally processing financial transactions for countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions. The move came after BNP separately pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and filing false business records in New York state court. These convictions were made possible, in part, by coordinated enforcement between the U.S. Attorney's office, New York Attorney General and New York Department of Financial Services. Join us for an in-depth discussion of how these convictions came about and what they portend for the future. The panelists included four people who were on the front lines, both for the prosecution and the defense. View full program here .

In May, federal prosecutors sent a signal that no bank is too big to escape criminal sanctions, when they pressured Credit Suisse's parent company to plead guilty to conspiracy to aid and assist U.S. taxpayers file false tax returns; the bank paid $2.6 billion, the highest amount ever in a criminal tax case. Later in the summer, BNP Paribas agreed to pay $8.9 billion for illegally processing financial transactions for countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions. The move came after BNP separately pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and filing false business records in New York state court. These convictions were made possible, in part, by coordinated enforcement between the U.S. Attorney's office, New York Attorney General and New York Department of Financial Services. Join us for an in-depth discussion of how these convictions came about and what they portend for the future. The panelists included four people who were on the front lines, both for the prosecution and the defense. View full program here .

These standards have a number of key elements that have been incorporated into the University\u2019s Compliance and Risk Program, including an effective compliance program structure, compliance risk assessments, monitoring and corrective action plans, and compliance policies, training and communication.     \u2022 Governance: The University\u2019s governing authority, through the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Trustees, is knowledgeable about the content and operation of the University\u2019s Compliance Program and exercises reasonable oversight over its implementation and effectiveness.    \u2022 Executive Oversight: Through the University Compliance and Risk Steering Committee, high-level management exercises overall responsibility for the Compliance Program.     \u2022 Day-to-Day Oversight: Designated responsible compliance and risk officers exercise day-to-day responsibility for the Compliance and Risk Program. Their activities are coordinated through several compliance and risk committees whose members include administrative and academic officers as well as representatives of the University\u2019s global campuses.     \u2022 University\u2019s Chief Global Compliance Officer: assists in coordinating the University\u2019s compliance activities and reports regularly the results of these activities directly to high-level management and the Audit and Compliance Committee.    \u2022 Compliance Risk Assesment: a primary purpose of the University\u2019s Compliance and Risk Program is to identify and assess significant compliance risks and implement internal controls to reduce these risks. As noted above, the University\u2019s Compliance Program is part of an overall ERM Program and its regular, periodic risk assessments are based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 31000, an internationally accepted ERM standard.     \u2022 Monitoring and Corrective Action Plans: Steps are taken to achieve compliance through systems of monitoring, auditing and reporting suspected wrongdoing without fear of reprisal.     \u2022 Compliance Policies, Training and Communication: Effective compliance communication to all levels of employees is achieved through readily available compliance policies found at nyu.edu/policies; training programs on these compliance policies and the University\u2019s Code of Ethical Conduct; compliance publications and newsletters, and systems for responding to individual inquiries and complaints.
