Despite of being serially uncorrelated, the series &#949; t does not need to be serially independent. For instance, it can present conditional heteroskedasticity. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity ( GARCH ) model assumes a specific parametric form for this conditional heteroskedasticity. More specifically, we say that &#949; t ~ GARCH if we can write &#949; t = &#x3c3; t z t , where z t is standard Gaussian and:      &#x3c3; t 2   =   &#969;   +   &#945; &#949; t - 1 2   +   &#946; &#x3c3; t - 1 2       Estimation    V-Lab estimates all the parameters &#956; &#969; &#945; &#946; simultaneously, by maximizing the log likelihood. The assumption that z t is Gaussian does not imply the the returns are Gaussian. Even though their conditional distribution is Gaussian, it can be proved that their unconditional distribution presents excess kurtosis (fat tails). In fact, assuming that the conditional distribution is Gaussian is not as restrictive as it seems: even if the true distribution is different, the so-called Quasi-Maximum Likelihood (QML) estimator is still consistent, under fairly mild regularity conditions.     Besides leptokurtic returns, the GARCH model captures other stylized facts in financial time series, like volatility clustering. The volatility is more likely to be high at time t if it was also high at time t - 1 . Another way of seeing this is noting that a shock at time t - 1 also impacts the variance at time t . However, if &#945; + &#946; &lt; 1 , the volatility itself is mean reverting, and it fluctuates around &#x3c3; , the square root of the unconditional variance:      &#x3c3; 2   &#x2254;   Var r t   =      &#969;    1 - &#945; - &#946;         Usual restrictions on the parameters are &#969; &#945; &#946; &gt; 0 though it is possible to have &#969; = 0 and &#945; + &#946; = 1 . The conditional variance is then an integrated process (shocks to the variance are persistent), hence the model is called IGARCH (Integrated GARCH ). This is the model RiskMetrics uses to compute Value-at-Risk ( VaR ).     Prediction    Let r T be the last observation in the sample, and let &#969; &#94; ,  &#945; &#94; and &#946; &#94; be the QML estimators of the parameters &#969; , &#945; and &#946; , respectively. The GARCH model implies that the forecast of the conditional variance at time T + h is:         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h    2     =   &#969; &#94;   +         &#945; &#94;    +    &#946; &#94;           &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h - 1    2         and so, by applying the above formula iteratively, we can forecast the conditional variance for any horizon h . Then, the forecast of the compound volatility at time T + h is         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + 1 : T + h     =             &#x2211;     i = 1     h             &#x3c3; &#94;    T + i    2             Notice that, for large h , this forecast of the compound volatility converges to:         h           &#969; &#94;    1 - &#945; &#94; - &#946; &#94;            scaling over the forecast horizon with the well known square-root law, times the estimate of the unconditional volatility implied by the GARCH model.

Contents         V-Lab     Applications       Models               GARCH-DCC Model    Definition    Consider n time series of returns and make the usual assumption that returns are serially uncorrelated. Then, we can define a vector of zero-mean white noises &#949; t = r t - &#956; , where r t is the n &#x2a2f; 1 vector of returns and &#956; is the vector of expected returns.     Despite of being serially uncorrelated, the returns may present contemporaneous correlation. That is:      &#x2211; t   &#x2254;   &#120124; t - 1                 r t - &#956;                        r t - &#956;             '              may not be a diagonal matrix. Moreover, this contemporaneous variance may be time-varying, depending on past information.     The GARCH-DCC involves two steps. The first step accounts for the conditional heteroskedasticity. It consists in estimating, for each one of the n series of returns r t i , its conditional volatility &#x3c3; t i using a GARCH model ( see garch documentation ). Let D t be a diagonal matrix with these conditional volatilities, i.e. D t i , i = &#x3c3; t i and, if i &#x2260; j , D t i , j = 0 . Then the standardized residuals are:      &#x3bd; t   &#x2254;   D t -1         r t    -    &#956;            and notice that these standardized residuals have unit conditional volatility. Now, define the matrix:      R &#95;   &#x2254;   1 T      &#x2211;    t = 1    T     &#x3bd; t   &#x3bd; t '        This is the Bollerslev's Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) Estimator (Bollerslev, 1990).     The second step consists in generalizing Bollerslev's CCC to capture dynamics in the correlation, hence the name Dynamic Conditional Correlation ( DCC ). The DCC correlations are:      Q t   =   R &#95;   +   &#945;         &#x3bd; t - 1    &#x3bd; t - 1 '    -    R &#95;        +   &#946;         Q t - 1    -    R &#95;            So, Q t i , j  is the correlation between r t i and r t j at time t , and that is what is plotted by V-Lab.     Estimation    The estimation of one GARCH model for each of the n time series of returns in the first step is standard. For details on GARCH estimation, see garch documentation .     For the second step, which is the DCC estimation per se, V-Lab estimates both parameters, &#945; and &#946; , simultaneously, by maximizing the log likelihood. The standardized residuals are assumed to be jointly Gaussian. To ease the computation cost of estimating a vast dimensional time-varying correlation model, V-Lab uses a technique called composite likelihood (Engle et al., 2007).     The DCC model captures a stylized facts in financial time series: correlation clustering. The correlation is more likely to be high at time t if it was also high at time t - 1 . Another way of seeing this is noting that a shock at time t - 1 also impacts the correlation at time t . However, if &#945; + &#946; &lt; 1 , the correlation itself is mean reverting, and it fluctuates around R &#95; , the unconditional correlation.     Usual restrictions on the parameters are &#945; &#946; &gt; 0 . Though, it is possible to have &#945; + &#946; = 1 ; the conditional correlation is then an integrated process.     Variance Targeting    Notice that if we had written the DCC model in a fashion similar to the GARCH model:      Q t   =   &#x3a9;   +   &#945;   &#x3bd; t - 1   &#x3bd; t - 1 '   +   &#946;   Q t - 1       we would have to estimate the matrix &#x3a9; also. That is, instead of estimating only two parameters, we would have to estimate 2 + n n + 1 2 parameters (it is not 2 + n 2 parameters due to the fact that &#x3a9; is a symmetric matrix). And then the unconditional correlation implied by the model would have been:      R &#95;   =      &#x3a9;    1 - &#945; - &#946;         Instead of estimating &#x3a9; , notice that we actually substituted &#x3a9; by R &#95;  1 - &#945; - &#946;  in the DCC formula, which is a much more parsimonious way of writing the model. This is called Variance Targeting, introduced by Engle and Mezrich in 1995, and it is a very useful technique when modeling vast dimensional time-varying covariance or correlation models.     DCC(p,q)    The specific model just described can be generalized in two ways.     In the first stage, each GARCH specification used to standardize each one of the n return time series can be generalized to a GARCH p q model ( see garch documentation ), where p and q can be chosen differently for each return time series, for instance, by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIN), also known as Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), or by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The former tends to be more parsimonious than the latter. V-Lab uses p = 1 and q = 1 though, because this is usually the option that best fits financial time series.     In the second stage, the DCC model can be generalized to account for more lags in the conditional correlation. A DCC p q model assumes that:      Q t   =   R &#95;   +      &#x2211;    i = 1    p     &#945; i         &#x3bd; t - i    &#x3bd; t - i '    -    R &#95;        +      &#x2211;    j = 1    q     &#946; j         Q t - j    -    R &#95;            where p and q can be chosen, for instance, by information criterion. Again, V-Lab uses p = 1 and q = 1 though, because this is usually the option that best fits financial time series.     Bibliography    Bollerslev, T., 1990.

Despite of being serially uncorrelated, the series &#949; t does not need to be serially independent. For instance, it can present conditional heteroskedasticity. The Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH ( GJR-GARCH ) model assumes a specific parametric form for this conditional heteroskedasticity. More specifically, we say that &#949; t ~ GJR-GARCH if we can write &#949; t = &#x3c3; t z t , where z t is standard Gaussian and:      &#x3c3; t 2   =   &#969;   +    &#945; + &#947; I t - 1  &#949; t - 1 2   +   &#946; &#x3c3; t - 1 2       where      I t - 1   &#x2254;      {               0            if&#xa0; r t - 1 &#x2265; &#956;                   1            if&#xa0; r t - 1 &lt; &#956;                    Estimation    V-Lab estimates all the parameters &#956; &#969; &#945; &#947; &#946; simultaneously, by maximizing the log likelihood. The assumption that z t is Gaussian does not imply the the returns are Gaussian. Even though their conditional distribution is Gaussian, it can be proved that their unconditional distribution presents excess kurtosis (fat tails). In fact, assuming that the conditional distribution is Gaussian is not as restrictive as it seems: even if the true distribution is different, the so-called Quasi-Maximum Likelihood (QML) estimator is still consistent, under fairly mild regularity conditions.     Besides leptokurtic returns, the GJR-GARCH model, like the GARCH model, captures other stylized facts in financial time series, like volatility clustering. The volatility is more likely to be high at time t if it was also high at time t - 1 . Another way of seeing this is noting that a shock at time t - 1 also impacts the variance at time t . However, if &#945; + &#947; 2 + &#946; &lt; 1 , the volatility itself is mean reverting, and it fluctuates around &#x3c3; , the square root of the unconditional variance      &#x3c3; 2   &#x2254;   Var r t   =      &#969;    1 - &#945; - &#947; 2 - &#946;         where the 1 2 multiplying &#947; comes from the normality assumption of z t . More intuitively, it comes from the assumption that the conditional distribution of the returns is symmetric around &#956; .     Usual restrictions on the parameters are &#969; &#945; &#947; &#946; > 0 . The GARCH model is in fact a restricted version of the GJR-GARCH , with &#947; = 0 .     Prediction    Let r t be the last observation in the sample, and let &#969; &#94; , &#945; &#94; , &#947; &#94; and &#946; &#94; be the QML estimators of the parameters &#969; , &#945; , &#947; and &#946; , respectively. The GJR-GARCH model implies that the forecast of the conditional variance at time T + h is:         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h    2     =   &#969; &#94;   +         &#945; &#94;    +     &#947; &#94; 2    +    &#946; &#94;           &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h - 1    2          and so, by applying the above formula iteratively, we can forecast the conditional variance for any horizon h . Then, the forecast of the compound volatility at time T + h is         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + 1 : T + h     =             &#x2211;     i = 1     h             &#x3c3; &#94;    T + i    2            Notice that, for large h , the forecast of the compound volatility converges to:         h           &#969; &#94;    1 - &#945; &#94; - &#947; &#94; 2 - &#946; &#94;            scaling over the forecast horizon with the well known square-root law, times the estimate of the unconditional volatility implied by the GJR-GARCH model. Again, the 1 2 multiplying &#947; comes from the assumption of symmetric conditional distribution for the returns.     GJR-GARCH vs. GARCH    There is a stylized fact that the GJR-GARCH model captures that is not contemplated by the GARCH model, which is the empirically observed fact that negative shocks at time t - 1 have a stronger impact in the variance at time t than positive shocks. This asymmetry used to be called leverage effect because the increase in risk was believed to come from the increased leverage induced by a negative shock, but nowadays we know that this channel is just too small. Notice that the effective coefficient associated with a negative shock is &#945; + &#947; . In financial time series, we generally find that &#947; is statistically significant.     GJR-GARCH(p,q)    The specific model just described can be generalized to account for more lags in the conditional variance. A GJR-GARCH p q model assumes that:         &#x3c3;    t    2     =   &#969;   +      &#x2211;    i = 1    p      &#945; i + &#947; i I t - i       &#949;    t - i    2     +      &#x2211;    j = 1    q     &#946; j      &#x3c3;    t - j    2         The best model ( p and q ) can be chosen, for instance, by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also known as Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), or by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The former tends to be more parsimonious than the latter. V-Lab uses p = 1 and q = 1 though, because this is usually the option that best fits financial time series.     Bibliography    Glosten, L.

Despite of being serially uncorrelated, the series &#949; t does not need to be serially independent. For instance, it can present conditional heteroskedasticity. The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity ( GARCH ) model assumes a specific parametric form for this conditional heteroskedasticity. More specifically, we say that &#949; t ~ GARCH if we can write &#949; t = &#x3c3; t z t , where z t is standard Gaussian and:      &#x3c3; t 2   =   &#969;   +   &#945; &#949; t - 1 2   +   &#946; &#x3c3; t - 1 2       Estimation    V-Lab estimates all the parameters &#956; &#969; &#945; &#946; simultaneously, by maximizing the log likelihood. The assumption that z t is Gaussian does not imply the the returns are Gaussian. Even though their conditional distribution is Gaussian, it can be proved that their unconditional distribution presents excess kurtosis (fat tails). In fact, assuming that the conditional distribution is Gaussian is not as restrictive as it seems: even if the true distribution is different, the so-called Quasi-Maximum Likelihood (QML) estimator is still consistent, under fairly mild regularity conditions.     Besides leptokurtic returns, the GARCH model captures other stylized facts in financial time series, like volatility clustering. The volatility is more likely to be high at time t if it was also high at time t - 1 . Another way of seeing this is noting that a shock at time t - 1 also impacts the variance at time t . However, if &#945; + &#946; &lt; 1 , the volatility itself is mean reverting, and it fluctuates around &#x3c3; , the square root of the unconditional variance:      &#x3c3; 2   &#x2254;   Var r t   =      &#969;    1 - &#945; - &#946;         Usual restrictions on the parameters are &#969; &#945; &#946; &gt; 0 though it is possible to have &#969; = 0 and &#945; + &#946; = 1 . The conditional variance is then an integrated process (shocks to the variance are persistent), hence the model is called IGARCH (Integrated GARCH ). This is the model RiskMetrics uses to compute Value-at-Risk ( VaR ).     Prediction    Let r T be the last observation in the sample, and let &#969; &#94; ,  &#945; &#94; and &#946; &#94; be the QML estimators of the parameters &#969; , &#945; and &#946; , respectively. The GARCH model implies that the forecast of the conditional variance at time T + h is:         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h    2     =   &#969; &#94;   +         &#945; &#94;    +    &#946; &#94;           &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h - 1    2         and so, by applying the above formula iteratively, we can forecast the conditional variance for any horizon h . Then, the forecast of the compound volatility at time T + h is         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + 1 : T + h     =             &#x2211;     i = 1     h             &#x3c3; &#94;    T + i    2             Notice that, for large h , this forecast of the compound volatility converges to:         h           &#969; &#94;    1 - &#945; &#94; - &#946; &#94;            scaling over the forecast horizon with the well known square-root law, times the estimate of the unconditional volatility implied by the GARCH model.     GARCH(p,q)    The specific model just described can be generalized to account for more lags in the conditional variance. A GARCH p q model assumes that:         &#x3c3;    t    2     =   &#969;   +      &#x2211;    i = 1    q     &#945; i      &#949;    t - i    2     +      &#x2211;    j = 1    p     &#946; j      &#x3c3;    t - j    2         The best model ( p and q ) can be chosen, for instance, by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also known as Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), or by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

Contents         V-Lab     Applications       Models               GARCH-DCC Model    Definition    Consider n time series of returns and make the usual assumption that returns are serially uncorrelated. Then, we can define a vector of zero-mean white noises &#949; t = r t - &#956; , where r t is the n &#x2a2f; 1 vector of returns and &#956; is the vector of expected returns.     Despite of being serially uncorrelated, the returns may present contemporaneous correlation. That is:      &#x2211; t   &#x2254;   &#120124; t - 1                 r t - &#956;                        r t - &#956;             '              may not be a diagonal matrix. Moreover, this contemporaneous variance may be time-varying, depending on past information.     The GARCH-DCC involves two steps. The first step accounts for the conditional heteroskedasticity. It consists in estimating, for each one of the n series of returns r t i , its conditional volatility &#x3c3; t i using a GARCH model ( see garch documentation ). Let D t be a diagonal matrix with these conditional volatilities, i.e. D t i , i = &#x3c3; t i and, if i &#x2260; j , D t i , j = 0 . Then the standardized residuals are:      &#x3bd; t   &#x2254;   D t -1         r t    -    &#956;            and notice that these standardized residuals have unit conditional volatility. Now, define the matrix:      R &#95;   &#x2254;   1 T      &#x2211;    t = 1    T     &#x3bd; t   &#x3bd; t '        This is the Bollerslev's Constant Conditional Correlation (CCC) Estimator (Bollerslev, 1990).     The second step consists in generalizing Bollerslev's CCC to capture dynamics in the correlation, hence the name Dynamic Conditional Correlation ( DCC ). The DCC correlations are:      Q t   =   R &#95;   +   &#945;         &#x3bd; t - 1    &#x3bd; t - 1 '    -    R &#95;        +   &#946;         Q t - 1    -    R &#95;            So, Q t i , j  is the correlation between r t i and r t j at time t , and that is what is plotted by V-Lab.     Estimation    The estimation of one GARCH model for each of the n time series of returns in the first step is standard. For details on GARCH estimation, see garch documentation .     For the second step, which is the DCC estimation per se, V-Lab estimates both parameters, &#945; and &#946; , simultaneously, by maximizing the log likelihood. The standardized residuals are assumed to be jointly Gaussian. To ease the computation cost of estimating a vast dimensional time-varying correlation model, V-Lab uses a technique called composite likelihood (Engle et al., 2007).     The DCC model captures a stylized facts in financial time series: correlation clustering. The correlation is more likely to be high at time t if it was also high at time t - 1 . Another way of seeing this is noting that a shock at time t - 1 also impacts the correlation at time t . However, if &#945; + &#946; &lt; 1 , the correlation itself is mean reverting, and it fluctuates around R &#95; , the unconditional correlation.     Usual restrictions on the parameters are &#945; &#946; &gt; 0 . Though, it is possible to have &#945; + &#946; = 1 ; the conditional correlation is then an integrated process.     Variance Targeting    Notice that if we had written the DCC model in a fashion similar to the GARCH model:      Q t   =   &#x3a9;   +   &#945;   &#x3bd; t - 1   &#x3bd; t - 1 '   +   &#946;   Q t - 1       we would have to estimate the matrix &#x3a9; also. That is, instead of estimating only two parameters, we would have to estimate 2 + n n + 1 2 parameters (it is not 2 + n 2 parameters due to the fact that &#x3a9; is a symmetric matrix). And then the unconditional correlation implied by the model would have been:      R &#95;   =      &#x3a9;    1 - &#945; - &#946;         Instead of estimating &#x3a9; , notice that we actually substituted &#x3a9; by R &#95;  1 - &#945; - &#946;  in the DCC formula, which is a much more parsimonious way of writing the model. This is called Variance Targeting, introduced by Engle and Mezrich in 1995, and it is a very useful technique when modeling vast dimensional time-varying covariance or correlation models.     DCC(p,q)    The specific model just described can be generalized in two ways.     In the first stage, each GARCH specification used to standardize each one of the n return time series can be generalized to a GARCH p q model ( see garch documentation ), where p and q can be chosen differently for each return time series, for instance, by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIN), also known as Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), or by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The former tends to be more parsimonious than the latter. V-Lab uses p = 1 and q = 1 though, because this is usually the option that best fits financial time series.     In the second stage, the DCC model can be generalized to account for more lags in the conditional correlation. A DCC p q model assumes that:      Q t   =   R &#95;   +      &#x2211;    i = 1    p     &#945; i         &#x3bd; t - i    &#x3bd; t - i '    -    R &#95;        +      &#x2211;    j = 1    q     &#946; j         Q t - j    -    R &#95;            where p and q can be chosen, for instance, by information criterion. Again, V-Lab uses p = 1 and q = 1 though, because this is usually the option that best fits financial time series.     Bibliography    Bollerslev, T., 1990.

Despite of being serially uncorrelated, the series &#949; t does not need to be serially independent. For instance, it can present conditional heteroskedasticity. The Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH ( GJR-GARCH ) model assumes a specific parametric form for this conditional heteroskedasticity. More specifically, we say that &#949; t ~ GJR-GARCH if we can write &#949; t = &#x3c3; t z t , where z t is standard Gaussian and:      &#x3c3; t 2   =   &#969;   +    &#945; + &#947; I t - 1  &#949; t - 1 2   +   &#946; &#x3c3; t - 1 2       where      I t - 1   &#x2254;      {               0            if&#xa0; r t - 1 &#x2265; &#956;                   1            if&#xa0; r t - 1 &lt; &#956;                    Estimation    V-Lab estimates all the parameters &#956; &#969; &#945; &#947; &#946; simultaneously, by maximizing the log likelihood.

Besides leptokurtic returns, the GJR-GARCH model, like the GARCH model, captures other stylized facts in financial time series, like volatility clustering. The volatility is more likely to be high at time t if it was also high at time t - 1 . Another way of seeing this is noting that a shock at time t - 1 also impacts the variance at time t . However, if &#945; + &#947; 2 + &#946; &lt; 1 , the volatility itself is mean reverting, and it fluctuates around &#x3c3; , the square root of the unconditional variance      &#x3c3; 2   &#x2254;   Var r t   =      &#969;    1 - &#945; - &#947; 2 - &#946;         where the 1 2 multiplying &#947; comes from the normality assumption of z t . More intuitively, it comes from the assumption that the conditional distribution of the returns is symmetric around &#956; .     Usual restrictions on the parameters are &#969; &#945; &#947; &#946; > 0 . The GARCH model is in fact a restricted version of the GJR-GARCH , with &#947; = 0 .     Prediction    Let r t be the last observation in the sample, and let &#969; &#94; , &#945; &#94; , &#947; &#94; and &#946; &#94; be the QML estimators of the parameters &#969; , &#945; , &#947; and &#946; , respectively. The GJR-GARCH model implies that the forecast of the conditional variance at time T + h is:         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h    2     =   &#969; &#94;   +         &#945; &#94;    +     &#947; &#94; 2    +    &#946; &#94;           &#x3c3; &#94;    T + h - 1    2          and so, by applying the above formula iteratively, we can forecast the conditional variance for any horizon h . Then, the forecast of the compound volatility at time T + h is         &#x3c3; &#94;    T + 1 : T + h     =             &#x2211;     i = 1     h             &#x3c3; &#94;    T + i    2            Notice that, for large h , the forecast of the compound volatility converges to:         h           &#969; &#94;    1 - &#945; &#94; - &#947; &#94; 2 - &#946; &#94;            scaling over the forecast horizon with the well known square-root law, times the estimate of the unconditional volatility implied by the GJR-GARCH model. Again, the 1 2 multiplying &#947; comes from the assumption of symmetric conditional distribution for the returns.     GJR-GARCH vs. GARCH    There is a stylized fact that the GJR-GARCH model captures that is not contemplated by the GARCH model, which is the empirically observed fact that negative shocks at time t - 1 have a stronger impact in the variance at time t than positive shocks. This asymmetry used to be called leverage effect because the increase in risk was believed to come from the increased leverage induced by a negative shock, but nowadays we know that this channel is just too small. Notice that the effective coefficient associated with a negative shock is &#945; + &#947; . In financial time series, we generally find that &#947; is statistically significant.     GJR-GARCH(p,q)    The specific model just described can be generalized to account for more lags in the conditional variance. A GJR-GARCH p q model assumes that:         &#x3c3;    t    2     =   &#969;   +      &#x2211;    i = 1    p      &#945; i + &#947; i I t - i       &#949;    t - i    2     +      &#x2211;    j = 1    q     &#946; j      &#x3c3;    t - j    2         The best model ( p and q ) can be chosen, for instance, by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also known as Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), or by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
