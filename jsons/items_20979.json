Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Continuation of CAP-GP 3801.      As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.

Specific topics include financial and managerial accounting, financial statements, business plans, budgeting, capital planning, cost accounting, managerial control, working capital management and payment systems.   Financial managers measure the flow of funds into and out of the organization, plan for investments in buildings and new technology, and forecast future surpluses and deficits for the organization as a whole and its various departments. Financial managers work closely with accountants, administrators, computer programmers, records managers and planners whose decisions have a considerable impact on the financial status of organizations. They, in turn, rely upon the financial managers skills and advice to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities.

Specific topics include financial and managerial accounting, financial statements, business plans, budgeting, capital planning, cost accounting, managerial control, working capital management and payment systems.   Financial managers measure the flow of funds into and out of the organization, plan for investments in buildings and new technology, and forecast future surpluses and deficits for the organization as a whole and its various departments. Financial managers work closely with accountants, administrators, computer programmers, records managers and planners whose decisions have a considerable impact on the financial status of organizations. They, in turn, rely upon the financial managers skills and advice to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities.

As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.

Financial managers work closely with accountants, administrators, computer programmers, records managers and planners whose decisions have a considerable impact on the financial status of organizations. They, in turn, rely upon the financial managers skills and advice to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities.
