PRACTICE is known the world over for attracting some of the biggest and most exciting names in game design. This year\u2019s attendees will include indie game grandmaster Jonathan Blow; live action innovator Holly Gramazio; Jake Elliot and Tamas Kemenczy of Kentucky Route Zero; and John Popaduik, renown pinball game designer, to name a few.   \u201cPRACTICE is a fantastic opportunity for game designers to mix with and learn from each other,\u201d said Frank Lantz, chair of the Game Center at the NYU Tisch School of the Arts. \u201cAs with all creative forms, game design benefits from a community in which individuals can share their ideas, knowledge, passion, and inspirations. And while PRACTICE is focused on game design, it is platform agnostic, encompassing designers that run the gamut from live action to console, and from iPhone apps to board games.\u201d   PRACTICE takes a close look at the concrete challenges of game design, bridging dialog across industries. In addition to panels and speakers, PRACTICE also hosts parties and intense sessions like the annual Open Problems \u2013 where anyone can grab the mic and ask a question to the assembled game design minds.   This year marks the fourth in which NYU has hosted PRACTICE, and continues the tradition of drawing a wide range of expert speakers, the full list of which includes the following:   \u2022  Jonathan Blow (Braid, The Witness)  \u2022  Zach Gage (SpellTower, Ridiculous Fishing)  \u2022  Jake Elliot &amp; Tamas Kemenczy (Kentucky Route Zero)  \u2022  Holly Gramazio (Room Number, 99 Tiny Games)  \u2022  Samantha Kalman (Sentris)  \u2022  David Kanaga (Proteus, Dyad)  \u2022  Deirdra Kiai (Dominique Pamplemousse in 'It's All Over Once The Fat Lady Sings!', Coffee: A Misunderstanding)  \u2022  Lukas Litzsinger (Android: Netrunner, The Lord of the Rings Living Card Game)  \u2022  Colleen Macklin (Re:Activism, Budgetball)  \u2022  Drew Murray (Sunset Overrdrive, Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction)  \u2022  John Popaduik (pinball innovator, Nanoschool Project)  \u2022  Shawn Snelling &amp; Salvatore Garozzo (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive map designers)  \u2022  Asher Volmer (Threes, Puzzlejuice)   All PRACTICE events will be held at 19 W. 4th Street, between Mercer and Green streets.

About the NYU Game Center  The NYU Game Center was established in 2008 at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts to explore the design and development of games as a creative practice. The program offers both a two-year Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) program as well as an undergraduate Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in game design degree program. In fall 2013, the Game Center became part of the NYU MAGNET Center in downtown Brooklyn, creating a multidisciplinary hub incorporating engineering, computer science and education in order to further the Game Center\u2019s mission of establishing New York City as a center of innovation in the growing field of game design.

Where game designers of every stripe butt heads, share ideas, and break bread together.   PRACTICE is an annual event that takes a close look at the concrete challenges of game design, bridging dialog across industries. Where else can a console developer discuss level design with a tabletop RPG writer? Or an iPhone puzzle creator debate economy balancing with collectable card game designer? Or a professional sports official share secrets with an experimental indie game artist? No other conference brings together such a diverse group of game designers for high-level dialog.         We explore the day-t0-day, nuts and bolts practice of game design \u2013 where the rubber of design ideas and methods meets the road  of meaningful, playable games. Join us for three days of lectures and panels, workshops and discussions, mixed with plenty of  game-playing and socializing.      For extensive videos from past years, check out our archive here.      PRACTICE in the press        The first two years of PRACTICE included an amazing lineup of speakers, from paper game legends like Richard Garfield and Renier Knitizia to videogame's newest stars like  Manveer Heir and Matt Boch. Below is some of our favorite coverage from past years:      Unwinnable \u2013 Game Design for the Player       Gamasutra \u2013 The Immense Responsibility of Creating Value for Players       Kill Screen \u2013 For Us, By Us .         Gamasutra - In Depth The Nature And Purpose Of PRACTICE At NYU .         Destructoid \u2013 Game Design in Detail Impressions .         Kotaku \u2013 If Video Game Developers Could Redesign Football .         Gamasutra \u2013 Irrational&rsquo;s Gaynor On Better Storytelling Player Freedom Through Gating .                  Three Questions with a Game Designer   Game Center MFA students ask the speakers and panelists three questions about their design process, philopshy and strategies. Check here for more interviews as they come in.   An intimate gathering of top designers    PRACTICE is designed for a high-level exchange of ideas among professional game designers. Game design is a complex multi-threaded discipline, and PRACTICE is a unique opportunity to understand and refine what we do when we design games.    Lectures       Each year PRACTICE features presentations from a variety of expert and accomplished game designers. Speakers focus on design challenges and solutions in a wide range of games, from AAA videogames to collectable card games, to indie experiments to military simulations.   Watch a video of Robert Yang's lecture from PRACTICE 2013. More lectures are on our vimeo page.      Panels       In addition to individual speakers, PRACTICE features panels organized around topics of interest to working game designers. These panels allow speakers to exchange ideas more freely with each other and the attendees.   Open Problem Session       Open Problems is a high-energy &quot;open mic&quot; session in which any conference attendee can present a work or idea in progress for discussion and feedback.      Socializing       The best conversations often take place outside of the scheduled sessions, and PRACTICE features receptions, parties, and plenty of time for unstructured interaction.
