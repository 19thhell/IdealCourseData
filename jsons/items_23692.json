The photo essay below details one student&#39;s reflections on life and culture in the Dominican Republic.   Alone in a crowd: While taking a tour of Santo Domingo,  I noticed a Haitian man walking under the hot sun. He looked troubled. Haitians  have the lowest status in the Dominican Republic and racism is often exhibited  towards them. Trujillo, the dictator, had a long lasting presence of 30 years  and influenced the negative impressions of Haitians on Dominicans. Nevertheless,  there seems to be progress towards individual rights for Haitians, as there  is increasing acceptance of them in prestigious universities like Pontificia  Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra.    The gross happiness product: During a break at an elementary  school we observed, elementary kids posed and were very eager to have their  photos taken when we took out our cameras. They were full of smiles. Dominicans  whether old or young, tend to be very happy. They like to express what they  feel in their hearts, and they convey a lot of love and affection towards  others. This is reflected in the way they speak Spanish. Dominican culture  can be classified as a high-contact culture.    Being closer in mind and space: While walking back from  classes at PUCMM (Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica Madre y Maestra), I observed  a few Dominicans conversing. I noticed that there seems to be quite a difference  between Dominican conversations and American conversations. Dominicans tend  to have long conversations with limited pauses. They tend to be very expressive  when they speak, are a lot physically closer, and convey a lot of affection.  Moreover, they tend to focus on the details of conversations as opposed to  Americans who often like to go straight to the point.    The subject of endless time: Walking up the steps to the  famous market in Santo Domingo where art, crafts, and jewelry are sold, a  vendor sat on the steps selling necklaces in a very relaxed state. The pace  of life in the Dominican Republic is much slower than in other cultures,  and much like in India and Argentina, it is less hectic and more relaxed.  This is related to the culture&#39;s time orientation, which presents time as  being endless rather than dissipating. Focus is thus placed on participation  in events, rather than being at an event. Accordingly, less emphasis is placed  on appointments, schedules and punctuality.    To play while we work: &ldquo;Hello. What&#39;s your name?  Where are you from?&rdquo; Dominicans are curious to get to know others and  converse with people even if they are at work. There does not seem to be  much of a divide between professional behavior and normal social informal  behavior. In American and Western-European culture, there is a large dichotomy  between how one should behave at work and how one should behave with family  and friends. However, in Dominican culture, social life spills over into  work life.                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.

The photo essay below details one student&#39;s reflections on life and culture in the Dominican Republic.   Alone in a crowd: While taking a tour of Santo Domingo,  I noticed a Haitian man walking under the hot sun. He looked troubled. Haitians  have the lowest status in the Dominican Republic and racism is often exhibited  towards them. Trujillo, the dictator, had a long lasting presence of 30 years  and influenced the negative impressions of Haitians on Dominicans. Nevertheless,  there seems to be progress towards individual rights for Haitians, as there  is increasing acceptance of them in prestigious universities like Pontificia  Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra.    The gross happiness product: During a break at an elementary  school we observed, elementary kids posed and were very eager to have their  photos taken when we took out our cameras. They were full of smiles. Dominicans  whether old or young, tend to be very happy. They like to express what they  feel in their hearts, and they convey a lot of love and affection towards  others. This is reflected in the way they speak Spanish. Dominican culture  can be classified as a high-contact culture.    Being closer in mind and space: While walking back from  classes at PUCMM (Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica Madre y Maestra), I observed  a few Dominicans conversing. I noticed that there seems to be quite a difference  between Dominican conversations and American conversations. Dominicans tend  to have long conversations with limited pauses. They tend to be very expressive  when they speak, are a lot physically closer, and convey a lot of affection.  Moreover, they tend to focus on the details of conversations as opposed to  Americans who often like to go straight to the point.    The subject of endless time: Walking up the steps to the  famous market in Santo Domingo where art, crafts, and jewelry are sold, a  vendor sat on the steps selling necklaces in a very relaxed state. The pace  of life in the Dominican Republic is much slower than in other cultures,  and much like in India and Argentina, it is less hectic and more relaxed.  This is related to the culture&#39;s time orientation, which presents time as  being endless rather than dissipating. Focus is thus placed on participation  in events, rather than being at an event. Accordingly, less emphasis is placed  on appointments, schedules and punctuality.    To play while we work: &ldquo;Hello. What&#39;s your name?  Where are you from?&rdquo; Dominicans are curious to get to know others and  converse with people even if they are at work. There does not seem to be  much of a divide between professional behavior and normal social informal  behavior. In American and Western-European culture, there is a large dichotomy  between how one should behave at work and how one should behave with family  and friends.

The photo essay below details one student&#39;s reflections on life and culture in the Dominican Republic.   Alone in a crowd: While taking a tour of Santo Domingo,  I noticed a Haitian man walking under the hot sun. He looked troubled. Haitians  have the lowest status in the Dominican Republic and racism is often exhibited  towards them. Trujillo, the dictator, had a long lasting presence of 30 years  and influenced the negative impressions of Haitians on Dominicans. Nevertheless,  there seems to be progress towards individual rights for Haitians, as there  is increasing acceptance of them in prestigious universities like Pontificia  Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra.    The gross happiness product: During a break at an elementary  school we observed, elementary kids posed and were very eager to have their  photos taken when we took out our cameras. They were full of smiles. Dominicans  whether old or young, tend to be very happy. They like to express what they  feel in their hearts, and they convey a lot of love and affection towards  others. This is reflected in the way they speak Spanish. Dominican culture  can be classified as a high-contact culture.    Being closer in mind and space: While walking back from  classes at PUCMM (Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica Madre y Maestra), I observed  a few Dominicans conversing. I noticed that there seems to be quite a difference  between Dominican conversations and American conversations. Dominicans tend  to have long conversations with limited pauses. They tend to be very expressive  when they speak, are a lot physically closer, and convey a lot of affection.  Moreover, they tend to focus on the details of conversations as opposed to  Americans who often like to go straight to the point.    The subject of endless time: Walking up the steps to the  famous market in Santo Domingo where art, crafts, and jewelry are sold, a  vendor sat on the steps selling necklaces in a very relaxed state. The pace  of life in the Dominican Republic is much slower than in other cultures,  and much like in India and Argentina, it is less hectic and more relaxed.  This is related to the culture&#39;s time orientation, which presents time as  being endless rather than dissipating. Focus is thus placed on participation  in events, rather than being at an event. Accordingly, less emphasis is placed  on appointments, schedules and punctuality.    To play while we work: &ldquo;Hello. What&#39;s your name?  Where are you from?&rdquo; Dominicans are curious to get to know others and  converse with people even if they are at work. There does not seem to be  much of a divide between professional behavior and normal social informal  behavior. In American and Western-European culture, there is a large dichotomy  between how one should behave at work and how one should behave with family  and friends. However, in Dominican culture, social life spills over into  work life.                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.

The photo essay below details one student&#39;s reflections on life and culture in the Dominican Republic.   Alone in a crowd: While taking a tour of Santo Domingo,  I noticed a Haitian man walking under the hot sun. He looked troubled. Haitians  have the lowest status in the Dominican Republic and racism is often exhibited  towards them. Trujillo, the dictator, had a long lasting presence of 30 years  and influenced the negative impressions of Haitians on Dominicans. Nevertheless,  there seems to be progress towards individual rights for Haitians, as there  is increasing acceptance of them in prestigious universities like Pontificia  Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra.    The gross happiness product: During a break at an elementary  school we observed, elementary kids posed and were very eager to have their  photos taken when we took out our cameras. They were full of smiles. Dominicans  whether old or young, tend to be very happy. They like to express what they  feel in their hearts, and they convey a lot of love and affection towards  others. This is reflected in the way they speak Spanish. Dominican culture  can be classified as a high-contact culture.    Being closer in mind and space: While walking back from  classes at PUCMM (Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica Madre y Maestra), I observed  a few Dominicans conversing. I noticed that there seems to be quite a difference  between Dominican conversations and American conversations. Dominicans tend  to have long conversations with limited pauses. They tend to be very expressive  when they speak, are a lot physically closer, and convey a lot of affection.  Moreover, they tend to focus on the details of conversations as opposed to  Americans who often like to go straight to the point.    The subject of endless time: Walking up the steps to the  famous market in Santo Domingo where art, crafts, and jewelry are sold, a  vendor sat on the steps selling necklaces in a very relaxed state. The pace  of life in the Dominican Republic is much slower than in other cultures,  and much like in India and Argentina, it is less hectic and more relaxed.  This is related to the culture&#39;s time orientation, which presents time as  being endless rather than dissipating. Focus is thus placed on participation  in events, rather than being at an event. Accordingly, less emphasis is placed  on appointments, schedules and punctuality.    To play while we work: &ldquo;Hello. What&#39;s your name?  Where are you from?&rdquo; Dominicans are curious to get to know others and  converse with people even if they are at work. There does not seem to be  much of a divide between professional behavior and normal social informal  behavior. In American and Western-European culture, there is a large dichotomy  between how one should behave at work and how one should behave with family  and friends. However, in Dominican culture, social life spills over into  work life.                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.

The photo essay below details one student&#39;s reflections on life and culture in the Dominican Republic.   Alone in a crowd: While taking a tour of Santo Domingo,  I noticed a Haitian man walking under the hot sun. He looked troubled. Haitians  have the lowest status in the Dominican Republic and racism is often exhibited  towards them. Trujillo, the dictator, had a long lasting presence of 30 years  and influenced the negative impressions of Haitians on Dominicans. Nevertheless,  there seems to be progress towards individual rights for Haitians, as there  is increasing acceptance of them in prestigious universities like Pontificia  Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra.    The gross happiness product: During a break at an elementary  school we observed, elementary kids posed and were very eager to have their  photos taken when we took out our cameras. They were full of smiles. Dominicans  whether old or young, tend to be very happy. They like to express what they  feel in their hearts, and they convey a lot of love and affection towards  others. This is reflected in the way they speak Spanish. Dominican culture  can be classified as a high-contact culture.    Being closer in mind and space: While walking back from  classes at PUCMM (Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacute;lica Madre y Maestra), I observed  a few Dominicans conversing. I noticed that there seems to be quite a difference  between Dominican conversations and American conversations. Dominicans tend  to have long conversations with limited pauses. They tend to be very expressive  when they speak, are a lot physically closer, and convey a lot of affection.  Moreover, they tend to focus on the details of conversations as opposed to  Americans who often like to go straight to the point.    The subject of endless time: Walking up the steps to the  famous market in Santo Domingo where art, crafts, and jewelry are sold, a  vendor sat on the steps selling necklaces in a very relaxed state. The pace  of life in the Dominican Republic is much slower than in other cultures,  and much like in India and Argentina, it is less hectic and more relaxed.  This is related to the culture&#39;s time orientation, which presents time as  being endless rather than dissipating. Focus is thus placed on participation  in events, rather than being at an event. Accordingly, less emphasis is placed  on appointments, schedules and punctuality.    To play while we work: &ldquo;Hello. What&#39;s your name?  Where are you from?&rdquo; Dominicans are curious to get to know others and  converse with people even if they are at work. There does not seem to be  much of a divide between professional behavior and normal social informal  behavior. In American and Western-European culture, there is a large dichotomy  between how one should behave at work and how one should behave with family  and friends. However, in Dominican culture, social life spills over into  work life.                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.
