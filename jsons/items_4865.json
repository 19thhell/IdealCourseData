Elective  Courses          Asian  American Literature    SCA-UA  306 Identical  to ENGL-UA 716, COLIT-UA 301. Offered every year. 4 points.    Examines the production of Asian American writing and  literary/cultural criticism up to the present. Focuses on significant factors  affecting the formation of Asian American literature and criticism, such as  changing demographics of Asian American communities and the influence of  ethnic, women's, and gay/lesbian/bisexual studies. Included is a variety of  genres (poetry, plays, fiction and nonfiction, literary/cultural criticism, and  nontraditional forms) by writers from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Explores the  ways in which the writers treat issues such as racial and ethnic identity,  immigration and assimilation, gender, class, sexuality, nationalism, culture  and community, history and memory, and art and political engagement.          History  and Literatures of the South Asian Diaspora    SCA-UA  313 Identical  to ENGL-UA 721, HIST-UA 326. Offered every year. 4 points.    Introduction to the history of the South Asian diaspora  in the United States. Highlights work on South Asian immigrant communities in  the United States and the little-known history of South Asian immigrants on the  east coast of the United States in the context of historical migration to the  United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Offers a multidisciplinary  perspective and uses classic as well as new works on South Asians in the United  States from history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.          Asian/Pacific/American  Popular Culture    SCA-UA  320 4  points.    Examines  the ways in which Asian/Pacific Americans have constituted and positioned their  identities through various mediums of popular culture from the 1930s to the  present. In particular, emphasizes popular institutions of representation,  including music, theatre, fashion, television, and film, to examine the complex  relationship between Asian/Pacific American representational practices and  their material experiences in sociopolitical locations. In addition, considers  the multiple and differentiated interpretive strategies of Asian American  consumers of popular culture. How are Asian/Pacific American consumption and  reception practices constituted differently across lines of class, gender, and  sexuality?          Filming  Asian America: Documenting Community    SCA-UA  361 4  points.    Focuses  specifically on the Asian American communities of New York and their histories.  Presents filmmaking as a mode of community documentation and filmmakers as  historians. Students meet as theorists and field researchers. The first phase  is largely historical and theoretical, while the latter mainly deals with  hands-on filmmaking. Students document various aspects of Asian/Pacific  American communities in New York\u2014sociocultural and political issues surrounding  them, histories, personal stories, geodynamics of ethnic localities, domestic  lives, professions, ethnic festivals and performances, etc. At the end of the course,  students have made at least two collective documentaries (10 to 12 minutes  each), which may be interrelated or on entirely different subjects.          Multiethnic  New York    SCA-UA  363 4  points.    As  a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse  places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from  Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New  York's economic, social, and political landscape. Explores the global  socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and  examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as  they become part of the city.          Asian  Americans &amp; War    SCA-UA  365 4  points.    Examines  Asian American history and contemporary culture using the theme of \"war\" as an  organizing principle. It considers not only the sociopolitical effects of  actual war\u2014between Asian nations, between the United States and Asian nations,  and civil wars in Asia\u2014on immigration to the United States, but also the myriad  meanings of war and their social and cultural implications for Asian Americans.  It examines the ways in which wars have transformed Asian American social  organization and influenced shifting alliances, multiple sense of belonging,  and racial representations in the United States during World War II and Vietnam  as well as the metaphorical presence of war in everyday life.          The  Constitution and People of Color    SCA-UA  366 Offered  every year. 4 points.    Examines  how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the  empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communities from the 19th  century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and  naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the  internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry,  police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course  requirements include attendance at a community function involving  constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final  project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York  City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue.          Reading  Race and Representation    SCA-UA  368 4  points.    Much  contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some  individuals \"have,\" or, even, a \"card\" that some people \"play.\" It is rarely  recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday  experience and knowledge. We ask what it means to \"read\" race in objects,  spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \"about\" race per  se. Addresses a series of such topics, which we consider from an  interdisciplinary perspective, engaging historical and legal texts, literature,  and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history.  Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S.  ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citizenship, rights,  segregation, whiteness, colonialism, labor, migration, and alienness.          \"Chinatown\"  and the American Imagination    SCA-UA  370 Identical  to IDSEM-UG 1229. 4 points.      What  is a \"Chinatown\"? The word alone evokes many images, sounds, smells, and tastes  from many different sensibilities. For recent immigrants, it can be a home away  from home; for \"outsiders,\" an exotic place for cheap eats; for male  action-flick fans, Chow Yun-Fat (or Mark Wahlberg) in The Corruptor; and for  you? (Fill in the blank.) We explore the nooks and crannies of Chinatown in the  American imagination and in its New York real-time, non-virtual existence. How  do we know what we know and do not know? What does Chinatown have to do with  the formation of normative \"American\" identities? What are the possibilities  (and limits) of crossing cultural divides? Class members individually and/or in  groups research, experience, and document a chain of persons, places, and/or  events, creating their own narrative \"tour\" of this place's meanings. Novels,  history books, tourist guides, films, and pop culture supplement the primary  \"text\" of New York's Chinatown. This is a collaborative, discussion-intensive,  field-research-driven class.          The  Immigrant Imagination    SCA-UA  371 4  points.    Examines  contemporary immigration through the lens of visual culture. Explores a variety  of expressive forms produced by migrant subjects\u2014including film, photography,  art, and fashion\u2014and considers how these work to narrate the experiences of  travel and displacement; home and exile; leisure and labor. In doing so,  students consider how these visual representations seek to express the  conditions of contemporary immigration in ways that co-exist with and counter  dominant depictions. We ask: How do visual practices\u2014from filmmaking to  graffitiing\u2014operate within immigrant communities as a mode of story-telling or  world-making? How have immigrants employed visual culture to narrate their  cross-cultural movements, community-building efforts, political struggles, and  cultural memories?          Topics  in A/P/A Studies    SCA-UA  380 Offered  every semester. 4 points.    Specific  topics vary from semester to semester. Former topics have included \"Yellow  Peril\": Documenting and Understanding Xenophobia; Transnational Feminism;  Cultural Politics of Food; and Politics of Fashion in the Asian Diaspora.

The first phase  is largely historical and theoretical, while the latter mainly deals with  hands-on filmmaking. Students document various aspects of Asian/Pacific  American communities in New York\u2014sociocultural and political issues surrounding  them, histories, personal stories, geodynamics of ethnic localities, domestic  lives, professions, ethnic festivals and performances, etc. At the end of the course,  students have made at least two collective documentaries (10 to 12 minutes  each), which may be interrelated or on entirely different subjects.          Multiethnic  New York    SCA-UA  363 4  points.    As  a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse  places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from  Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New  York's economic, social, and political landscape. Explores the global  socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and  examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as  they become part of the city.          Asian  Americans &amp; War    SCA-UA  365 4  points.    Examines  Asian American history and contemporary culture using the theme of \"war\" as an  organizing principle. It considers not only the sociopolitical effects of  actual war\u2014between Asian nations, between the United States and Asian nations,  and civil wars in Asia\u2014on immigration to the United States, but also the myriad  meanings of war and their social and cultural implications for Asian Americans.  It examines the ways in which wars have transformed Asian American social  organization and influenced shifting alliances, multiple sense of belonging,  and racial representations in the United States during World War II and Vietnam  as well as the metaphorical presence of war in everyday life.          The  Constitution and People of Color    SCA-UA  366 Offered  every year. 4 points.    Examines  how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the  empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communities from the 19th  century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and  naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the  internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry,  police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course  requirements include attendance at a community function involving  constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final  project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York  City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue.          Reading  Race and Representation    SCA-UA  368 4  points.    Much  contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some  individuals \"have,\" or, even, a \"card\" that some people \"play.\" It is rarely  recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday  experience and knowledge. We ask what it means to \"read\" race in objects,  spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \"about\" race per  se. Addresses a series of such topics, which we consider from an  interdisciplinary perspective, engaging historical and legal texts, literature,  and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history.  Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S.  ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citizenship, rights,  segregation, whiteness, colonialism, labor, migration, and alienness.          \"Chinatown\"  and the American Imagination    SCA-UA  370 Identical  to IDSEM-UG 1229. 4 points.      What  is a \"Chinatown\"? The word alone evokes many images, sounds, smells, and tastes  from many different sensibilities. For recent immigrants, it can be a home away  from home; for \"outsiders,\" an exotic place for cheap eats; for male  action-flick fans, Chow Yun-Fat (or Mark Wahlberg) in The Corruptor; and for  you? (Fill in the blank.) We explore the nooks and crannies of Chinatown in the  American imagination and in its New York real-time, non-virtual existence. How  do we know what we know and do not know? What does Chinatown have to do with  the formation of normative \"American\" identities? What are the possibilities  (and limits) of crossing cultural divides? Class members individually and/or in  groups research, experience, and document a chain of persons, places, and/or  events, creating their own narrative \"tour\" of this place's meanings. Novels,  history books, tourist guides, films, and pop culture supplement the primary  \"text\" of New York's Chinatown. This is a collaborative, discussion-intensive,  field-research-driven class.          The  Immigrant Imagination    SCA-UA  371 4  points.    Examines  contemporary immigration through the lens of visual culture. Explores a variety  of expressive forms produced by migrant subjects\u2014including film, photography,  art, and fashion\u2014and considers how these work to narrate the experiences of  travel and displacement; home and exile; leisure and labor. In doing so,  students consider how these visual representations seek to express the  conditions of contemporary immigration in ways that co-exist with and counter  dominant depictions. We ask: How do visual practices\u2014from filmmaking to  graffitiing\u2014operate within immigrant communities as a mode of story-telling or  world-making? How have immigrants employed visual culture to narrate their  cross-cultural movements, community-building efforts, political struggles, and  cultural memories?          Topics  in A/P/A Studies    SCA-UA  380 Offered  every semester. 4 points.    Specific  topics vary from semester to semester.
