As is the case with the visual arts, musical Romanticism is difficult to characterize in broad strokes because there are so many ways that the Romantic sensibility manifested itself; in the cases of both art and music, impulses that would be called &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; in literary or philosophical terms can be found in works by composers and artists who had no avowed allegiance to musical or artistic romanticism as self-conscious movements. That said, we can make some general observations about the nineteenth-century musical landscape. First, it is important to realize that as the century progressed, music became increasingly available to&mdash;and popular among&mdash;the middle class. Concert halls provided venues for musical performances, and instrumental music was available to a wide audience. Composers had public audiences for their works, and they also had larger spaces for performance which allowed for &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; music in every sense.     Given these circumstances, the size of the typical orchestra grew, reaching nearly one hundred players. Instruments were introduced to the orchestra for the first time, and others were technically improved. This alone encouraged experimentation with a broad range of timbres, textures, dynamics, tempos, and even pitches. The Romantic preference was for expressive, song-like melodies (often performed rather freely) and harmonic daring. We hear in Romantic music a wide variety of keys within single compositions, often accomplished by rapid MODULATIONS or shifts from key to key, and an increased use of CHROMATIC writing. The latter, which can occur both melodically and harmonically, refers to the incorporation of pitches not normally found within the diatonic scale of a given tonality (the chromatic scale includes all twelve pitches of an octave&mdash;on a keyboard, all the black and white keys&mdash;rather than the seven that comprise any particular key). The use of chromaticism creates a richness in color that was an essential aspect of the Romantic sensibility.     This richness can be seen in the formal variety of Romantic music as well. Nineteenth-century composers developed new genres and, when working with those inherited from the past, often sought to expand them and to make them less rigid and clear in their formal delineation. Thus, we can speak, for example, of a movement as being in a &ldquo;loose&rdquo; or &ldquo;rambling&rdquo; sonata-allegro form, relying on the broad concept of the form, but not adhering to it in every detail. Similarly, Romantic composers tended to steer way from the kinds of definite cadences employed by their Classical predecessors, instead favoring weaker articulations of tonality. In all, there was a tendency to blur categories that perhaps can be seen as analogous to the light, rapid brushstrokes often found in the Romantic paintings of a Delacroix or Gericault.                     Eug&eacute;ne Delacroix: The Death of Sardanapalus (1827)      Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault: The Raft of the &ldquo;Medusa&rdquo; (1818-9)             The piano continued to be an important instrument, and, indeed, it saw technical developments in the first part of the 19th century that rendered it exceptionally suited to expressing the new Romantic sensibility. The piano combined a large range or pitches with a great capacity for dynamic variation and the rapid sounding of many tones simultaneously. Composers gravitated to the piano, writing long,   even MONUMENTAL forms and also MINIATURE pieces, sometimes just long enough to establish a single mood or idea. Short, lyrical piano pieces, such as Chopin&rsquo;s Nocturne in E Flat major , were especially popular and can be understood as instrumental analogues to lieder (vocal songs, normally accompanied on piano), such as the opening piece of Franz    Schubert&rsquo;s Winterreise , Gute Nacht . These miniature forms include many dance forms (like the waltz, the march, and the polka), nocturnes, caprices, ballades, impromptus, and rhapsodies.          The CONCERTO remained an important musical form during the Romantic period, and it can indeed stand as an excellent example of the Romantic tendency to work with inherited forms and explore their potential for formal and textural development. One need only listen to the first movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s Emperor Concerto to hear how expansive the romantic concerto became.        In order to begin to characterize Romanticism in any meaningful way, we must begin by being mindful of the &ldquo;two revolutions,&rdquo; as they have traditionally been called, that so dramatically affected the lives of most Europeans. The first is the Industrial Revolution, while the second refers, not to a single continuous event, but the many political revolutions that so changed the character of the continent. Because of the Industrial Revolution, there developed a kind of nostalgia for a connectedness with nature that characterizes much Romantic art. The Industrial Revolution also meant that cities grew significantly, one consequence of which was a new kind of impersonal existence for many people, which itself had profound cultural and political ramifications. The (reactive) emphasis on the life of the individual and nationalism greatly influenced music in important ways; we see, for example, the development of national musical styles, the increased importance of folk elements in so-called serious music, and an emphasis on the individuality and virtuosity in musical composition and performance.            As is suggested by the association of the term &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; with the remote and even the legendary, Romanticism also gravitated toward what Europeans regarded as the exotic both geographically and temporally. Thus, Richard Wagner&rsquo;s Tristan und Isolde (1859) revisits a medieval legend, part of the appeal of which is its sensuality, as one can hear in the famous Prelude to the opera, which contains the most famous unresolved chord in music history. In instrumental music, Hector Berlioz&rsquo; Symphonie fantastique (1829) deals among other things with a congregation of witches. Indeed, Berlioz describes this movement, &quot;Dream of the Witches' Sabbath&quot; , in his program notes as:       The composer dreams that he is present at a witches' dance, surrounded by horrible spirits, amidst sorcerers and monsters in many fearful forms, who have come to assist at his funeral. Strange sounds, groans, shrill laughter, distant yells, which other cries seem to answer. The beloved melody is heard again but it has lost its noble and shy character; it has become a vulgar, trivial and grotesque dance-tune. She it is, who comes to attend the witches' meeting. Howls of joy greet her arrival . . . . She joins the infernal orgy . . . . Bells toll for the dead, a burlesque parody of the Dies Irae. The witches' round dance. The dance and the Dies Irae are heard at the same time.     Instrumental music also reflects the nationalism of the day; for example, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin is well known for his piano polonaises , a form based on a Polish processional dance. Many Romantic works exhibit nationalistic sentiments; indeed, the tunes of many national anthems date from this period.       Since romantic thinkers took the language and literature of a region as an expression of the land and people themselves, a great deal of music was associated with literature, either directly or indirectly. While the most obvious example is the vast outpouring of romantic operas, the period also saw the rise of the LIED (plural, lieder ), a short art song for solo voice and piano accompaniment. SONG CYCLES , which could be unified either by the music itself or by the texts set to that music, were also popular. Franz Schubert is the composer who is perhaps most closely associated with these two genres; another selection from Winterreise , his most famous song cycle, is Der Lindenbaum . Composers also wrote INCIDENTAL MUSIC intended to accompany production of plays, and PROGRAM MUSIC , which, unlike so-called ABSOLUTE MUSIC , tells a story or sometimes merely suggests an association with something else. For example Beethoven provided each of the five movements of his Sixth Symphony (1808), known as the Pastoral Symphony , with a title suggestive of country life. Another form of program music is the CONCERT OVERTURE , a single-movement work intended to stand alone (unlike an opera overture); they generally exhibit sonata allegro form. An excellent example is Felix Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Overture to A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream . On the other hand, another single-movement orchestral work, the SYMPHONIC POEM or TONE POEM is usually more loosely organized. Some composers even wrote entire symphonies built around a literary theme; an example of these PROGRAM SYMPHONIES is Franz Liszt&rsquo;s Symphony after Goethe&rsquo;s Faust (1857).      Because the Romantic period was so long and it saw the popularization of concert music, the list of important Romantic composers is a long one, as is any selection of significant Romantic works. This discussion of Romantic compositions thus stands as little more than a &ldquo;shorthand&rdquo; indication of the range, breadth, and emotional forcefulness of the monumental output of the Romantic composers."}]}][{"detail": [{"content": "A Short Introduction to Romantic Music                    A Short    Introduction to    Romantic Music               The Romantic period in music, which followed the Classical, begins around 1820 and extends through the remainder of the nineteenth century.

The Industrial Revolution also meant that cities grew significantly, one consequence of which was a new kind of impersonal existence for many people, which itself had profound cultural and political ramifications.

Many Romantic works exhibit nationalistic sentiments; indeed, the tunes of many national anthems date from this period.       Since romantic thinkers took the language and literature of a region as an expression of the land and people themselves, a great deal of music was associated with literature, either directly or indirectly.

{"detail": [{"content": "A Short Introduction to Romantic Music                    A Short    Introduction to    Romantic Music               The Romantic period in music, which followed the Classical, begins around 1820 and extends through the remainder of the nineteenth century. As is the case with the visual arts, musical Romanticism is difficult to characterize in broad strokes because there are so many ways that the Romantic sensibility manifested itself; in the cases of both art and music, impulses that would be called &ldquo;romantic&rdquo; in literary or philosophical terms can be found in works by composers and artists who had no avowed allegiance to musical or artistic romanticism as self-conscious movements. That said, we can make some general observations about the nineteenth-century musical landscape. First, it is important to realize that as the century progressed, music became increasingly available to&mdash;and popular among&mdash;the middle class. Concert halls provided venues for musical performances, and instrumental music was available to a wide audience. Composers had public audiences for their works, and they also had larger spaces for performance which allowed for &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; music in every sense.     Given these circumstances, the size of the typical orchestra grew, reaching nearly one hundred players. Instruments were introduced to the orchestra for the first time, and others were technically improved. This alone encouraged experimentation with a broad range of timbres, textures, dynamics, tempos, and even pitches. The Romantic preference was for expressive, song-like melodies (often performed rather freely) and harmonic daring. We hear in Romantic music a wide variety of keys within single compositions, often accomplished by rapid MODULATIONS or shifts from key to key, and an increased use of CHROMATIC writing. The latter, which can occur both melodically and harmonically, refers to the incorporation of pitches not normally found within the diatonic scale of a given tonality (the chromatic scale includes all twelve pitches of an octave&mdash;on a keyboard, all the black and white keys&mdash;rather than the seven that comprise any particular key). The use of chromaticism creates a richness in color that was an essential aspect of the Romantic sensibility.     This richness can be seen in the formal variety of Romantic music as well. Nineteenth-century composers developed new genres and, when working with those inherited from the past, often sought to expand them and to make them less rigid and clear in their formal delineation. Thus, we can speak, for example, of a movement as being in a &ldquo;loose&rdquo; or &ldquo;rambling&rdquo; sonata-allegro form, relying on the broad concept of the form, but not adhering to it in every detail. Similarly, Romantic composers tended to steer way from the kinds of definite cadences employed by their Classical predecessors, instead favoring weaker articulations of tonality. In all, there was a tendency to blur categories that perhaps can be seen as analogous to the light, rapid brushstrokes often found in the Romantic paintings of a Delacroix or Gericault.                     Eug&eacute;ne Delacroix: The Death of Sardanapalus (1827)      Th&eacute;odore G&eacute;ricault: The Raft of the &ldquo;Medusa&rdquo; (1818-9)             The piano continued to be an important instrument, and, indeed, it saw technical developments in the first part of the 19th century that rendered it exceptionally suited to expressing the new Romantic sensibility. The piano combined a large range or pitches with a great capacity for dynamic variation and the rapid sounding of many tones simultaneously. Composers gravitated to the piano, writing long,   even MONUMENTAL forms and also MINIATURE pieces, sometimes just long enough to establish a single mood or idea. Short, lyrical piano pieces, such as Chopin&rsquo;s Nocturne in E Flat major , were especially popular and can be understood as instrumental analogues to lieder (vocal songs, normally accompanied on piano), such as the opening piece of Franz    Schubert&rsquo;s Winterreise , Gute Nacht . These miniature forms include many dance forms (like the waltz, the march, and the polka), nocturnes, caprices, ballades, impromptus, and rhapsodies.          The CONCERTO remained an important musical form during the Romantic period, and it can indeed stand as an excellent example of the Romantic tendency to work with inherited forms and explore their potential for formal and textural development. One need only listen to the first movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s Emperor Concerto to hear how expansive the romantic concerto became.        In order to begin to characterize Romanticism in any meaningful way, we must begin by being mindful of the &ldquo;two revolutions,&rdquo; as they have traditionally been called, that so dramatically affected the lives of most Europeans. The first is the Industrial Revolution, while the second refers, not to a single continuous event, but the many political revolutions that so changed the character of the continent. Because of the Industrial Revolution, there developed a kind of nostalgia for a connectedness with nature that characterizes much Romantic art. The Industrial Revolution also meant that cities grew significantly, one consequence of which was a new kind of impersonal existence for many people, which itself had profound cultural and political ramifications.
