Information on all children is recorded by the National Data Evaluation Center, in Columbus, Ohio, and is analyzed and reported by the Reading Recovery Project. In addition to providing the districts with the standardized evaluation results and other data related to program implementation, the Reading Recovery Project at New York University publishes the research findings, geared toward the general educational community. The most recent reports available from NYU's Reading Recovery Project's (or online in PDF format), summarize results for Reading Recovery students in New York City and New Jersey for the school year 2007-2008. The reported results demonstrate that:       1. NYU-affiliated districts provide quality instruction and efficient implementation of Reading Recovery, as evidenced by a high proportion of at-risk students who successfully complete the program. 2. Reading Recovery children catch up with their peers scoring within the classroom average on various literacy measures, and being able to read texts of appropriate level of difficulty (using an Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement, Clay (2002).          3. Reading Recovery is cost effective, as it reduces rates of retention, or referral and placement to special education for Reading Recovery children, when compared to other at-risk students.    4. Reading Recovery children maintain their literacy gains beyond the first grade, and achieve similar results on standardized tests as their classroom peers.       The New York City and New Jersey reports corroborate earlier research which demonstrates that Reading Recovery has a substantial positive impact on children's literacy development. Reviews of Reading Recovery research by Pinnell (1995) and by Askew et al. (1998) provide excellent sources for research findings on various aspects of the program such as teaching and learning, teacher development, program implementation, as well as comprehensive evidence on program success and cost-effectiveness, culled from the extensive body of state-wide and international research spanning the last three decades.    Researchers with the Reading Recovery Project have also explored some important aspects of program implementation. Ashdown and Simic (1998) reported on the link between daily delivery of Reading Recovery lessons and success in reading, emphasizing the intensive nature of Reading Recovery instruction as a key to accelerated learning. Ashdown and Simic (1999) have also reported data from a large sample of students in the metropolitan area, which suggest that Reading Recovery also provides an appropriate solution to reading problems for students whose native language is not English. Currently in preparation are studies focusing on cost-effectiveness, and on factors influencing program effectiveness in diverse settings.

We are proud to be continuing this important tradition in service to our local New York City community as the NYU Clinical Literacy Practicum.    We see first grade children through high school adolescents. Our clients may need intensive tutoring in reading and writing skills or they may be students who just need a little additional help. We focus on word recognition skills (including decoding using phonics), reading and writing fluency, vocabulary development, and comprehension.    All tutors are completing their master's degrees in Literacy Education. Tutoring generally begins with an assessment of the child&rsquo;s reading abilities. Informal and formal measures may focus on such areas as oral reading, word recognition, reading comprehension, spelling, composition, vocabulary, and other related areas. Using the assessment data as a basis, an individual tutoring plan targeted to the child&rsquo;s needs, is developed. Tutoring is conducted either one-on-one or within a small group. The tutoring sessions are scheduled in alignment with the university calendar and are typically offered during the spring and summer semesters. The application period for the spring semester is November 15-December 31. The application period for the July tutoring sessions is April 15-May 31.    Download the clinic brochure for more information on the Literacy Clinic and the services we provide. For the application process to be considered complete, the child's parent and teacher must each submit the electronic application found in the menu bar on this page. Candidates are selected based on a variety of factors including highest need, date of application submission, and availability of tutors.
