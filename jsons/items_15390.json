The seminar will analyze how recent scholarship challenges established models and insights, and it will look to emerging areas of synthesis and narrative consensus. The seminar will also examine how the rich scholarship on the Cold War sheds light on current international issues, and what lessons historians might offer to policy-makers.

February 10, 2015: &quot;Temporality and Representation in the Heritage Constructions of Qatar&quot; (Trinidad Rico, Texas A&amp;M-Qatar)            Abstract   This discussion explores the role of chronology in constructions of the heritage fabric of Doha. Transformations in the landscapes of Qatar are subjected to intense bouts of modernization, a process that asks that inhabitants live in the present with a future-oriented gaze. The timeline of this capital city is marked by festivals and commemorations, constructions and reconstructions, destructions and inventions that navigate rapid change, emphasizing the centrality of the present in heritage perceptions and depictions.   The present in Doha takes particular significance in a constantly-shifting landscape that gives rise to interrupted lifestyles, relocated points of reference, and a blurred understanding of what is \u2018new\u2019 and \u2018old\u2019 in the heritage discourse. This discussion documents recent manifestations of this discourse particularly in urban, archaeological and cultural landscapes, with reference to global chronological points of reference and local legal instruments.    Bio   Dr Trinidad Rico is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar. She holds a PhD in Anthropology from Stanford University, an MA in Principles of Conservation from UCL and a BA in Archaeology from the University of Cambridge.   Her current research focuses on the mobilisation of Islamic values in constructions of heritage, and she is co-author of the volume \u2018Cultural Heritage in the Arabian Peninsula: Debates, Discourses and Practices\u2019 (Ashgate, 2013).                                 February 11, 2015: Research Seminar, &quot;Choreographing the Historical Imagination: Archival Mobilizations&quot; (Trajal Harrell, New York)            Abstract:   This talk confronts the history, construction, and interpretation of contemporary dance. Starting from the premise that history is always partly a fiction, Harrell works with historical imagination as a way to rethink how to process and interpret our pasts.   While working on Twenty Looks or Paris Is Burning at The Judson Church, which is an exploration of a hypothetical hybrid movement drawing both from postmodern dance and voguing, Harrell began investigating the history of butoh, a dance form created in part to resist the conservatism permeating postwar Japanese choreography. As Harrell learned more, the project transformed, focusing on the life and work of Japanese choreographer Tatsumi Hijikata (1928\u201386), a butoh pioneer. Hijikata situated butoh as an outlaw, literary, and surrealist dance form, activating themes of death, criminality, abjection, and corporeality. Harrell\u2019s extended research into the Hijikata archives culminated in Used Abused and Hung Out to Dry, which was commissioned by MoMA as part of Performing Histories: Live Artworks Examining the Past, in connection with the exhibition Tokyo: The New Avant-Garde 1945\u20131970, and was performed in The Agnes Gund Garden Lobby in 2012.   In conversation with NYUAD Assistant Professor of Theater Debra Levine and colleagues from History and other disciplines, Harrell will discuss the value of historical archives of performance for contemporary artists, and the research methodologies he has developed to engage with the historical materials and rich media stored in the Tatsumi Hijikata Archive at the Keio University Arts Center in Tokyo.   Bio:  Trajal Harrell has been a recipient of fellowships from The Saison Foundation, The Guggenheim Foundation, Art Matters Foundation, Foundation for Contemporary Arts, and the Doris Duke Foundation. He is perhaps best known for a series of works entitled Twenty Looks or Paris is Burning at The Judson Church which re-imagine a meeting between early postmodern dance and the voguing dance tradition and created in seven sizes. Antigone Sr., the large in the series, won the 2012 Bessie Award for Best Production. In Fall 2012, he premiered the last work in that series, Judson Church is Ringing in Harlem (Made-to-Measure)/Twenty Looks or Paris is Burning at The Judson Church (M2M), with the distinction of being the first dance commission of MoMA PS1.   Most recently, he created the first of a new body of work examining butoh dance from the theoretical praxis of voguing. This latest work, Used Abused and Hung Out to Dry, premiered at The Museum of Modern Art- MoMA in February 2013, where he has begun a two-year residency further developing this new body of work.   Harrell's work has been presented In New York and the U.S. at many venues including Crossing the Line Festival, The Kitchen, New York Live Arts, TBA Festival- Portland, Walker Arts Center-Minneapolis, American Realness Festival, ICA Boston, Danspace Project, DTW, P.S. 122, Cornell University, Colorado College, Philadelphia Live Arts and Los Angeles\u2019 RedCat Theater. His work has been presented internationally at festivals such as Festival d\u2019Automne (Paris), Rencontres Chor\u00e9graphiques (Paris), Festival d\u2019Avignon, Impulstanz (Vienna), TanzimAugust (Berlin), Panorama Festival (Rio de Janeiro), Festival Transmeriques (Montreal), and Holland Festival, among others.   He has also shown performance work in visual art contexts such as MoMA, MoMA PS1, Perfoma Biennial, Fondation Cartier (Paris), The New Museum (NYC), The Margulies Art Warehouse (Miami), The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Serralves Museum (Porto), Centre Pompidou- Metz, Centre Pompidou-Paris, ICA Boston and Art Basel-Miami Beach.

February 24, 2015: \u201c&#39;An African Village in the Hijaz&#39;: Slavery, Agriculture, and Malaria in Traditional Arabia&quot; (Benjamin Reilly, Carnegie Mellon-Qatar)            Abstract   In the 19th and early 20th centuries, European travelers were astounded to find entire villages of African farmers located in the midst of the Arabian Peninsula. These African agriculturalists, who were a mixture of slaves and freedmen, were found throughout Arabian Peninsula, especially in Najd and the Hijaz.   In contrast to earlier authors who have explained African slavery in terms of Arab laziness, I will argue that a better explanation lies in the geography and genetics of the Arabian Peninsula itself. African agricultural slavery in Arabia was driven by the highly malarial character of the Arabian Peninsula\u2019s arable landscapes, which tended to be moist wadi beds and other drainage basins.   Rather than exploit these unhealthy landscapes directly, Arabian townsmen employed African laborers endowed with innate and acquired resistance to malaria as proxy farmers. As a result, agricultural slavery in the Arabian Peninsula had surprising parallels to slave practices in the 17th-19th century Caribbean, where slaves were similarly employed in hot, humid lowlands in large part due to their intrinsic resistance malaria and yellow fever.      Bio   Benjamin Reilly is an Associate Teaching Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, where he has served since 2004. Although his doctoral work, which was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh, examined the political and intellectual history of the French Revolution, he has published several books on environmental history over the years, and is now expanding his studies to the Arabian Peninsula, which remains terra incognita from the standpoint of environmental history.   To this end, Reilly has recently published several papers describing the impact of lactase persistence on Arabia\u2019s Bedouin populations, as well as the geographic and genetic underpinnings of Arabian Peninsula slavery. His forthcoming book with Ohio University Press, which will form the basis of his talk, examines the previously unstudied phenomenon of African agricultural slavery within the traditional Arabian Peninsula.                                 March 17, 2015: Research Seminar, &quot;Between China, Iran, and Byzantium: The T\u00fcrks in Inner Asia from the 6th to the 8th Century\u201d (S\u00f6ren Stark, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University)            Abstract :  The \u2018World Empire\u2019 of the nomadic T\u00fcrks, arising from the Inner Asian steppes around the middle of the 6th century and spanning, during its apogee some 30 years later, from Crimea to the Hindukush and to Manchuria, remains one of the least known hegemonic polities in the history of Eurasia. In popular perception it is largely overshadowed by the later Chinggisid&amp;nbsp; \u2018World Empire,\u2019 although the Mongols owed much of their imperial ideology and structures of governance to the T\u00fcrks.  Like the Pax Mongolica some 700 years later, the unification of large parts of Eurasia under T\u00fcrk rule considerably intensified diplomatic, economic and cultural exchange across the Eurasian continent (\u201cSilk Roads\u201d). In this context much attention has been given to the role of Sogdian merchants. Instead, my presentation will shift the focus to the nomadic elites of the T\u00fcrks as agents of cultural communication, transmission, and appropriation in a framework of shared political culture and interstate competition \u2014 between China, the Iranian world, and Byzantium. In particular, I will inquire how the T\u00fcrks\u2019 active participation in this exchange network and their competition with other imperial \u2018players\u2019 of their time impacted upon and shaped their own self-representation.     Bio :  S\u00f6ren Stark is Assistant Professor of Central Asian Art and Archaeology at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. He specializes in the political and cultural interrelations between pastoral nomads in Central and Inner Asia and their sedentary neighbors, with a monograph on the archaeology and history of the T\u00fcrks in Central and Inner Asia (published in 2008 as Die Altt\u00fcrkenzeit in Mittel- und Zentralasien. Arch\u00e4ologische und historische Studien, Nomaden und Sesshafte 6. Wiesbaden: Ludwig-Reichert-Verlag) and a major exhibition in New York and Washington on the culture of Early Iron Age nomads on the territory of present-day Kazakhstan (see the catalogue Nomads and Networks.

He is currently leading an archaeological field-project on territorial fortifications in 4th to 8th century CE Bukhara (Uzbekistan). He is also (together with F. Kidd) co-editor of a Handbook of Central Asian Archaeology and Art now in preparation at Oxford University Press.                                 April 7, 2015: &quot;Does Protest Have No Borders? Approaching Global History through Marches and Street Demonstrations&quot; (Philipp Gassert, University of Mannheim)            Abstract:   Protest marches have been around for several centuries. As a means of expressing dissent they share certain basic features across time and space. The modern street rally emerged during the revolutionary upheavals of the 18th and 19th century. It was later adapted to the needs of labor unions in industrializing societies. It also became a very prominent feature in the decolonization struggles exemplified by the Ghandian marches in South Africa and India, which gained influence on protest movements in other countries as well.   Marches were also an integral part of manufacturing consent in 20th century Communist and Fascist regimes. They remained the protest means of choice when the new social movements of the 1960s and 1970s arrived. Despite the successive media revolutions of the past century, street demonstrations do not seem to have lost their usefulness today. Because of their (almost) universal nature and surprising resilience with regard to historical change, protest marches lend themselves to the study of transnational interactions and cross-cultural comparisons. They also help us to understand how the grammar of protest has evolved from 1800 to the present. This paper seeks to explore the question to what extent a fresh look at street demonstrations can help us in writing global histories on a large historical scale.

April 21, 2015: &quot;Universal Progress vs. Local Culture: Soviet Social Science and the Problems of Development in Soviet Central Asia&quot; (Artemy Kalinovsky, University of Amsterdam)            Abstract:   By the 1970s, Soviet planners were fretting that the industrialization of Central Asia launched in the 1950s was failing to bring the desired dividends to the Soviet economy or the local population. Locals tended to avoid the industrial work force and seemed to shy away from educational opportunities, while agriculture remained labor intensive and resistant to mechanization. Economists, sociologists, and demographers tried to make sense of this situation and offer policy advice. In the process, they discovered the limits of their own fields and sought out new approaches to better understand the micro-processes inhibiting modernization.   Examining the academic debates and bureaucratic struggles of these scholars will shed light on the interaction between government and scholarship under late socialism and the parallels between development thought there and in the west. It will also help us contextualize and historicize current debates about development in Central Asia.     Bio:   Artemy Kalinovsky is an Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam.

His current research, supported by a Veni grant from the Dutch Science Organization (NWO), is focused on the politics and practices of modernization in Soviet Tajikistan.                                 TBD: &quot;Empire&#39;s Progeny: A Comparative Perspective on Gender, Race and Citizenship in Colonial Asia&quot; (Frances Gouda, Bowdoin College)            Abstract   In the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, and British India the issues of gender and interracial sexuality produced divergent policy outcomes in terms of racial classifications and the prerogatives of belonging to the European community and citizenship.    In this seminar, Frances Gouda will analyze these differences in a comparative manner in order to shed light on the distinctive patterns of governance in three colonial societies in South and Southeast Asia during the heydays of European colonial culture from the later nineteenth century to 1942.

While much MENA history from below has been written under the sign of various forms of structural determinism \u2013 usually linked to the development of modern capitalism (Abrahamian; Batatu; Beinin and Lockman; Burke; Halliday; Hanna; Von Sivers) \u2013 the premise of this paper is that historians of contentious politics need to probe the possibilities and forms of creative and transgressive agency in the making of movements that mobilise to challenge multiply-determined and intersectional forms of power, subordination and \u2018instituted heteronomy\u2019 (van der Linden; Castoriadis).   To study the cross-border diffusion and appropriation of models for collective action is to contribute to the understanding of how sites of unruly collective agency are constructed and how intersectional leverage against power is acquired. This paper draws attention to how models for collective action can be \u2018pirated\u2019 (Anderson) \u2013 that is appropriated across contexts that are very different in political, economic and social terms. This form of appropriation (piracy) is not solely the fruit of long sociological preparation, or socioeconomic development, but can operate in the political field in ways that generate dynamics that are socioeconomically consequential. In other words, to study \u2018piracy\u2019 is to point to a site of change within the social order that is not simply an epiphenomena of an entirely pre-existing, structural, socioeconomic process (modernization, capitalism, or globalisation).   The paper \u2013 building on works by Khalili, Khuri-Makdisi and Lockman \u2013 examines the cross-border social life of contentious mobilising discourses \u2013 considering (1) nineteenth century popular heterodoxy, Islamic revivalism and millenarianism (2) late nineteenth century and inter-war period liberalism, Islamic modernism, and patriotism (3) post-1945 national liberation, Arab socialism, and Third Worldism, and (4) late twentieth and early twenty-first century Islamism and people power. The paper will track some of the ways in which these mobilising discourses were appropriated across borders, and how they acted to shape and coordinate the popular movements of different periods.

November 11, 2014: &quot;Competitive Emulation and the &#39;Official Mind&#39; in the Russian Conquest of Central Asia&quot; (Alexander Morrison, Nazarbayev University, Astana)            Abstract   The Russian conquest of Central Asia is usually understood either as an incidental outcome of the 'Great Game' between Britain and Russia for control of the region, or else as driven by economic considerations, principally the need of the Russian textile industry for secure markets and raw cotton.   Both of these explanations are unsatisfactory: the first because it simply reflects British preoccupations with the defence of India and largely ignores Central Asian actors; the second because it is a product of Soviet dogma (the 'Hobson-Lenin thesis') and entirely unsupported by evidence.   Using materials from archives in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia and India, this talk reveals a more complex story, one in which the British are less important, and the focus is on relations between the Russian empire, the Kazakh steppe nomads who were its nearest neighbours, and the Central Asian states of Bukhara, Khiva and Kokand. It will illuminate how the conquest of Central Asia was a very effective projection of Russian power, one that was increasingly celebrated after the Crimean War cast doubts on Russia's ability to maintain the status, the expected forms of behaviour, and the military and political repertoire, of an imperial \u2018Great Power\u2019.

Prior to the rebellions, Chinese Muslims in Gansu province served as informal local brokers between Qing field officials and indigenous Tibetans and Mongols in the borderlands. For instance, they served as yamen clerks and runners, using their knowledge of Tibetan and Mongolian to gather taxes and information on behalf of the state. As the proprietors of &quot;resthouses&quot; (xiejia \u6b47\u5bb6) they also facilitated trade across the Sino-Tibetan frontier.   In the aftermath of the rebellions, these roles were formally recognized and given a sound legal footing in Qing administrative practice. Thus, paradoxically, former rebels were incorporated into the Qing colonial administration as local gentry. In this new role, Muslims acquired new positions as civil and military officials. Muslim traders and colonists were permitted to move &quot;beyond the passes&quot; into Tibetan territory and even acquired status as &quot;village elders&quot; in Tibetan communities. Thus in the legal arenas of the local government court (the yamen), it was Muslims who increasingly represented Tibetans before the magistrate and were otherwise charged with resolving conflicts both among Tibetans and between Tibetans and the state.   The impact of the gentrification of Muslims in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands was profound: Muslim gentry increasingly displaced Tibetan and Mongolian nobility, both lay and ecclesiastic, as the main interlocutors between the Qing court and Tibetan Buddhists. From the 1870s through the early 1900s, Tibetan Buddhist elites went from being &quot;allies&quot; to &quot;indigenes&quot; in the eyes of the court. The &quot;aboriginalization&quot; of Tibetans paralleled the emergence of the Hui as the key strategic partner in the governance of Inner Asia. The discovery of the Muslims during the late Qing led to a significant new role for Chinese Muslims in the national politics of the late Qing empire.   Bio   Max Oidtmann is a historian of early modern China and Inner Asia (1600s through present). He received his PhD from Harvard University in History and East Asian Languages in 2014 and is currently working on two book projects.

Drawing on archival documents of the KUTV Arabic Section and the students\u2019 personal files, it will show how students positioned themselves as temporary \u201cStalinist subjects,\u201d as \u201cforeigners,\u201d and as \u201cEasterners\u201d to achieve particular political and personal goals.   The talk will also consider cases of students\u2019 extreme deviations from party discipline in order to pursue political objectives or interests that often lay outside Soviet territorial and political boundaries. These examples of radical unbelief and wholesale rejections of the regime and its universal precepts offer a useful starting point for understanding the limits of belonging as defined by various actors in the Moscow-coordinated international communist project.

This lecture is about that transformative moment, as wartime imperatives gave way to postwar reconstruction, and the United States assumed the mantle of victor as well as cultural redeemer.   In this context, American Studies abroad has a surprising history, intertwined with the restoration or invention of a European community. This is illustrated most dramatically at the the Salzburg Seminar in American Civilization, founded in 1947 with the very tenuous approval of American occupation authorities.   In a bomb-damaged baroque castle, scholars, novelists and poets carried the American word abroad, while displaced persons, former Nazis and budding communists met on the supposedly neutral ground of American culture. This institution leads us to reconsider cultural diplomacy in the early Cold War, and to a more cosmopolitan history of \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d   Bio:      George Blaustein is assistant professor of American Studies and history at the University of Amsterdam.

Irfan Habib, National University of Educational Planning and Education, New Delhi)            Abstract:       The main focus of this lecture revolves around questioning the idea of &quot;Islamic science&quot; as proposed by several scholars in Euro-American universities and elsewhere. There is a modest attempt to question the possibility of Islamic science as a distinct epistemological category, which is being pushed by some Islamic scholars since the late seventies. I do not see Islamic science and modern science as binaries.   Modern science has a cross-civilizational character and its Eurocentricity needs to be questioned and exposed. However, it cannot be replaced by another centrism, being proposed by the Islamists, as it will be equally undemocratic.   I use the modernist Muslim reformers of the 19th century India and their pluralist perspective to question the essentialist and myopic interpretations of some of the present day Islamic interlocutors. The expressions Jihad (to struggle) and Ijtihad (independent thinking or use of reason) are not just provocatively used in the title, they are central to the arguments put forth here. Both jihad and ijtihad had been the core of Islam, unfortunately the former is the most misinterpreted and misunderstood while the latter is completely forgotten.      Bio:        S Irfan Habib has worked in the area of history of science as well as political history. After teaching history for a few years, he joined the National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies, New Delhi.   He spent more than thirty years looking at the intellectual and institutional foundations of modern science and technology during the colonial phase in India. Within this framework, he began investigating the role of dissemination of modern science through the local Indian languages, and how a language like Urdu, could transform itself from a language of poetry to a language skilled in communicating modern science. He later moved to the questions of interface between local Indian knowledge traditions and modern knowledge which came along with colonization.   Besides a large number of papers, he has also edited and authored several books including Situating the History of Science: Dialogues with Joseph Needham and Social History of Social History of Science in Colonial India (both edited with D Raina). He has also co-authored Domesticating Modern Science in Colonial India . His book To Make the Deaf Hear: Ideology and Programme of Bhagat Singh and his Comrades , has been translated into several Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali.   His latest book is Jihad or Ijtihad: Religious Orthodoxy and Modern Science in Contemporary Islam . He has also coordinated the South and South East Asian section of history of science in UNESCO\u2019s prestigious History of Humanity series. At present he holds Maulana Azad Chair at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration, New Delhi.

April 8, 2014: &quot;Reflections on 1591 and 2013 in Songhay and Mali&quot; (Lansine Kaba, Carnegie Mellon University, Qatar)            Abstract:   The battle of Tondibi fought on the 12th of April 1591, and the French jet-and helicopter gunship intervention initiated on the 11th of January 2013 in Bamako, Mali, bespeak some of the tragedy that the land known in African Islamic historiography as the Western Sudan witnessed in its pre-colonial and post-colonial history. They were true fatidic events.   The Muslim Askiya dynasty of Gao that ruled the Songhay Empire, situated in the Middle Niger River valley and controlling a significant part of the Sahel and the Sahara between 1464 and 1591, precipitously collapsed under the blows received from the fire arms-equipped invading forces dispatched from Morocco by the Sultan Mulay Ahmed al-Mansur to boost his kingdom\u2019s position in the gold trade (see L. Kaba, \u201cArchers, Musketeers and Mosquitoes,\u201d Journal of African History, 22, 4, 1981; \u201cThe Pen, the Sword and the Crown,\u201d JAH, 1984).   In January 2013, an analogous blow was struck against the democratically-elected regime of Mali, when it was hit first by an invasion of its northern region by Touareg separatists and Arab Islamist insurgents, and then by a junior officers-led coup orchestrated in protest against the government\u2019 s inaction.   The Sahel zone has turned into a volatile region in which Islamic fundamentalism, Touareg and Black African nationalisms compete for power. With the crisis that shook in 2011 the authoritarian North African regimes, Muammar Qaddafi\u2013recruited Touareg fighters returned home to northern Mali, flush with resources and political determination. They launched a rebellion for the liberation of their region from black African rule.   While secularist, the insurgents entered in alliance of convenience \u2013that was short lived-- with the militant mostly Algerian Islamist groups long active in Mali\u2019s north. Together they set on introducing the Sharia law upon their conquest of Mali\u2019s northern garrisons and cities, including the old center of Islamic learning and trade, Timbuktu. These events triggered the coup in Bamako. A few weeks later, the jihadists advanced toward the south, thereby threatening the whole region and the Western Mediterranean with a militant Islamic state, probably a new kind of Afghanistan, according to some reporters.   France President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande decided to intervene against the Islamists, while in New York the international community was mulling an appropriate answer to the threat. French soldiers and President Hollande received a jubilant welcome in Timbuktu and other Malian cities, with the Tricolor hovering over the mosques. Does the intervention herald a new form of colonialism or a new resolve to fight Jihadism?   Still unsettled, the matter invites historians to reconsider the long history of Islam in West Africa as well as the general issues of politics in the area, including nation building (and failing), ethnicity and terrorism, French-African relations and the current global politics. I will discuss the subject in the tradition of la longue dur\u00e9e that some recent works have inappropriately considered.   Bio:   Lansin\u00e9 Kaba, Distinguished Visiting Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, has widely published in English and French on Islam in West Africa, French and British decolonization, and African post-colonial one-party states. His monograph, &quot;The Wahhabiyya, Islamic Reform and Politics,&quot; (Northwestern University Press, 1974) was the co-winner of the 1975 Melville Herskovits Award for the outstanding book of the year given by the African Studies Association.   Kaba received the 1978 Distinguished Teacher Award at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, was President of the African Studies Association, 1998-2001, and Dean of the Honors College at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 1996-2004. He has authored numerous significant articles on the rise, efflorescence and fall of the Songhay Empire, with a major emphasis on its Islamic dimension and place in the 16th-century emerging global affairs.

He is best known for his implication in the assassination of M.K. Gandhi.   Savarkar\u2019s prose has been dissected for its fascist under and overtones, his political career has been examined as the foundation for \u201cHindu fundamentalism\u201d, and of all the figures who populate the history of Indian nationalism he is by far the most hateful and therefore the one most reviled.     Yet, what remains to be examined is his most intellectually rigorous work of which he was most proud and with which he most identified, namely, his poetry. Difficult to understand because of the mixture of modern and archaic Marathi and Sanskrit that he used, it was the medium to which he turned to express the gamut of his emotional and political life. As such it is a crucial archive.   In his ballads we see the genre used to both teach the bare facts of history and awaken a slumbering masculine community into action. In this seminar, I will address how one might expand the boundaries of Indian intellectual history by taking seriously Savarkar\u2019s poetry as the archive of a popular conception of history at a cusp moment at the turn of the 20th century.

Her first book was Two Men and Music: Nationalism, Colonialism and the Making of an Indian Classical Tradition (Oxford University Press, 2005), and she is now at work on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, known as the chief ideologue of Hindu fundamentalism.                                                       April 29, 2014: &quot;Women\u2019s Groups in East Germany \u2013 Knitting Groups, Feminists, Troublemakers?&quot; (Susanne Kranz, Zayed University, Dubai)            Abstract:   This talk explores the autonomous women\u2019s group Frauen f\u00fcr den Frieden (Women for Peace) that was founded in 1982 in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), a state that, in 1972, had officially declared gender equality as achieved, making all women\u2019s groups redundant. It investigates the reasons behind the foundation of the group as well as its functioning and its rather quick decline.   One reason for the establishment of an autonomous women\u2019s group was the ratification of a new military law that specified the draft of women into the military service in case of a national emergency. Opinions and views about ideology, religion and politics represented minor matters within the group yet they played a decisive role in the weakening of the group which was further facilitated by the infiltration of the organization by the Stasi.   The talk offers new insights into an important oppositional group challenging the state\u2019s power that was established as a women\u2019s organization without explicit women\u2019s issues on their agenda.

May 13, 2014: &quot;The Greek War of Independence and the Birth of the Clash of Civilizations Theory, 1821-1830&quot; (Karine Walther, School of Foreign Service in Qatar, Georgetown University)            Abstract:     Despite his claims to originality, the logical underpinnings of Samuel Huntington\u2019s theory of a &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot; were embedded in the national identity of the United States as a young republic and played an influential role in shaping its relations with the wider world. This talk focuses on one specific moment in diplomatic history to illustrate the power of these \u201ccivilizational\u201d designations in shaping American foreign policy discourse in the early nineteenth century: the American response to the Greek War for Independence.   Coming forty-five years after its own independence and twenty-five years after the Barbary Wars, Americans stood at rapt attention as they witnessed what they understood as a Christian nation fighting for democracy and freedom from its Muslim oppressors. Between 1821 and 1828, thousands of Americans, led by religious organizations, philhellenes, journalists, academics, and political leaders, came together to urge the US government to act on behalf of the Greeks.   Although intervention posed no pragmatic or economic advantages to the United States, many Americans nonetheless lobbied for official involvement and privately organized to aid the Greeks.The discourse that emerged around these efforts revealed the importance of ideological, religious and cultural motivations in shaping American attitudes towards foreign policy.   This talk demonstrates that the rhetoric of intervention brought together civilizational categories that merged religious identity, enlightenment thought, and modernity with the mythos of Ancient Greece as the birthplace of Western Enlightenment thought, echoing Huntington\u2019s later arguments about a so-called \u201cclash\u201d between Islam and the West.

She holds a PhD in history from Columbia University, a Ma\u00eetrise and Licence in sociology from the University of Paris VIII and a BA in American studies from the University of Texas, Austin. She is currently working on a manuscript entitled &quot;Sacred Interests: Islam and U.S. Foreign Policy, 1821-1921,&quot; which focuses on how ideas about Islam influenced American foreign relations between the Greek War of Independence and the end of WWI.

They weren\u2019t. Having earlier seized control of the vessel and slaughtered most of the crew, they were staging an elaborate ruse, acting as if they were humble servants. When Delano, an idealistic, anti-slavery republican, finally realized the deception, he responded with explosive violence.   Drawing on research on four continents, the talk explores the multiple forces that culminated in this extraordinary event\u2014an event that already inspired Herman Melville\u2019s masterpiece Benito Cereno. Through the lens of the dramatic happenings of that day, the talk will map a new transnational history of freedom and slavery in the Americas, capturing the clash of peoples, economies, and faiths that was the New World in the early 1800s.

It offers portrait of America in the early 1950s, using the widespread panic over polio to shed light on national obsessions and fears. Drawing on newly available papers of Jonas Salk, Albert Sabin and other key players, it paints a portrait of the race for the cure, weaving a dramatic tale centered on the furious rivalry between Salk and Sabin.     As backdrop to these competitive research endeavors, the talk will also explore the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was founded in the 1930s by FDR and Basil O'Connor. The National Foundation revolutionized fundraising and the perception of disease in America, using &quot;poster children&quot; and the famous March of Dimes to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from a vast army of contributors (instead of a few well-heeled benefactors), creating the largest research and rehabilitation network in the history of medicine.

October 1, 2013: &quot;An Explosion of the Political: Revisiting the Meerut Conspiracy Case in Colonial India&quot; (Manu Goswami, NYU)            Abstract:   The talk is based on a larger project on colonial internationalisms in the interwar era. It centers on the stakes and significance of an infamous legal trial in late colonial India, the Meerut Conspiracy Case, brought against Indian and British trade-union leaders, communists, socialists, and workers in the late-1920s and early 1930s. The trial stands out not only for its overt procedural violations of a much heralded colonial liberal order. It significance lie not only in the fact that it was the first criminal trial that prosecuted British and Indian subjects as juridically equal, abrogating a long-standing 'rule of colonial difference'. It was the first juridical reckoning by British imperial authorities with communism as an idea and movement, anticipating later cold-war era anti-communist discourse. By treating the depositions as an example and source of an intellectual history in extremis, the talk emphasizes the novelty and heterogeneity of early communism.

October 29, 2013: &quot;Why is the UAE a Federation?&quot; (Frauke Heard-Bey, Abu Dhabi)            Abstract:   Over centuries the role of religion prohibited the area\u2019s integration into \u2018Ibadhi Oman. Tribal allegiances at times promoted at other times inhibited the formation of a larger political unit on the territory of the modern UAE. The exploitation of geographically-conditioned diverse economic resources re-enforced the tribal differences. However, it was the nature of the engagement of the various coastal tribal chiefs with an outside power, the British in India, which laid the foundations for the UAE\u2019s federal political system.

However, its port cities have played a major role both as maritime routes and in the imaginery and representation of space, as it is attested in early modern maps.   This presentation will deal with Africa in the cartographic imagination of the early modern period and will refer also to theoretical aspects of the role of Africa in global history.                                 December 3, 2013: \u201cTerror, Law, and the Conquest of Western Germany during the French Revolutionary Wars&quot; (Edward Kolla, School of Foreign Service in Qatar, Georgetown University)                 Abstract:   The period 1793-94 saw the French Revolution at its most radical, and the Revolutionary Wars at their most violent. French officials developed a new justification for territorial conquest by which France could claim \u201cjust indemnities\u201d for its efforts fighting tyranny and to improve its strategic position as the defender of the rights of man.     Although many accused France of chauvinistic expansion when it annexed the left bank of the Rhine, this was therefore anything but a return the ancien r\u00e9gime legal status quo. It was, rather, a unique synthesis in international law of a devotion to popular government, republican ideology, and France's geostrategic interests.   Bio:   Edward Kolla is an Assistant Professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in Qatar. He specializes in European political, diplomatic, cultural, and legal history. He is currently preparing a book manuscript on the impact and effect of the French Revolution on international law, specifically tracing the emergence of popular sovereignty as a justification for claims to territory.                                 December 15, 2013: &quot;Civilizations, Empires and World Order during the Long 19th Century, 1750-1924: A Peculiar Muslim Experience?&quot; (Cemil Aydin, UNC)            Abstract:   The political experiences of many Muslims societies during the long 19th century societies do not reflect any simple grand narrative of transition from the age of empires to a period of nationalism. Muslim intellectuals were critical of European imperial hegemony but they were not necessarily against the idea of an empire. It was not ethnic nationalism, but transnational Islamic modernism and pro-Ottoman discourses that seemed dominant in late 19th century Muslim intellectual networks.     Moreover, the aftermath of WWI did not symbolize a turning point for decolonization, but attempts at further colonization of Muslim societies and the shock of the abolishment of caliphate. Modern Muslim thought does not fit into Arnold Toynbee\u2019s civilizational world history narratives (or Samuel Huntington\u2019s Clash of Civilization thesis) either.     This seminar talk suggest that a new world history methodology can help us overcome the contradictions in the national, imperial and civilizational approaches to the long 19th century political history of Muslim societies by historicizing and contextualizing the politics of the long 19th century global \u201cMuslim world\u201d identity.
