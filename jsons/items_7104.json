Manufacturers need to know how to choose chemical compounds for a given function from a vast space of all possible compounds\u2014dissolving once ingested, and not in the bottle, in the case of pharmaceuticals, or maintaining their form under harsh weather conditions in the case of construction materials.   In order to understand the how best to go about predicting these structures, researchers rely on a construct called the free energy surface, a multidimensional mathematical object that reveals optimal spatial or geometrical configurations of a given system--whether it pertains to pharmaceuticals or computer chips. However, because the molecular constituents of such systems of interest and their interactions are often remarkably complex, elucidating these multi-dimensional free energy surfaces in order to derive the best \u201cmolecular answers\u201d has presented significant challenges to scientists.   To help overcome this, the NYU team focused on a particular aspect of free energy surfaces: landmarks, which are considered, chemically and/or structurally, the most important features of these extremely complex, or high-dimensional, surfaces.   Specifically, relying on a computer simulation of free energy surfaces, they developed an algorithm designed to spot these landmarks while \u201cseeing over\u201d the terrain\u2019s high dimensionality.   The method, Tuckerman explains, \u201cgives a rendering of a complex terrain that is computationally tractable by generating the most important and useful facets of free energy surfaces. From these facets, we can ultimately determine not only the most favored conformations of the constituent molecules and their spatial arrangements, but also the relative stability of these conformations and the likelihood of random conversions between them.\u201d   The paper\u2019s other authors are Ming Chen and Tang-Qing Yu, both doctoral candidates in NYU\u2019s Department of Chemistry.

Manufacturers need to know how to choose chemical compounds for a given function from a vast space of all possible compounds\u2014dissolving once ingested, and not in the bottle, in the case of pharmaceuticals, or maintaining their form under harsh weather conditions in the case of construction materials.   In order to understand the how best to go about predicting these structures, researchers rely on a construct called the free energy surface, a multidimensional mathematical object that reveals optimal spatial or geometrical configurations of a given system--whether it pertains to pharmaceuticals or computer chips. However, because the molecular constituents of such systems of interest and their interactions are often remarkably complex, elucidating these multi-dimensional free energy surfaces in order to derive the best \u201cmolecular answers\u201d has presented significant challenges to scientists.   To help overcome this, the NYU team focused on a particular aspect of free energy surfaces: landmarks, which are considered, chemically and/or structurally, the most important features of these extremely complex, or high-dimensional, surfaces.   Specifically, relying on a computer simulation of free energy surfaces, they developed an algorithm designed to spot these landmarks while \u201cseeing over\u201d the terrain\u2019s high dimensionality.   The method, Tuckerman explains, \u201cgives a rendering of a complex terrain that is computationally tractable by generating the most important and useful facets of free energy surfaces. From these facets, we can ultimately determine not only the most favored conformations of the constituent molecules and their spatial arrangements, but also the relative stability of these conformations and the likelihood of random conversions between them.\u201d   The paper\u2019s other authors are Ming Chen and Tang-Qing Yu, both doctoral candidates in NYU\u2019s Department of Chemistry.

cells began to emerge. The discovery of chromosomes, mitosis, and cell organelles required still another 50 years. This lecture focuses on the early history of microscopes and microscopical techniques, emphasizing the complex relationship between technology and the cell theory.
