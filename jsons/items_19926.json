This achievement shatters the previous record, setting a new benchmark for the most sensitive limit of detection, and may significantly advance early disease diagnostics. Unlike current technology, which attaches a fluorescent molecule, or label, to the antigen to allow it to be seen, the new process detects the antigen without an interfering label.    Stephen Arnold , university professor of applied physics and member of the Othmer-Jacobs Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, published details of the achievement in Nano Letters , a publication of the American Chemical Society.   In 2012, Arnold and his team were able to detect in solution the smallest known RNA virus, MS2, with a mass of 6 attograms. Now, with experimental work by postdoctoral fellow Venkata Dantham and former student David Keng, two proteins have been detected: a human cancer marker protein called Thyroglobulin, with a mass of just 1 attogram, and the bovine form of a common plasma protein, serum albumin, with a far smaller mass of 0.11 attogram. &ldquo;An attogram is a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a gram,&rdquo; said Arnold, &ldquo;and we believe that our new limit of detection may be smaller than 0.01 attogram.&rdquo;   This latest milestone builds on a technique pioneered by Arnold and collaborators from NYU-Poly and Fordham University. In 2012, the researchers set the first sizing record by treating a novel biosensor with plasmonic gold nano-receptors, enhancing the electric field of the sensor and allowing even the smallest shifts in resonant frequency to be detected. Their plan was to design a medical diagnostic device capable of identifying a single virus particle in a point-of-care setting, without the use of special assay preparations.   At the time, the notion of detecting a single protein&mdash;phenomenally smaller than a virus&mdash;was set forth as the ultimate goal.   &ldquo;Proteins run the body,&rdquo; explained Arnold. &ldquo;When the immune system encounters virus, it pumps out huge quantities of antibody proteins, and all cancers generate protein markers. A test capable of detecting a single protein would be the most sensitive diagnostic test imaginable.&rdquo;   To the surprise of the researchers, examination of their nanoreceptor under a transmission electron microscope revealed that its gold shell surface was covered with random bumps roughly the size of a protein. Computer mapping and simulations created by Stephen Holler , once Arnold&rsquo;s student and now assistant professor of physics at Fordham University, showed that these irregularities generate their own highly reactive local sensitivity field extending out several nanometers, amplifying the capabilities of the sensor far beyond original predictions. &ldquo;A virus is far too large to be aided in detection by this field,&rdquo; Arnold said. &ldquo;Proteins are just a few nanometers across&mdash;exactly the right size to register in this space.&rdquo;   The implications of single protein detection are significant and may lay the foundation for improved medical therapeutics. Among other advances, Arnold and his colleagues posit that the ability to follow a signal in real time&mdash;to actually witness the detection of a single disease marker protein and track its movement&mdash;may yield new understanding of how proteins attach to antibodies.   Arnold named the novel method of label-free detection &ldquo;whispering gallery-mode biosensing&rdquo; because light waves in the system reminded him of the way that voices bounce around the whispering gallery under the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in London. A laser sends light through a glass fiber to a detector. When a microsphere is placed against the fiber, certain wavelengths of light detour into the sphere and bounce around inside, creating a dip in the light that the detector receives. When a molecule like a cancer marker clings to a gold nanoshell attached to the microsphere, the microsphere&rsquo;s resonant frequency shifts by a measureable amount.   The research has been supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). This summer, Arnold will begin the next stage of expanding the capacity for these biosensors. The NSF has awarded a new $200,000 grant to him in collaboration with University of Michigan professor Xudong Fan. The grant will support the construction of a multiplexed array of plasmonically enhanced resonators, which should allow a variety of protein to be identified in blood serum within minutes.   The publication in Nano Letters marks the 100 th journal-paper published since the 1978 founding of NYU-Poly&rsquo;s Microparticle Photophysics Laboratory for BioPhotonics, directed by Arnold.

As a first-year student, you are responsible for registering for classes. You will complete this process in consultation with your academic adviser. Specific guidance on how to select and register for appropriate courses will be provided as you approach your start at the School of Engineering. Below is an overview of what you&rsquo;ll need to complete in order to register for fall 2015 classes. You can find additional resources and how-to guides here: https://newclasses.nyu.edu/ .    If you&rsquo;ve been admitted into the General Studies or HEOP Program, you may have additional items to consider during the registration process, and will receive supplemental information to guide your enrollment experience.    Please direct any and all of your questions about the registration process for first-year students to the Academic Advisement Center (AAC): advisement@poly.edu   Registering for Classes, An Overview   Submit Your Tuition Deposit   This is the first step of the registration process, which not only signals your intent to pursue postsecondary education at the School of Engineering, but also allows us to officially matriculate you into your academic program. Please submit your deposit as soon as possible.   Take the Expository Writing Placement Exam   If you are required to take the expository writing placement exam, a site-based assessment, then you will be made aware of your status by email during the month of May. Upon taking the exam, you will be notified of your fall writing class. If you are required to take the writing placement exam, you must do so before you can enroll in your fall writing class. A writing course marker, a placeholder for the actual course, will be available to you, if you are not able to take the exam before registration begins. A schedule adjustment will be required, once your placement score has been determined, with the writing class replacing the course marker.   Take the Math Diagnostic Exam   You must complete the math diagnostic exam, or qualify for the exemption process , in order to determine your fall class. The math diagnostic exam is an on-site assessment and will take place on various dates before the beginning of the semester. While you are encouraged to complete the exam before the beginning of the registration period, you will be allowed to enroll in classes before completing the exam. A math course marker will be used to reserve a space in your schedule for math. You&rsquo;ll be able to go online after you complete the math exam to make a schedule adjustment, dropping the math course marker and adding the actual course .   Confirm Your Major   During the month of May, you will receive a correspondence from the School of Engineering asking you to confirm your intended major. If you&rsquo;d like to change your intended major, you must send your request to the Registrar&rsquo;s Office by Friday, May 22nd . It&rsquo;s important that we know your correct intended major because registration appointments are based on your major. Download major change form .   Submit AP and Transfer Credits   If you&rsquo;ve earned credits as a result of an AP exam and/or previous college experience, you may be exempt from certain first-year courses. Please make sure to send such credit information to the School of Engineering in a timely manner so it can be posted to your transcript during the beginning of the registration period. This will allow the credits to be considered, as you finalize your fall schedule. Request your AP score by contacting the College Board and sending your scores to NYU (CEEB code: 2562). Review AP credit chart .   Watch the Pre-registration Tutorial   You are required to complete an instructional package, where you&rsquo;ll receive information on your first-year courses, how they are connected to your intended major, and how to select and enroll in the appropriate fall courses.

This achievement shatters the previous record, setting a new benchmark for the most sensitive limit of detection, and may significantly advance early disease diagnostics. Unlike current technology, which attaches a fluorescent molecule, or label, to the antigen to allow it to be seen, the new process detects the antigen without an interfering label.    Stephen Arnold , university professor of applied physics and member of the Othmer-Jacobs Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, published details of the achievement in Nano Letters , a publication of the American Chemical Society.   In 2012, Arnold and his team were able to detect in solution the smallest known RNA virus, MS2, with a mass of 6 attograms. Now, with experimental work by postdoctoral fellow Venkata Dantham and former student David Keng, two proteins have been detected: a human cancer marker protein called Thyroglobulin, with a mass of just 1 attogram, and the bovine form of a common plasma protein, serum albumin, with a far smaller mass of 0.11 attogram. &ldquo;An attogram is a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a gram,&rdquo; said Arnold, &ldquo;and we believe that our new limit of detection may be smaller than 0.01 attogram.&rdquo;   This latest milestone builds on a technique pioneered by Arnold and collaborators from NYU-Poly and Fordham University. In 2012, the researchers set the first sizing record by treating a novel biosensor with plasmonic gold nano-receptors, enhancing the electric field of the sensor and allowing even the smallest shifts in resonant frequency to be detected. Their plan was to design a medical diagnostic device capable of identifying a single virus particle in a point-of-care setting, without the use of special assay preparations.   At the time, the notion of detecting a single protein&mdash;phenomenally smaller than a virus&mdash;was set forth as the ultimate goal.   &ldquo;Proteins run the body,&rdquo; explained Arnold. &ldquo;When the immune system encounters virus, it pumps out huge quantities of antibody proteins, and all cancers generate protein markers. A test capable of detecting a single protein would be the most sensitive diagnostic test imaginable.&rdquo;   To the surprise of the researchers, examination of their nanoreceptor under a transmission electron microscope revealed that its gold shell surface was covered with random bumps roughly the size of a protein. Computer mapping and simulations created by Stephen Holler , once Arnold&rsquo;s student and now assistant professor of physics at Fordham University, showed that these irregularities generate their own highly reactive local sensitivity field extending out several nanometers, amplifying the capabilities of the sensor far beyond original predictions. &ldquo;A virus is far too large to be aided in detection by this field,&rdquo; Arnold said. &ldquo;Proteins are just a few nanometers across&mdash;exactly the right size to register in this space.&rdquo;   The implications of single protein detection are significant and may lay the foundation for improved medical therapeutics. Among other advances, Arnold and his colleagues posit that the ability to follow a signal in real time&mdash;to actually witness the detection of a single disease marker protein and track its movement&mdash;may yield new understanding of how proteins attach to antibodies.   Arnold named the novel method of label-free detection &ldquo;whispering gallery-mode biosensing&rdquo; because light waves in the system reminded him of the way that voices bounce around the whispering gallery under the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in London. A laser sends light through a glass fiber to a detector. When a microsphere is placed against the fiber, certain wavelengths of light detour into the sphere and bounce around inside, creating a dip in the light that the detector receives. When a molecule like a cancer marker clings to a gold nanoshell attached to the microsphere, the microsphere&rsquo;s resonant frequency shifts by a measureable amount.   The research has been supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). This summer, Arnold will begin the next stage of expanding the capacity for these biosensors. The NSF has awarded a new $200,000 grant to him in collaboration with University of Michigan professor Xudong Fan. The grant will support the construction of a multiplexed array of plasmonically enhanced resonators, which should allow a variety of protein to be identified in blood serum within minutes.   The publication in Nano Letters marks the 100 th journal-paper published since the 1978 founding of NYU-Poly&rsquo;s Microparticle Photophysics Laboratory for BioPhotonics, directed by Arnold.

The biopsies can be done under ultrasound, mammographic, or MRI guidance, depending on which modality the finding was best seen. \u00a0Below is a description of the different types of biopsies we do.           Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) is done under ultrasound guidance. A radiologist will use a thin needle to numb the skin with Lidocaine, a local anesthetic similar to what you receive at the dentist. The needle used is the same size or smaller than the needle used for drawing blood. At this time you may feel local stinging in the area, which lasts a few seconds but the numbing effect will be immediate. The radiologist will use a different needle to enter the skin using the ultrasound for precise placement. A wiggling motion will be used to try to aspirate fluid and cells into the needle. This is done at least 3 times, however, you should not experience pain. The radiologist will then hand the needles to a pathologist who will evaluate the samples under a microscope.      You will have your preliminary result within minutes, and before you leave the department. Occasionally the samples do not have enough material for the pathologist to make a diagnosis and a core biopsy will need to be performed. On rare occasions, the pathologist will change their diagnosis once they have brought the samples to the lab and done additional testing. If this happens, you will be notified of the change.           Core Biopsy can be done with ultrasound, mammographic (stereotactic), or MRI guidance. A titanium-based marker (also known as a \u201cclip\u201d) is placed for most core biopsies to mark the area in case surgery will be needed in the future. This clip will help guide the surgeon for accurate tissue removal. These specimens will be sent to the lab for analysis and the results will be available in approximately 4 business days. The marker clip will not react with metal detectors and it is too small to feel within your breast. It will show up only on your mammogram. These marker clips are placed at most facilities around the country, and are considered a standard part of the breast biopsy procedure. Core biopsies are generally very well tolerated and are preferred by most patients to surgical biopsies. No general anesthesia is used in our procedures and patients can get back to their normal activities quickly.           For ultrasound guided core biopsy, you will be able to lie on your back for the procedure. You will be given local anesthesia (Lidocaine) to the skin and around the area of concern. A small skin nick, about \u00bc inch, will be made to allow the needle to enter the breast with minimal trauma. Stitches will not be needed. The needle used for core biopsy is larger than FNA and will take samples that are larger. After the biopsy, a tiny clip will be placed in the biopsy site. Sterile strips will be placed over the skin nick to help the healing process. Once the marker clip has been put into the breast, a \u201cgentle\u201d mammogram will be performed to confirm a correct marker clip position should the area need to be surgically removed. A nurse will go over post biopsy instructions before you leave.           Stereotactic core biopsy is most commonly used to biopsy calcifications, but also may be used for masses or asymmetries not seen on ultrasound. For this procedure, you will be lying face down on a special bed, which has an opening for the breasts to come through. The breast will be under compression for this procedure and it is essential to be very still during the biopsy. Local anesthesia (Lidocaine) will be injected into the area and a small nick will be made in the skin to allow the biopsy needle to enter the breast. Stitches will not be needed. Once the site has been confirmed, the radiologist will guide the needle into the breast and take several tiny pieces of tissue. These biopsy samples will then be x-rayed to confirm that enough of the calcifications were removed and the marker clip will be placed in the breast to mark the biopsy site. This procedure uses a small amount of radiation, which is necessary to see the area that needs to be biopsied. Once the marker clip has been put into the breast, a \u201cgentle\u201d mammogram will be performed to confirm marker clip position should the area need to be surgically removed. The skin will be cleaned and sterile tape will be applied to the wound. A nurse will go over post biopsy instructions before you leave.             MRI guided core biopsy is done under the guidance of MRI. For this procedure, you will be lying face down with the breast coming through an opening in the table. The breast to be biopsied will be placed in a compression grid similar to that of mammograms. Multiple images will be taken and the area to be biopsied will be selected by the radiologist using special software.\u00a0 For this procedure, you will be under compression the entire time and required to stay as still as possible. You will be given local anesthesia (Lidocaine), to numb the skin and around the area of concern. A small skin nick, about \u00bc inch, will be made to allow the core biopsy needle to enter the breast with minimal trauma. Stitches will not be needed. Several samples will be then taken without removing the needle. Additional images will be taken after sampling to ensure sampling of the targeted area. If adequate, a clip will be placed into the biopsy cavity and images will be taken to ensure clip deployment. Sterile strips will be placed over the skin nick to help the healing process. A \u201cgentle\u201d mammogram will be performed to confirm a correct marker clip position should the area need to be surgically removed. A nurse will go over post biopsy instructions before you leave.              Needle Localization\u00a0 is a procedure where a wire is placed at the site of the abnormality to help guide the surgeon during your operation. This can be done by ultrasound, mammogram, or MRI guidance and depends on the type of abnormality being removed. Local anesthesia will be given to you to help with any discomfort during the procedure. If this is done using mammographic or MRI guidance, then you will be under compression like a mammogram for the length of the procedure and will be required to stay as still as possible. All needle localizations will require a mammogram showing the final placement of the wire, which will accompany you to the operating room.             Post Biopsy Instructions       Bruising and tenderness of the breast over the next few days is normal.       Use an ice pack 20 minutes on, 10 minutes off for the rest of the day.       No aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil/ Motrin), or any other blood thinner for at least 72 hours. You may use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for discomfort.       No heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 72 hours.       You may see spots of blood on the bandage; this is normal. In the case of excessive bleeding which does not stop with compression, go to the nearest emergency room.       You may shower the day after your procedure at which time you can remove the gauze dressing over the biopsy site. The steri-strips can get wet in the shower. If after 7 days they do not fall off by themselves, then remove them.       No tub bathing or swimming for 4 days.       If the biopsy skin site becomes red, hot, or is increasingly tender you may have an infection. Call your referring physician and/or go to your closest emergency room.       Your results should be available in approximately 4 business days. Your referring physician will be notified of the results, which you should discuss with him/her, unless your referring physician has indicated otherwise.      If you have any questions or concerns during business hours, please call (212) 731-5885. In an emergency, after business hours, you should call your referring physician or proceed to the nearest emergency room.
