A new project spearheaded by Steinhardt professor Perry Halkitis , doctoral candidate Robert Moeller, and recent MPH graduate Daniel Siconolfi, seeks to better understand the sexual behavior and health of this population.

It's sobering to discover that the smallest serving of ice cream is 400 calories (and that's without candy additives), a hot chocolate is 700, or a pizza-forone is more than 2,000. In the meantime, consider that most people need 2,000 to 3,000 a day. Low prices--and the huge excess of available calories-- encourage companies to market more food in larger amounts, thereby encouraging people to eat more calories than they need. My advice about healthful eating is simple: eat less; move more; eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; and don't eat too much junk food.       Amy Bentley  Associate Professor Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health                              A major problem is unequal access to healthy, clean food grown in a sustainable manner. While there has been dramatic growth in locally and seasonally produced agriculture -- farmers' markets, community supported agriculture, as well as organics, many people -- especially those in low-income neighborhoods -- do not have reliable access to fresh, affordable fruits and vegetables. Highly processed products, often high in calories and minimally nutritious, are cheaper, more abundant, and made more attractive by the millions of dollars food manufacturers spend on advertising them. We need to push harder for the overhaul of farm subsidies, to reward farmers who produce fruits and vegetables, and develop stronger regional food systems that require less energy, support farms of all sizes, and deliver fresher food to consumers.
