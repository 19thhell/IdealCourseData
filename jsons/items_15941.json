Our goal will be to acquire a grasp of the canon of American literature as it is typically conceived and the various logics behind its construction.   Key Topics   Topics to be considered include: the rise of \u201cliterature\u201d as a discipline unto itself; the meaning of American individualism; the conflict between liberty and equality in American social thought; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the relation between history and cultural mythology; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; the American obsession with race; the ideology of domesticity and its link to the sentimental; the aesthetics of American romance; the role of biography in literary criticism and historiography; the nature of the \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d; what it means to say \u201cNO in thunder!\u201d and why so many American writers seem to say it; deliberative democracy and cosmopolitanism.
