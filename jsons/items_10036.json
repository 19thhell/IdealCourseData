V90.0015 \u2013 Senior Seminar: Religion, Ethnicity, and the Secular Nation (Becker) Thursday; 12:30pm \u2013 3:15pm This seminar will provide an opportunity to examine the key categories of \u201cethnicity,\u201d \u201cthe nation,\u201d and \u201cthe secular\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis the development of the category of \u201creligion.\u201d The syllabus will include a variety of readings, from standard thinkers in modern political theory, such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, to the most recent anthropological and philosophical work on secularism and its critics. Students will be required to complete several written assignments and engage the readings and their peers as closely as possible. V90.0102 \u2013 Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Peters) Monday/Wednesday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This is a course on the world's three great monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It is not a history of each but a laying out of the three in a comparative context so that both the similarities and differences of each may be observed. They are posed, in a sense, for a family portrait, since each claims to be the \"Child of Abraham\" in the sense that it, and it alone, claims to be the heir to the promise made to Abraham by the God they all worship. The approach is historical and descriptive of beliefs and institutions, and each community is taken on its own terms and without polemical intent.    xV90.0113 \u2013 The Jews in Medieval Spain (Kozodoy) Tuesday/Thursday; 9:30am \u2013 10:45am The 700 years from the Muslim conquest of Spain in the eighth century to the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 saw the greatest levels of mutual toleration and coexistence among Jews, Christians, and Muslims achieved at any time during the Middle Ages. This course uses contemporary sources, from philosophical treatises to religious polemics to erotic love poetry, to introduce the history of this important Jewish community and its relationship to Muslim and Christian societies that surround it. It considers economic, cultural, and religious interactions, mutual influence, and violent conflict. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .    xV90.0220 \u2013 Early History of God (Fleming) Tuesday/Thursday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This course explores evidence concerning the appearance of monotheism in ancient Israel, including the Hebrew Bible, ancient writing from Israel and its neighbors, and a range of other artifacts. The premise of the course is that Israel was not alone in ascribing priority of power to a single god, and Israel\u2019s result is comprehensible only in the context of these wider currents. Student must also register for a recitation section. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .    V90.0302 \u2013 Introduction to the New Testament (Becker) Monday/Wednesday; 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm The purpose of this class is to introduce students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament as well as other important early Christian documents. No prior knowledge is required. Students will be given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament in a lecture hall setting where the professor will provide historical context and focus on significant issues, describe modern scholarly methodologies, and place the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion. The readings from secondary literature and several other non-canonical sources will provide a historical and literary context for the composition of the New Testament literature. Please note that the focus of this course is not the truth claims of Christianity or the refutation of them. This course is interested in the cultural history of the eastern Mediterranean in antiquity.    V90.0337 \u2013 Religions of India (Elmore) Tuesday/Thursday; 9:30am \u2013 10:45pm The goal of this course is to introduce students to the vibrant religious traditions of South Asia. The course will examine Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and Jain traditions as well as the ancient and modern contexts in which they are situated. In order to guide our inquiries we will focus on relations between religion and politics from the early Vedic period to the violent communalisms of the present. The class will include extensive use of visual resources in addition to traditional texts.    xV90.0404 \u2013 Classical Mythology (Meineck) Monday/Wednesday; 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm This course discusses the myths and legends of Greek mythology and the gods, demigods, heroes, nymphs, monsters, and everyday mortals who played out their parts in this mythology. This course begins with creation, as vividly described by Hesiod in the Theogony , and ends with the great Trojan War and the return of the Greek heroes, especially Odysseus. Roman myth is also treated, with emphasis on Aeneas and the foundation legends of Rome. This course is sponsored by the Department of Classics .    xV90.0639 \u2013 The Making of the Muslim Middle East, 600-1400 (Pregill) Tuesday/Thursday; 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm This course is a historical and comparative approach to the first half millennium of Islamic history. It traces the cultural and religious strands shaping the institutions, belief systems, and practices. Using primary sources, students explore the major debates in cultural history of this period. This course is sponsored by the Department of Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies .    V90.0650 \u2013 Topics: Religion, Colonialism and Post-colonialism (Elmore)  Tuesday/Thursday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm The foundations of religious studies are deeply intertwined with modern European colonialisms. For example, early social scientific efforts to locate the origins of religion drew from the field studies of colonial administrators and explorers. Modern methods in the comparative study of religions developed from efforts to identify the most appropriate means of converting, subduing, disciplining, and managing subject populations. Too often, however, this relationship is treated as an afterthought. By contrast, this course will focus centrally on the inextricable relations between \u201creligion\u201d and colonialisms. By investigating the various ways in which colonial powers employed \u201creligion\u201d we gain valuable insight into the evolution of the concept itself as well as the effects different understandings of religion had in colonial contexts.      In order to trace these differences, the course will be divided into three sections\u2014missions, management, and effects. In \u201cMissions,\u201d students will look at primary documents concerning colonialisms in which conversion was an important element, as well as scholarly treatment of these enterprises. In \u201cManagement,\u201d students will discuss how the concept of religion functioned in colonialisms of modernization. In the final section, \u201cEffects,\u201d students will concentrate on the growth of world religions and the effects of modern colonialism on colonizing and colonized societies. Of particular concern is the objectification and reconfiguration of indigenous traditions in the image of \u201creligion\u201d and how the experience and management of other traditions in turn transformed conceptions of religion in the metropole. As we move through these three sections we will also move through various regions in the world. We will begin by examining missions in the Americas and Africa. The management section will look at India and the Middle East. The final section will take examples from across the globe including Indonesia, Egypt, and the United States. V90.0650 \u2013 Topics: American Evangelicalism (Curtis) Tuesday/Thursday; 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm This course will examine the varieties of Evangelicalism in the United States. We will pay particular attention to how different groups of Evangelicals (i.e., Fundamentalists, Pentecostals, Neo-evangelicals) imagine their relationship to American political and cultural institutions. In addition to looking at significant theological movements within different groups and denominations, we will also cover Evangelical approaches to topics including revivalism, apocalypticism, scientific creationism, civil rights, education, law, sexual regulation, and mass media.    xV90.0674 \u2013 Islam and Politics (Haykel) Tuesday/Thursday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This course will attempt to explain the rise of Islamic political movements in the contemporary Middle East and look at the various ways in which they have been discussed in the media and in academic writings. Examples of Islamist writings and publications will also be presented in order to elucidate the ways in which Islamists depict themselves and their concerns. Because of the nature of these movements, the course will have a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing on concepts from politics, history and law. This course is sponsored by the Department of Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies .        xV90.0675 \u2013 Jewish Philosophy in the Medieval World (Kozodoy) Tuesday/Thursday; 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm This course will focus on readings (in translation) and analysis of representative selections from the writings of the major Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages, with emphasis on the Kuzari of Yehuda Halevi and the Guide to the Perplexed of Moses Maimonides. Special attention will be paid to the cultural context in which these works were produced. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .      xV90.0695 \u2013 American Jewish History (Diner) Tuesday/Thursday; 8:00am \u2013 9:15am Students in this course will examine the major events and personalities in American Jewish history since colonial time, including the waves of Jewish immigration and development of the American Jewish community. Student must also register for a recitation section. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .    V90.0706 \u2013 Muslim Spain (Peters) Monday/Wednesday; 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm The intent of this course is to introduce the student to one of the two examples \u2013 the other was the Balkans \u2013 when there was a long-time Muslim polity in Europe. The course will trace the political flow of events, from the Arab-Berber conquest of the peninsula and their experiments in state-formation to the gradual emergence of Christian rivals in the northern kingdoms and the reversal of the tide until the final submission of the surviving Muslim enclave of Granada in 1492. The chief emphasis, however, will be on 1) the construction of a remarkable social and intellectual culture out of the various indigenous and imported elements available; 2) how the three indigestible ingredients called Islam, Christianity and Judaism fared in that melting pot, particularly when one of the others was stirring; and 3) the problems posed by the notion of \"Muslim Spain\" for Spanish historians and for Westerners generally.    xV90.0719 \u2013 Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Religion (Goelet) Monday/Wednesday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This course examines the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, including the nature of the gods, syncretism, private religion, theories of divine kingship, the judgment of the dead, cultic practices, the life of priests, the relationship between this world and the afterlife, wisdom literature as moral thought, festivals, funerary practices, creation myths, and foreign gods and influences \u2013 all illustrated by Egyptian religious texts or scenes from temples and tombs. This course is sponsored by the Department of Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies .    xV90.0807 \u2013 Dead Sea Scrolls: Judaism and Christianity (Schiffman) Tuesday/Thursday; 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm This course is a survey of the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls for the history of early Judaism and Christianity and will include readings and discussions of English translations of the major texts. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .    V90.0981 \u2013 Internship (Staff) TBD    V90.0998 \u2013 Independent Study (Staff) TBD"}]},

Advanced Seminar: Comparative Topics in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 15 Prerequisites: junior or senior status, Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1), and at least two other religious studies courses, or permission of the instructor. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Complements and develops the methodological and theoretical emphasis encountered in Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, albeit with a higher level of specificity and sophistication. The focus is on a specific thematic motif with cross-cultural applicability (for example, ritual, the body, sacrifice, religion and the state). Students can explore the import of the motif in question for their own area of specialization, as well as examine its manifestations in other traditions. Students are expected to make formal presentations to the class. What Is Islam? RELST-UA 85 Identical to MEIS-UA 691, HIST-UA 85. Offered yearly. 4 points. An introductory course dealing with the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of Islam; the beliefs and practices of the Islamic community; differences between Sunni and Shi\u2019ite Islam; Sufism; the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life of the Islamic commonwealth; and modern Islamic revival.

Students reexamine the light shed by ancient writings (and other evidence) not only on the role(s) of women in ancient Christian groups but also on the ideologies of gender promoted or assumed by those groups. The focus, while predominantly on women, also extends to the way in which gender identities were constructed and adhered to by males and females. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam RELST-UA 102 Identical to MEDI-UA 25, MEIS-UA 800, HBRJD-UA 160. Offered yearly. 4 points. This course seeks to uncover the differences and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as religious traditions, and to assess their roles and interactions in the formation and functions of human societies. We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions.

The Chinese word for religion means \u201cteaching.\u201d \u201cTeaching\u201d immediately implies at least two people, and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. The course explores what Chinese people \u201ctaught\u201d themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; and Buddhism and the synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings.\u201d We will introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic. Classical Mythology RELST-UA 404 Identical to CLASS-UA 404. Meineche. 4 points. See description under Classics in this Bulletin. Jewish Responses to Modernity: Religion and Nationalism RELST-UA 470 Identical to HBRJD-UA 719. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin. Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah RELST-UA 561 Offered every other year. Pellegrini. 4 points. Traces the different uses and forms \u201cthe confession\u201d has taken in Western culture. How has the confession evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouTube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects?

Jews and Christians in the Ancient World RELST-UA 611 Identical to CLASS-UA 611, HBRJD-UA 128. Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \u201creal\u201d world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulating sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d sex, what bodies are \u201cfor,\u201d and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implications, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the interdisciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies. Topics in Religious Studies RELST-UA 650 4 points. The emphasis of this course varies each year and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields.

Christian evangelicals makes up over a quarter of the American population\u2014by some estimates number up to 100 million people\u2014and have held central leadership positions in government, business, and entertainment. But where did they come from, and what do they believe? This course traces the history of modern evangelicalism from its roots in the transatlantic awakenings of the 18th century through to the present. Along the way, we cover colonial America and religion in the new nation, evangelical reform in the nineteenth century, the clash between fundamentalists and modernists, holiness and Pentecostal movements, African American evangelicalism and the civil rights movement, the Christian right, youth movements, and neo-evangelicalism. We address variations in theology and religious practice with particular attention to how evangelicals have negotiated, revised, or defined central tenets of modern Western culture, including contemporary understandings of gender, race and ethnicity, performance, nation, sexuality, and economies. Anthropology of Religion RELST-UA 829 Identical to ANTH-UA 30. 4 points. See description under Anthropology in this Bulletin. Introduction to Buddhism RELST-UA 832 Identical to EAST-UA 832.

An introduction to Tibetan Buddhism doctrine and practice. Approaches the subject from historical and thematic perspectives, beginning with a close study of one of the classic Tibetan guides to Tibetan Buddhism for a solid foundation in the principles of the tradition. Proceeds along a historical track, beginning with the seventh-century arrival of Buddhism in Tibet to the present-day encounter with Western devotees of exiled Tibetan lamas. Topics include doctrinal innovation, ritual, myth, art, sacred geography, revelation, and the role of Buddhism in Tibet\u2019s relationship with its neighbors. Readings consist of primary texts in translation and secondary literature on the study of religion and Tibetan Buddhism. The Sufis: Mystics of Islam RELST-UA 863 Identical to MEIS-UA 863.

This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \u201cIslamic society\u201d is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings."}, {"content": "Spring 2011 Undergraduate Course Descriptions    | Religious Studies | NYU                                                                                                                                                        Back to Previous Page         Spring 2011 Undergraduate Course Descriptions         *some course syllabi from cross-listed courses may not appear, but may be available on the host departments' websites.         V90.0015 \u2013 Advanced Seminar: Religion, Gender, and Violence (Pellegrini)     This seminar asks how religion contributes to social violence as well as to movements for peace and reconciliation. Throughout the semester, students will pay especial attention to the ways in which women are enlisted as both victims and agents of religiously-motivated violence. However, the keyword gender is not just a synonym for women. Gender as a category of analysis focuses attention on the social construction and organization of bodies and on the often violent hierarchalization of difference along the axes masculine/feminine. Gender is a social relation embedded in other social relations. How do religious beliefs and forms of belonging contribute to the social imagination and experience of gender, and vice versa? In what ways are gender relations implicated in religious violence? Drawing on critical theories of religion and recent work in gender studies and feminist post-colonial studies, this seminar will push students to examine questions of historical change, cultural variation, national/geographic difference, and moral complexity. Permission of the department is required to register for this course.          V90.0085 - What Is Islam? (Walton)     An introduction to the common religious, cultural, and political base of what is generally and popularly called \"Islam.\" This course will concentrate on the fundamentals from the Quranic origins of the faith and the career of the Prophet Muhammad to the beliefs and observances shared by most Muslims and some of the differences among them.          xV90.0125 - Ancient Near Eastern Mythology (Fleming)     The myths of the ancient Near East represent the earliest literary expressions of human thought. Students in this class read myths from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ugarit, Anatolia, and Israel, studying the myths themselves as literary works as well as exploring the ideas and broader issues that shaped them. These myths, including both extensive literary masterpieces such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and shorter work such as the Flight of Etana to Heaven, offer a window into the religious mentality of the ancient Near East, which in turn laid the foundation for many elements of modern Western culture        xV90.0140 \u2013 Varieties of Religious Experience Revisited (Gilligan)     This course is being offered as an Advanced Honors Seminar and will be taught by a non-Religious Studies faculty member. Interested students should contact the instructor for a course description. * This course does NOT replace the Advanced Seminar requirement for Religious Studies Majors*         xV90.0220 \u2013 Early History of God (Benz)     This course explores evidence concerning the appearance of monotheism in ancient Israel , including the Hebrew Bible, ancient writing from Israel and its neighbors, and a range of other artifacts. The premise of the course is that Israel was not alone in ascribing priority of power to a single god, and Israel \u2019s result is comprehensible only in the context of these wider currents. Student must also register for a recitation section. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .          xV90.0270 \u2013 European Reformations: Protestant, Catholic, and Radical (Yoffie)     This course aims to study the Reformation in a broad context, both diachronically and synchronically. We will look at the medieval intellectual and religious contexts that preceded the Lutheran Reformation, its \u201cReformed,\u201d Catholic, and radical counterparts, and its effects on early modern intellectual and popular culture. Then, we will study reform movements in eastern and central Europe and the work of the Jesuits, a product of the Catholic Reformation, in the Americas and Asia . Lectures and the course website will feature visual sources, such as Reformation broadsheets and icons, maps, and depictions by Europeans of non-western societies. Primary sources will include works by the Reformers themselves and by their enemies, by peasants and priests, and by heretics and their opponents. This course is sponsored by the Department of History          xV90.0293 \u2013 Belief and Practice in Greek Religion (Kowalzig)  The religions of ancient Greece and Rome are often regarded as highly pragmatic: they are thought to focus on \u2018practice\u2019, on ritual activity, ceremony and performance. Religious practice and social life, it is held, were so much intertwined that the question of \u2018belief\u2019 did not really matter. As a result, historians of religion often neglect the emotional and intellectual dimensions of ancient belief-systems. Our course challenges the artificial separation of belief from practice by studying both ancient texts and modern theory. We take a close look at ancient sources for ritual activity and at modern ritual theory. We also examine evidence of philosophical and self-reflexive attitudes to religious practice and the divine, and follow the academic debate from its beginnings to exciting new approaches informed by the cognitive sciences. We study a wide range of ancient sources from tragedy and hymnic poetry to inscriptions, ancient shrines and religious imagery. Accompanied by readings from social and cultural anthropology, religious sociology, philosophy and performance studies, all ancient texts will be read in translation.          V90.0302 \u2013 Introduction to the New Testament (Becker)     The purpose of this class is to introduce students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament as well as other important early Christian documents. No prior knowledge is required. Students will be given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament in a lecture hall setting where the professor will provide historical context and focus on significant issues, describe modern scholarly methodologies, and place the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion. The readings from secondary literature and several other non-canonical sources will provide a historical and literary context for the composition of the New Testament literature. Please note that the focus of this course is not the truth claims of Christianity or the refutation of them. This course is interested in the cultural history of the eastern Mediterranean in antiquity.          V90.0351 \u2013 Belief and Social Life in China (Zito)     The Chinese word for \"religion\" means \"teaching.\" \"Teaching\" immediately implies at least two people and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. This course will explore what Chinese people \"taught\" themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. Students will examine in historical perspective the classical texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; Buddhism and the synthesis of the \"Three Teachings.\" This course will also introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic.        xV90.0404 \u2013 Classical Mythology (Meineck)     This course discusses the myths and legends of Greek mythology and the gods, demigods, heroes, nymphs, monsters, and everyday mortals who played out their parts in this mythology. This course begins with creation, as vividly described by Hesiod in the Theogony , and ends with the great Trojan War and the return of the Greek heroes, especially Odysseus. Roman myth is also treated, with emphasis on Aeneas and the foundation legends of Rome . This course is sponsored by the Department of Classics .        V90.0650 \u2013 Topics: Post Christian Nation? Religion in America since the Civil War (Petro)     This course covers major themes in religion and American society from the Civil War to present. Students will develop a historical understanding of the various religions practiced in the United States in this period; examine some of the major rifts and alliances between religion and social life in America; think critically about preconceived ideas concerning religion in the United States and, indeed, concerning the category of \u201creligion\u201d itself; and analyze religious practice within the contexts of race, gender, sexuality, and geography. Topics include the rise of modern science and its impact on evangelical Christianity; the development of liberal religion (Protestant and Catholic), American Judaism, the resurgence of mainstream evangelicalism, religious counterculture, immigration and the growth of eastern religions, American Islam, the \u201cnew atheist\u201d movement, and the rise of the Christian right.        V90.0650 \u2013Topics: Pilgrims, Tourists, and Wanderers (Sion)     This course will explore the relationship between travel and religion, from pilgrimage to the grave of saints to religious theme parks. Our wanderings will take us to sites of death (Elvis Presley, Cambodian killing fields), miracles (Virgin of Guadalupe), and entertainment ( Holy Land experience). We will pick up material souvenirs, touch relics and leave mementos of our visit. We will meet the Wandering Jew and discuss migrations of the Diaspora. We will explore all kinds of religions (including civil religion) and practices (including the Jerusalem Syndrome). We will look at travel as a medium, performance, and ritual of religion. No prerequisite, visa or frequent flyer program is necessary to come on board.         xV90.0680 \u2013 History of Judaism I: The Emergence of Classical Judaism  (Schiffman)     This course focuses on the history of Judaism during its formative periods, including Hellenistic Judaism, Jewish sectarianism, and the ultimate emergence of the rabbinic system of religion and law. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies.          xV90.0681 - Modern Jewish History (Aleksiun)     This course focuses on major developments in the history and culture of the Jews from the 16th to the 20th centuries, emphasizing the meanings of modernity in the Jewish context, differing paths to modern Jewish identity, and internal Jewish debates over the relative merits of modern and traditional Jewish values. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies.          xV90.0719 \u2013 Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Religion (Goelet)     This course examines the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, including the nature of the gods, syncretism, private religion, theories of divine kingship, the judgment of the dead, cultic practices, the life of priests, the relationship between this world and the afterlife, wisdom literature as moral thought, festivals, funerary practices, creation myths, and foreign gods and influences \u2013 all illustrated by Egyptian religious texts or scenes from temples and tombs. This course is sponsored by the Department of Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies .        xV90.0829 - Anthropology of Religion (Beidelman)     Examines the cultural nature of basic beliefs and values manifested in both simple and complex societies.

Students will be required to complete several written assignments and engage the readings and their peers as closely as possible. V90.0102 \u2013 Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Peters) Monday/Wednesday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This is a course on the world's three great monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It is not a history of each but a laying out of the three in a comparative context so that both the similarities and differences of each may be observed. They are posed, in a sense, for a family portrait, since each claims to be the \"Child of Abraham\" in the sense that it, and it alone, claims to be the heir to the promise made to Abraham by the God they all worship. The approach is historical and descriptive of beliefs and institutions, and each community is taken on its own terms and without polemical intent.    xV90.0113 \u2013 The Jews in Medieval Spain (Kozodoy) Tuesday/Thursday; 9:30am \u2013 10:45am The 700 years from the Muslim conquest of Spain in the eighth century to the expulsion of the Jews in 1492 saw the greatest levels of mutual toleration and coexistence among Jews, Christians, and Muslims achieved at any time during the Middle Ages. This course uses contemporary sources, from philosophical treatises to religious polemics to erotic love poetry, to introduce the history of this important Jewish community and its relationship to Muslim and Christian societies that surround it. It considers economic, cultural, and religious interactions, mutual influence, and violent conflict. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .    xV90.0220 \u2013 Early History of God (Fleming) Tuesday/Thursday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This course explores evidence concerning the appearance of monotheism in ancient Israel, including the Hebrew Bible, ancient writing from Israel and its neighbors, and a range of other artifacts.

V90.0337 \u2013 Religions of India (Elmore) Tuesday/Thursday; 9:30am \u2013 10:45pm The goal of this course is to introduce students to the vibrant religious traditions of South Asia. The course will examine Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and Jain traditions as well as the ancient and modern contexts in which they are situated. In order to guide our inquiries we will focus on relations between religion and politics from the early Vedic period to the violent communalisms of the present. The class will include extensive use of visual resources in addition to traditional texts.    xV90.0404 \u2013 Classical Mythology (Meineck) Monday/Wednesday; 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm This course discusses the myths and legends of Greek mythology and the gods, demigods, heroes, nymphs, monsters, and everyday mortals who played out their parts in this mythology. This course begins with creation, as vividly described by Hesiod in the Theogony , and ends with the great Trojan War and the return of the Greek heroes, especially Odysseus.

It traces the cultural and religious strands shaping the institutions, belief systems, and practices. Using primary sources, students explore the major debates in cultural history of this period. This course is sponsored by the Department of Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies .    V90.0650 \u2013 Topics: Religion, Colonialism and Post-colonialism (Elmore)  Tuesday/Thursday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm The foundations of religious studies are deeply intertwined with modern European colonialisms. For example, early social scientific efforts to locate the origins of religion drew from the field studies of colonial administrators and explorers. Modern methods in the comparative study of religions developed from efforts to identify the most appropriate means of converting, subduing, disciplining, and managing subject populations. Too often, however, this relationship is treated as an afterthought. By contrast, this course will focus centrally on the inextricable relations between \u201creligion\u201d and colonialisms. By investigating the various ways in which colonial powers employed \u201creligion\u201d we gain valuable insight into the evolution of the concept itself as well as the effects different understandings of religion had in colonial contexts.      In order to trace these differences, the course will be divided into three sections\u2014missions, management, and effects. In \u201cMissions,\u201d students will look at primary documents concerning colonialisms in which conversion was an important element, as well as scholarly treatment of these enterprises. In \u201cManagement,\u201d students will discuss how the concept of religion functioned in colonialisms of modernization. In the final section, \u201cEffects,\u201d students will concentrate on the growth of world religions and the effects of modern colonialism on colonizing and colonized societies. Of particular concern is the objectification and reconfiguration of indigenous traditions in the image of \u201creligion\u201d and how the experience and management of other traditions in turn transformed conceptions of religion in the metropole. As we move through these three sections we will also move through various regions in the world. We will begin by examining missions in the Americas and Africa. The management section will look at India and the Middle East. The final section will take examples from across the globe including Indonesia, Egypt, and the United States. V90.0650 \u2013 Topics: American Evangelicalism (Curtis) Tuesday/Thursday; 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm This course will examine the varieties of Evangelicalism in the United States. We will pay particular attention to how different groups of Evangelicals (i.e., Fundamentalists, Pentecostals, Neo-evangelicals) imagine their relationship to American political and cultural institutions. In addition to looking at significant theological movements within different groups and denominations, we will also cover Evangelical approaches to topics including revivalism, apocalypticism, scientific creationism, civil rights, education, law, sexual regulation, and mass media.    xV90.0674 \u2013 Islam and Politics (Haykel) Tuesday/Thursday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This course will attempt to explain the rise of Islamic political movements in the contemporary Middle East and look at the various ways in which they have been discussed in the media and in academic writings. Examples of Islamist writings and publications will also be presented in order to elucidate the ways in which Islamists depict themselves and their concerns. Because of the nature of these movements, the course will have a multi-disciplinary approach, drawing on concepts from politics, history and law. This course is sponsored by the Department of Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies .        xV90.0675 \u2013 Jewish Philosophy in the Medieval World (Kozodoy) Tuesday/Thursday; 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm This course will focus on readings (in translation) and analysis of representative selections from the writings of the major Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages, with emphasis on the Kuzari of Yehuda Halevi and the Guide to the Perplexed of Moses Maimonides.

V90.0706 \u2013 Muslim Spain (Peters) Monday/Wednesday; 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm The intent of this course is to introduce the student to one of the two examples \u2013 the other was the Balkans \u2013 when there was a long-time Muslim polity in Europe. The course will trace the political flow of events, from the Arab-Berber conquest of the peninsula and their experiments in state-formation to the gradual emergence of Christian rivals in the northern kingdoms and the reversal of the tide until the final submission of the surviving Muslim enclave of Granada in 1492. The chief emphasis, however, will be on 1) the construction of a remarkable social and intellectual culture out of the various indigenous and imported elements available; 2) how the three indigestible ingredients called Islam, Christianity and Judaism fared in that melting pot, particularly when one of the others was stirring; and 3) the problems posed by the notion of \"Muslim Spain\" for Spanish historians and for Westerners generally.    xV90.0719 \u2013 Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Religion (Goelet) Monday/Wednesday; 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm This course examines the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, including the nature of the gods, syncretism, private religion, theories of divine kingship, the judgment of the dead, cultic practices, the life of priests, the relationship between this world and the afterlife, wisdom literature as moral thought, festivals, funerary practices, creation myths, and foreign gods and influences \u2013 all illustrated by Egyptian religious texts or scenes from temples and tombs.

Focuses on fundamental theoretical and methodological issues pertaining to the academic study of religion. Exposes students to, and familiarizes them with, some of the more important theories of the origin, character, and function of religion as a human phenomenon. Students are given an opportunity to encounter and test an assortment of the main scholarly approaches to understanding and interpreting religious phenomena, including psychological, sociological, anthropological, historical, and hermeneutical perspectives. Advanced Seminar: Comparative Topics in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 15 Prerequisites: junior or senior status, Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1), and at least two other religious studies courses, or permission of the instructor. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Complements and develops the methodological and theoretical emphasis encountered in Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, albeit with a higher level of specificity and sophistication. The focus is on a specific thematic motif with cross-cultural applicability (for example, ritual, the body, sacrifice, religion and the state). Students can explore the import of the motif in question for their own area of specialization, as well as examine its manifestations in other traditions. Students are expected to make formal presentations to the class. What Is Islam? RELST-UA 85 Identical to MEIS-UA 691, HIST-UA 85. Offered yearly. 4 points. An introductory course dealing with the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of Islam; the beliefs and practices of the Islamic community; differences between Sunni and Shi\u2019ite Islam; Sufism; the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life of the Islamic commonwealth; and modern Islamic revival. Gender, Sexuality, and the Body in Early Christianity RELST-UA 86 Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students reexamine the light shed by ancient writings (and other evidence) not only on the role(s) of women in ancient Christian groups but also on the ideologies of gender promoted or assumed by those groups. The focus, while predominantly on women, also extends to the way in which gender identities were constructed and adhered to by males and females. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam RELST-UA 102 Identical to MEDI-UA 25, MEIS-UA 800, HBRJD-UA 160. Offered yearly. 4 points. This course seeks to uncover the differences and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as religious traditions, and to assess their roles and interactions in the formation and functions of human societies. We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions.

Belief and Social Life in China RELST-UA 351 Identical to ANTH-UA 351, EAST-UA 351. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points . The Chinese word for religion means \u201cteaching.\u201d \u201cTeaching\u201d immediately implies at least two people, and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. The course explores what Chinese people \u201ctaught\u201d themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; and Buddhism and the synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings.\u201d We will introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic. Classical Mythology RELST-UA 404 Identical to CLASS-UA 404. Meineche. 4 points. See description under Classics in this Bulletin. Jewish Responses to Modernity: Religion and Nationalism RELST-UA 470 Identical to HBRJD-UA 719. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin. Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah RELST-UA 561 Offered every other year. Pellegrini. 4 points. Traces the different uses and forms \u201cthe confession\u201d has taken in Western culture. How has the confession evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouTube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects?

Jews and Christians in the Ancient World RELST-UA 611 Identical to CLASS-UA 611, HBRJD-UA 128. Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \u201creal\u201d world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulating sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d sex, what bodies are \u201cfor,\u201d and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implications, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the interdisciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies. Topics in Religious Studies RELST-UA 650 4 points. The emphasis of this course varies each year and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included Christianity and culture, American evangelicalism, religion and violence, and postcolonialism. Martyrdom, Ancient and Modern RELST-UA 660 Identical to CLASS-UA 646. Offered every other year. Becker. 4 points. Examines the theory and practice of martyrdom in the West. Begins with a close study of the development of the martyrological discourse in classical, early Christian, early Jewish, and Muslim literature and culture. Also traces how the concept of martyrdom is deployed in modern culture in various phenomena, such as the \u201cColumbine martyrs,\u201d \u201cmartyrdom operations\u201d (\u201csuicide bombers\u201d), political martyrdom, and modern notions of holy war.

Christian evangelicals makes up over a quarter of the American population\u2014by some estimates number up to 100 million people\u2014and have held central leadership positions in government, business, and entertainment. But where did they come from, and what do they believe? This course traces the history of modern evangelicalism from its roots in the transatlantic awakenings of the 18th century through to the present. Along the way, we cover colonial America and religion in the new nation, evangelical reform in the nineteenth century, the clash between fundamentalists and modernists, holiness and Pentecostal movements, African American evangelicalism and the civil rights movement, the Christian right, youth movements, and neo-evangelicalism. We address variations in theology and religious practice with particular attention to how evangelicals have negotiated, revised, or defined central tenets of modern Western culture, including contemporary understandings of gender, race and ethnicity, performance, nation, sexuality, and economies. Anthropology of Religion RELST-UA 829 Identical to ANTH-UA 30. 4 points. See description under Anthropology in this Bulletin. Introduction to Buddhism RELST-UA 832 Identical to EAST-UA 832.

Proceeds along a historical track, beginning with the seventh-century arrival of Buddhism in Tibet to the present-day encounter with Western devotees of exiled Tibetan lamas. Topics include doctrinal innovation, ritual, myth, art, sacred geography, revelation, and the role of Buddhism in Tibet\u2019s relationship with its neighbors. Readings consist of primary texts in translation and secondary literature on the study of religion and Tibetan Buddhism. The Sufis: Mystics of Islam RELST-UA 863 Identical to MEIS-UA 863.

Independent Study RELST-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 1 to 4 points per term. Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4 points. This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \u201cIslamic society\u201d is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings."}, {"content": "Spring 2011 Undergraduate Course Descriptions    | Religious Studies | NYU                                                                                                                                                        Back to Previous Page         Spring 2011 Undergraduate Course Descriptions         *some course syllabi from cross-listed courses may not appear, but may be available on the host departments' websites.         V90.0015 \u2013 Advanced Seminar: Religion, Gender, and Violence (Pellegrini)     This seminar asks how religion contributes to social violence as well as to movements for peace and reconciliation. Throughout the semester, students will pay especial attention to the ways in which women are enlisted as both victims and agents of religiously-motivated violence. However, the keyword gender is not just a synonym for women. Gender as a category of analysis focuses attention on the social construction and organization of bodies and on the often violent hierarchalization of difference along the axes masculine/feminine. Gender is a social relation embedded in other social relations. How do religious beliefs and forms of belonging contribute to the social imagination and experience of gender, and vice versa? In what ways are gender relations implicated in religious violence? Drawing on critical theories of religion and recent work in gender studies and feminist post-colonial studies, this seminar will push students to examine questions of historical change, cultural variation, national/geographic difference, and moral complexity. Permission of the department is required to register for this course.          V90.0085 - What Is Islam? (Walton)     An introduction to the common religious, cultural, and political base of what is generally and popularly called \"Islam.\" This course will concentrate on the fundamentals from the Quranic origins of the faith and the career of the Prophet Muhammad to the beliefs and observances shared by most Muslims and some of the differences among them.          xV90.0125 - Ancient Near Eastern Mythology (Fleming)     The myths of the ancient Near East represent the earliest literary expressions of human thought. Students in this class read myths from ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Ugarit, Anatolia, and Israel, studying the myths themselves as literary works as well as exploring the ideas and broader issues that shaped them. These myths, including both extensive literary masterpieces such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and shorter work such as the Flight of Etana to Heaven, offer a window into the religious mentality of the ancient Near East, which in turn laid the foundation for many elements of modern Western culture        xV90.0140 \u2013 Varieties of Religious Experience Revisited (Gilligan)     This course is being offered as an Advanced Honors Seminar and will be taught by a non-Religious Studies faculty member. Interested students should contact the instructor for a course description. * This course does NOT replace the Advanced Seminar requirement for Religious Studies Majors*         xV90.0220 \u2013 Early History of God (Benz)     This course explores evidence concerning the appearance of monotheism in ancient Israel , including the Hebrew Bible, ancient writing from Israel and its neighbors, and a range of other artifacts. The premise of the course is that Israel was not alone in ascribing priority of power to a single god, and Israel \u2019s result is comprehensible only in the context of these wider currents. Student must also register for a recitation section. This course is sponsored by the Department of Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies .          xV90.0270 \u2013 European Reformations: Protestant, Catholic, and Radical (Yoffie)     This course aims to study the Reformation in a broad context, both diachronically and synchronically. We will look at the medieval intellectual and religious contexts that preceded the Lutheran Reformation, its \u201cReformed,\u201d Catholic, and radical counterparts, and its effects on early modern intellectual and popular culture. Then, we will study reform movements in eastern and central Europe and the work of the Jesuits, a product of the Catholic Reformation, in the Americas and Asia . Lectures and the course website will feature visual sources, such as Reformation broadsheets and icons, maps, and depictions by Europeans of non-western societies. Primary sources will include works by the Reformers themselves and by their enemies, by peasants and priests, and by heretics and their opponents. This course is sponsored by the Department of History          xV90.0293 \u2013 Belief and Practice in Greek Religion (Kowalzig)  The religions of ancient Greece and Rome are often regarded as highly pragmatic: they are thought to focus on \u2018practice\u2019, on ritual activity, ceremony and performance. Religious practice and social life, it is held, were so much intertwined that the question of \u2018belief\u2019 did not really matter. As a result, historians of religion often neglect the emotional and intellectual dimensions of ancient belief-systems. Our course challenges the artificial separation of belief from practice by studying both ancient texts and modern theory. We take a close look at ancient sources for ritual activity and at modern ritual theory. We also examine evidence of philosophical and self-reflexive attitudes to religious practice and the divine, and follow the academic debate from its beginnings to exciting new approaches informed by the cognitive sciences. We study a wide range of ancient sources from tragedy and hymnic poetry to inscriptions, ancient shrines and religious imagery. Accompanied by readings from social and cultural anthropology, religious sociology, philosophy and performance studies, all ancient texts will be read in translation.          V90.0302 \u2013 Introduction to the New Testament (Becker)     The purpose of this class is to introduce students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament as well as other important early Christian documents. No prior knowledge is required. Students will be given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament in a lecture hall setting where the professor will provide historical context and focus on significant issues, describe modern scholarly methodologies, and place the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion. The readings from secondary literature and several other non-canonical sources will provide a historical and literary context for the composition of the New Testament literature. Please note that the focus of this course is not the truth claims of Christianity or the refutation of them. This course is interested in the cultural history of the eastern Mediterranean in antiquity.          V90.0351 \u2013 Belief and Social Life in China (Zito)     The Chinese word for \"religion\" means \"teaching.\" \"Teaching\" immediately implies at least two people and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. This course will explore what Chinese people \"taught\" themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. Students will examine in historical perspective the classical texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; Buddhism and the synthesis of the \"Three Teachings.\" This course will also introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic.        xV90.0404 \u2013 Classical Mythology (Meineck)     This course discusses the myths and legends of Greek mythology and the gods, demigods, heroes, nymphs, monsters, and everyday mortals who played out their parts in this mythology. This course begins with creation, as vividly described by Hesiod in the Theogony , and ends with the great Trojan War and the return of the Greek heroes, especially Odysseus. Roman myth is also treated, with emphasis on Aeneas and the foundation legends of Rome . This course is sponsored by the Department of Classics .        V90.0650 \u2013 Topics: Post Christian Nation? Religion in America since the Civil War (Petro)     This course covers major themes in religion and American society from the Civil War to present. Students will develop a historical understanding of the various religions practiced in the United States in this period; examine some of the major rifts and alliances between religion and social life in America; think critically about preconceived ideas concerning religion in the United States and, indeed, concerning the category of \u201creligion\u201d itself; and analyze religious practice within the contexts of race, gender, sexuality, and geography. Topics include the rise of modern science and its impact on evangelical Christianity; the development of liberal religion (Protestant and Catholic), American Judaism, the resurgence of mainstream evangelicalism, religious counterculture, immigration and the growth of eastern religions, American Islam, the \u201cnew atheist\u201d movement, and the rise of the Christian right.        V90.0650 \u2013Topics: Pilgrims, Tourists, and Wanderers (Sion)     This course will explore the relationship between travel and religion, from pilgrimage to the grave of saints to religious theme parks. Our wanderings will take us to sites of death (Elvis Presley, Cambodian killing fields), miracles (Virgin of Guadalupe), and entertainment ( Holy Land experience). We will pick up material souvenirs, touch relics and leave mementos of our visit. We will meet the Wandering Jew and discuss migrations of the Diaspora.
