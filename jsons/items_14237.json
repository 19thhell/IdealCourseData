A National Merit Scholar, he had his undergraduate education in engineering at IIT Madras. Subsequently, based on his undergraduate thesis, he was invited on a full scholarship to pursue his Master's degree in Engineering in U.S.A. There he was engaged in a two-year research project constructing a mathematical model of the Great Lakes Water System for the Environmental Protection Agency of the U.S. Government. Subsequently he migrated from the engineering of matter to the engineering of mind and received both his masters and doctoral degrees in Management from New York University.       Professor Kabaliswaran is a specialist in leadership and organizational design. He has had long and productive record consulting and offering workshops and seminars on leadership, strategy and structural aspects of managing large and complex organizations.

His students and workshop participants come from all the continents and have varied backgrounds and titles: C.E.O.s, doctors, lawyers, judges, accountants, scientists, engineers and Ph.D.s.       Professor Kabaliswaran is very active in the NYU Stern Executive M.B.A. program. He has previously taught at NYU a smorgasbord of management courses including hard skill courses such as Strategy and Advanced Strategy Analysis. He has also designed and rolled out several soft skill elective MBA courses such as Strategic Design, Power & Politics, and Leadership. He designed and taught ISIS (International Social Impact Strategies), an MBA elective course focusing on melding economic value creation with social value creation, the marriage of compassion with commerce.       A popular professor with students, Professor Kabaliswaran is the recipient of Great Professor award from the NYU Stern Executive MBA program. He has served as Chairman of the Departmental Leadership Committee at the NYU Stern School of Business and was a member of the Curriculum Committee that advises on course design.
