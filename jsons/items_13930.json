They will be ahead of the curve because they will have the capacity to understand and manage risk from a broad systemic and strategic perspective. Additionally, they will learn innovative modeling techniques and become equipped with a toolset that will enable them to understand how a firm\u2019s strategy and business contours drive risk exposure profiles.    The strategic capstone presented at the culmination of the program ties together the substantive content and practical case work taught throughout the year in a concrete risk analysis of the students\u2019 choosing.     Approach:  The program covers all key dimensions of risk encountered in both financial firms and in finance function of non-financial services businesses. The substantive content of the program is put into the context of both the current and prospective regulatory environment encompassing each of the main dimensions of risk.     Format:  The Master of Science in Risk Management program is a one year long, part-time program divided into five on-site class sessions (modules) at NYU Stern in New York and two rotating global locations. This part-time format reduces the absence from the office to approximately 5 weeks over the course of the year. Between modules, students complete an average of 15-20 hours per week of work via distance learning. For more information on the format, please click here .     Network:  Participants will have the opportunity to cross-learn and share best practices among current and past cohorts. Graduates will also join NYU\u2019s alumni network as they earn a single degree issued by New York University Stern School of Business.
