It may have been chosen because in years gone by violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the original university building. On the other hand, it may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, that center of learning in the ancient world, and was thus regarded as an appropriate symbol of education and knowledge.   For more than a century, NYU athletes have worn violet and white colors in competition, and have carried the resulting nickname \u2013 the Violets \u2013 with pride. While a student dressed as a violet served as the school mascot for a brief time in the 1980s, it was decided that the flower did not instill great awe or foreboding in NYU\u2019s opponents.

The seal carries the Latin motto \u201cPerstare et Praestare,\u201d which is generally translated as \u201cto persevere and to excel.\u201d   The origin of the University color, violet, is obscure. It may have been chosen because in years gone by violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the original university building. On the other hand, it may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with Athens, that center of learning in the ancient world, and was thus regarded as an appropriate symbol of education and knowledge.   For more than a century, NYU athletes have worn violet and white colors in competition, and have carried the resulting nickname \u2013 the Violets \u2013 with pride. While a student dressed as a violet served as the school mascot for a brief time in the 1980s, it was decided that the flower did not instill great awe or foreboding in NYU\u2019s opponents. A new mascot was conceived from the name of the Bobst Library card catalog, or Bobst Catalog. Today, the Bobcat mascot symbolizes both NYU\u2019s academic and athletic traditions.
