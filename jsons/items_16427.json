The producer finds the material, gathers the talent, oversees the fabrication of the work and steers it to the marketplace. It is the producer\u2019s vision that marks him or her as an artist.    An interdisciplinary producer with a firm knowledge of the craft, a discerning eye for material, fundraising ability, a grasp of the law, cash-flow, people and ethics, is rare. The Producing Minor is a specialized track designed to provide students of any major with a framework for understanding the dynamics of producing as an art form and a business profession.    The producing minor curriculum consists of no less than 18 points.  Producing and Writing in Sydney counts towards the Minor in Producing.  Producing in London counts towards the Minor in Producing.
