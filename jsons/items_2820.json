Are they indeed anchored in the sexual dynamics of the human family as argued by Freud, or are they a necessary stage in humanity\u2019s cultural formation as suggested by Girard et al (Violent Origins)? Moreover, how do biblical gender/sexual roles and the implementation of violence within them differ from those of the analogous Greco-Christian tradition and its 20th-century heir \u2013 Freudian psychoanalysis? What are the psychological and ethical implications of the differences between the biblical account of the first homicidal act (Cain and Able) and the classical Greek take on homicide in The Orestea or Oedipus Rex? These are some of the questions to be discussed in this class through a comparative close reading of selected biblical narratives and Greek myth and drama, accompanied by relevant assignments from biblical, classical Greek, and psychoanalytic scholarship; literary and feminist interpretation of the Bible; and artistic representations of biblical and classic Greek themes. The Dead Sea Scrolls, Judaism, and Christianity (HBRJD-UA 131) [Ancient/Rabbinic] Instructor: Prof. Alex Jassen Day &amp; Time: Thursday 12:30pm - 1:45pm Description: Survey of the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls for the history of early Judaism and Christianity. Reading and discussion of English translations of the major texts. Conceptions of Gender in Ancient Egypt (HBRJD-UA 138 ) [Ancient/Rabbinic] Instructor: Prof. Ann Roth Day &amp; Time: Thursday 12:30pm - 1:45pm Description: The pharaonic Egyptian culture (3100 \u2013 30 BCE) was situated geographically in an unusual agriculture zone, dependent not upon rain and irrigation, but on an annual flood that left the land fertilized and well-watered. As a result, general conceptions of fertility, and hence gender, were somewhat anomalous. This course will deal with this hypothesis, and the traditional scholarship on Egyptian gender relations and sexuality, by examining archaeological remains, artistic representations, and texts throughout the pharaonic period. Russian Jewish History (HBRJD-UA 191) [Modern] Instructor: Prof. Gennady Estraikh Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm Description: Focuses on Jewish history in imperial Russia, from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 20th. It also gives an overview of the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. Topics include the government's policies toward Jews; attempts to integrate them into the larger society; the establishment and development of Russian Jewish civil society; Jewish participation in the revolutionary movement; aspects of Jewish social, economic, and cultural life in villages, town, and cities; the role of women in family and communal life; military service; anti-Jewish violence; and emigration. Israeli Politics and Society (HBRJD-UA 710) [Modern] Instructor: TBA Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 3:30pm \u2013 4:45 pm Description: Examines the power structure and mechanisms of contemporary Israeli politics beginning with the emergence of the provisional government in 1948. Traces how Israel's national institutions, key basic bills and the legislation mechanism, and electoral system developed. The course also examines key fault lines in Israeli social, political, and economic life, including Jewish-Arab relations; the balance between the welfare state and economic liberalism; Union workers and gender relations. Readings in Talmud: Hullin VIII (in Hebrew) (HBRJD-UA 784) Instructor: Prof. Lawrence Schiffman Day &amp; Time: Tuesday 6:30pm \u2013 8:00pm Description: Studies a selected section of the Hebrew and Aramaic text of the Babylonian Talmud, utilizing both traditional and academic methods of study.\u200e Emphasis is on mastering the themes and concepts while studying the text and its commentaries in depth. CORE Courses  Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Reformation (CORE-UA 400-070) Instructor: Prof. Mark Smith Day &amp; Time: Tuesday, Thursday 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm Description: Often viewed as a series of \"Protestant\" responses to the Roman Catholic   Church, the Reformation was a period of massive religious and political   conflict. It appropriated the Bible as the single basis of   authoritative knowledge and also transformed the study of the Bible   based on the language and textual scholarship that had emerged in the   wake of the Renaissance\u2019s rediscovery of classical texts. In taking up   the Bible as well as classical learning, the Reformation posed   fundamental questions about the nature of individual persons, society,   and humanity. These issues continue to inform fundamental ideas and   conceptual categories of religion and society in Western Europe and the   United States today. Ancient Israel (CORE-UA 514-001) Instructor: Prof. Daniel Fleming Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Description: The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 BCE to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century BCE. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel (CORE-UA 537-001) Instructor: Prof. Ronald Zweig Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Description: Explores the cultural values and expressions through which residents of the modern State of Israel have tried to come to grips with the manifold challenges their country has faced since its inception in 1948. Its founders envisioned citizens would initiate extensive changes in their economic and political behavior, family life, attitudes toward their bodies, relations with their neighbors, religious outlook, and view of their place in the world, and expected that these would find concrete expression in literature, art, music, architecture, and intellectual life. But they did not anticipate the challenges of rapid mass immigration, periodic wars, shifting geopolitical alignments, transformation of the global economy, and sweeping technological innovations. We analyze these far-reaching changes in the context in which Israeli culture has functioned and investigate how that culture has responded to them, drawing on journalistic accounts, short stories, and Israeli films and television programs.

We will read and discuss Texts on different topics and various genres, practice Composition and writing, and continue the study of The Hebrew verb with an emphasis on Future Tense conjugations. Hebrew Through Film (HBJD-UA 10) Instructor: Prof. Ilona Ben-Moshe Day &amp; Time: Thursday 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm Description: An advanced language course focusing on aspects of Israeli society as they are portrayed in primarily 21st century Israeli films and television. The aspects examined include immigration and immigrants, ethnic groups within Israeli society, religious communities and their relationship to the secular world, the kibbutz , periphery vs. center, the Israeli-Arab conflict and military service. The course will foster a deeper understanding of the Hebrew language\u2019s various registers and their manifestation in different social contexts and genres. The class will strengthen the students\u2019 proficiency in the four language skills, with emphasis on listening and speaking. Students will be required to view films, to engage in pre and post-viewing activities such as reading background materials in Hebrew, to participate in class discussions, and to write in Hebrew about the films.

We are on the edge of reversing paralysis, restoring sight   to the blind and hearing to the deaf, as just a few examples. Medical universities   and research institutions are at the forefront of this race for cures, considered   nothing short of miracles, just a mere 10 years ago, and now part of everyday   reality.     Within the last 4 weeks, a gravely ill cardiac patient received a mechanical   heart transplant, is off the ventilator, talking, and up and walking, albeit   with assistance. Although his doctors are not expecting this device to prolong   his life more than 30 days, he is doing better than anticipated (&quot;Mechanical   Heart Patient Walks without Assistance&quot;). Stem cell research is currently   being debated in Congress and even a staunch &quot;Pro-Life&quot; legislator   recognizes the promise that this research holds for renewed and extended life,   not to mention creating new life (&quot;Senator Bill Frist Offers Support to   Federal Funding of Stem Cell Research&quot;).     Fall-out from this flurry of technological, medical and scientific advances   poses a serious threat to religious communities worldwide. Ethical, religious   and spiritual questions, being raised to religious leaders, require answers   to questions that have ever been raised before. The very foundation of religious   beliefs can be shaken and has the potential to destroy and/or radically change   every religion on earth   .   The Jewish religious response and the steadfastness of their positions and beliefs   are what I will be exploring in the context of this paper. How can Judaism survive   the onslaught of its potential destruction by this bio-technical revolution?   I hold that the rabbinical body can address every inquiry based on principles   developed throughout the centuries and will stand the test of time, while re-examing   and confirming their strong beliefs, based upon the teachings of the Torah.   An attempt will be made to include the position of three major Jewish sects:   Orthodox, Conservative and Reformed. If possible, I will be also presenting   the Hasidic stance.     Methods that I will be using include responsums (answers) based on halaka (jewish   law) and its interpretations, found through various religious sites on the internet,   texts on the Jewish religion and interpretation of the Jewish law. I am also   anticipating an interview with a rabbi. Also included are texts based on biotech   and technical breakthroughs and predictions.   Thesis: Judaism will survive despite its increasing vulnerability due to the   emergence of extraordinary biotechnical advancements in America.     Definitions:   halakah, halakha &#151; law (Hebrew and Jewish spellings respectively);   right path     Pentateuch &#151; The first five books of the Hebrew Scriptures (The American   Heritage Dictionary).     pikuah nefesh &#151; Duty to save life of person in mortal danger (Prouser).   stem cells - &quot;After an egg is fertilized, it begins to divide. When it   reaches the 140-cell stage, there are a few cells in the middle of the ball   that hang down like a little chandelier. These are stem cells.&quot;     responsum &#151; Answer to a religious question     Talmud &#151; Hebrew for study or learning; the collection of ancient   rabbinic writings consisting of the Mishnah and the Gemara, constituting the   basis for religious authority in Orthodox Judaism (The American Heritage Dictionary).     Torah &#151; Hebrew, for &#145;teaching, instruction&#146;; in general,   Torah refers to study of the whole gamut of Jewish tradition or to some aspect   thereof. In its special sense, &#145;the Torah&#146; refers to the &#145;five   books of Moses&#146; in the Hebrew Scriptures (Robinson 595).      Looking Back   The Jewish people have existed throughout the centuries, despite plagues, wars,   the Spanish Inquisition, Pogroms, and The Holocaust, just to name a few. They   have developed an uncanny ability to survive throughout the ages and have mastered,   at least up until now, the ability to overcome severe persecution and impending   threats of extinction (Dimont 15).     The Jews are a people, extremely small in number, with a current worldwide population   of only 14 million, a drop in the bucket, compared to world population figures   of about 6 billion (The Jewish Population of the World and World Population).   So one could see that if the Nazis were not stopped, in their death march upon   the Jews, which had already been responsible for the eradication of 6,000,000,   that the probability of Jews coming at least close to total annihilation would   have been fairly certain.     Not having the luxury of being popular among the masses, for most of their existence,   the Jews have been enslaved, persecuted, ostracized, denied basic human rights,   condemned to death, targeted for total destruction, and in others words not   very welcome in the world. Any early prediction of their fate would have certainly   been grim, based on how the world has always treated those of the Jewish faith.   But no, not the Jews, although their path was paved with extreme struggle and   hardship, while mighty civilizations disappeared, some leaving only vestiges   of their existence, they not only strengthened their ability to survive at all   costs, but continued to flourish throughout the centuries. Despite this dreadful   treatment, the Jews survived and outlived other popular civilizations, and have   made their mark in the world by great accomplishments and have excelled in the   arts, music, medicine, law, science, education, government, business, and every   other worthwhile human endeavor (Dimont 15-16). In many instances Jews forged   new territory and lead the way for others. Some of humanities greatest contributors,   such as Einstein, Freud, Jonas Salk, Leonard Bernstein, George Gershwin, Irving   Berlin, Arthur Miller, Stephen Spielberg, Barbara Streisand and Neil Simon are   a few examples of Jews who have made their impact on society and our culture   (Dimont 14).     So how can such an inconsequential group of people, survive annihilation, rise   to the forefront of the human experience and make such a difference in the world?   In the following I will endeavor to explore some of the more reasons.     Since their emergence, as a people, the Jews did not have the benefit of a nation   of their own, until State of Israel was established in 1948. Vulnerable to conquest,   the Jews often losing battles were divided by the victors and forced to leave   their homes and were sent to all parts of the world. Also driven by persecution,   they left to parts afar to set-up life anew and, in many some cases, actually   prosper throughout the world. This scattering throughout the world is known   as Diaspora. Although being banned from Judaic practice and struggling through   the political and anti-Semitic crusades, the mere fact that they were living   in Diaspora, dwelling in separate lands protected them as an entire group. For   you see, if one area was under extreme threat, for example in Western Europe   during the Holocaust, other groups of Jews existed throughout the world that   was not threatened or otherwise imminently endangered. Of course however, taking   the case of the Holocaust, if Hitler was not stopped and if he stayed on his   course to world domination, while continuing his path of total destruction of   the Jews, this probably would have eradicated the Jews forever. This time in   Jewish history was probably the closest to total extinction of the race.     Having had this history of survival, this in fact created a self-fulfilling   prophecy, as Jews expected to deal with their very survival on a day&#151;to&#151;day   basis. As a result they used every means necessary to survive, remaining diligent   and alert to threats to existence, which they also knew was always hanging in   the balance. As an example, &quot;&#133;American Jewry has over the years built   up an arsenal of ideologies and institutions and has personnel motivated and   trained to stand up to the challenge of survival&quot; (Karp 264).     In addition Jews have been conditioned to adapt to new cultures, thoughts and   Karp in quoting Robert Gordis, &#145;The evolving character of Judaism: Judaism   has never been static; it has always adapted itself to new thought and new conditions&#133;&#146;   (Karp 240).     There certainly are many other reasons to explore in attributing this extraordinary   feat of surviving the centuries, but not within the confines of this analysis.   I would, however, like to add an opinion of my to this. When constantly under   threat one recognizes the stakes and when your very existence is being threatened   because of your beliefs, you are strengthened in defending your right to have   those beliefs and therefore the very threat to survival causes religious inquiry,   debate and can strengthen and reinforce your faith.     Practice of the Religion   Coupling this history of survival, with the strength and belief in Judaism&#146;s   principles and doctrines, have been used as a steady guide for over 5000 years   to navigate the Jewish people through severe storms. Devotion to the correctness   of G-d&#146;s word has marshaled their forces and uplifted their spirits and   has provided guidance for life&#146;s encounters, no matter how contemporary   and unique these issues might be. Even In these modern times, the Talmudic law   is used to interpret problems in the same way that it was used thousands of   years ago. There is no situation that cannot be addressed and resolved by application   of halakah (Broyd 1, Dimont 168-181).     Facing New Challenges   Today, we, in the 21st Century, are teetering on the brink of incredible medical   and biotechnical advancements. The threat to Judaism, and in fact, to all existing   religions are very real. Currently it looks like there will be only one winner:   religion or science and it appears that technology will wear the blue ribbon   (Kurzweil 150-151). In the midst of this revolutionary period is the Jewish   religion, standing tall and facing these new age challenges, one by one. On   this road, there is no turning back, and the Jewish leaders cannot help to know   this (B&#146;Or Ha&#146;Torah).      Revision of Thesis   To address individual Jewish sects and their response to these challenges, as   well as to cover the scope of the new advances, has turned into a feat that   needs to be covered in a much broader format, requiring more extensive work   than what can be covered in the confines of this assignment. Therefore, I have   modified the original position as expressed in the abstract, to focus on cloning,   stem cell research and how this challenges Judaism and its roots, without attention   to particular sects.     Jews and Medical Ethics   In an effort to present   the flavor of the Jewish mind set with regard to medical ethical questions,   you must understand that the established Judaic laws, which existed for thousands   of years, are still being consulted for life solutions and have remained a constant   source of guidance in all circumstances, even in these modern times, which is   illustrated by both of the following excerpts (Dimont 168-181):        The inestimable   value of human life is a cardinal principle of Jewish Law.   This principle includes an obligation for maintenance of our own health   and for self-preservation. This obligation, known as pikuah nefesh, also   includes the duty to save the life of one&#146;s fellow human being, should   he or she be in mortal danger.   This is the significance of the Command&#145;You shall not stand idly by the   blood of your neighbor&#146; (Lev 19:16)&#146; (Prouser 1), and      Although the term Jewish Medical Ethics first came into use in the 1950&#146;s,   and the popular interest is a recent phenomenon, their relevance and acceptance   has been part of the fabric of the Jewish people since Sinai. Rabbinical rulings   dealing with health and medicine, based on the commandments in the Pentateuch   and their elaboration in the Talmud and codes of Jewish law, have come down   to us over the centuries, and new ones are issued every year. The collection   of such rabbinical rulings is known as halakha &#151; right path. Halakha   is a dynamic and ongoing process covering all aspects of life. It is not derived   by philosophic speculation about contrived situations. This is why most Jewish   medical ethicists emphasize the doctor-patient relationship; most of the questions   presented for adjudication belong to this category. (Greene)       When addressing issues on organ donation Rabbi Prouser states:   &#133;we are obligated   to preserve life. We ought not, as our final act, glorify strictly subjective   aversions, aesthetic objections, and personal preference at the expense of human   life. As in many areas of human endeavor and religious expression, we serve   G-d by appropriately identifying our priorities and acting accordingly. As Rabbi   Jerome Epstein has taught us, a Conservative Jew &#145;employs learned Jewish   values to guide behavior even when it conflicts with personal feeling or inclination&#146;   (Prouser 3).   Prouser goes on   to say, that the act of withholding the organs of the deceased, when it&#146;s   needed to save a life, is forbidden by Jewish law and that the act of organ   donation, to save a life, is considered a good deed and does honor to the deceased   party (Prouser 3-4).     From these statements I have concluded that the Jewish position favors saving   existing life and in fact it states it&#146;s our obligation to do so. Therefore   one would conclude that if the means to save a life is legal, in terms of Judaic   law and rabbinical approval, the use of human organs, parts, cloned cells, stem   cells is not only permitted but encouraged.     Cloning and the Jewish Response   Aside from tales of horror and terror, such as the possibility of exact duplicates   of us being created or younger halves of twins running through the world in   abandon, there are very real possibilities for the use of cloning as the salvation   of many medical and survival problems today. Scientists are at the tip of the   iceberg in discovering the possibilities of curing terrible diseases and prolonging   life. As an example, &quot;Israeli researchers said they have succeeded in coaxing   human embryonic stem cells into producing the hormone insulin in a key step   toward creating a revolutionary treatment for Type 1 Diabetes (Bioethics Online).     Every passage, that I read, written by Jewish scholars or Rabbis, questions   of ethics and morality, refer the questions back to the &quot;eyes of the Jewish   law&quot; (Broyde 1). According to Jewish law reproductive technology is neither   allowed nor prohibited and each case must be analyzed separately (Broyde 1).   Rather than have   a pat, predetermined response, to each of these issues, the approach to halakah   enables Jewish leaders to have the opportunity to address questions, such as   these, with a fresh set of eyes, as each question must be answered separately,   while still applying ancient Jewish laws to questions of the 21st Century. In   his paper on Cloning, Broyde asserts, &quot;Like all preliminary analysis, it   is designed not to advance a rule that represents itself as definitive normative   Jewish law; rather it is an attempt to outline some of the issues in the hope   that others will focus on the problems and analysis found in this paper and   will sharpen or correct that analysis. Such is the way that Jewish law seeks   truth&quot; (Broyde 1). The ability to address questions individually, and hopefully,   without bias allows flexibility in the response, while maintaining the integrity   of the religion. Perhaps, this allows the review of these issues in ever-changing   times to keep the religion fresh and responsive to these new challenges. It   is interesting to note that Halakah allows the use of stems cell from an early   embryo. The church however, &quot;forced the US government to prohibit the use   of stem cells from an embryo at the (early) 140-cell stage&quot; (Tendler, Moshe   6).     It&#146;s important to note that &quot;Judaism does not believe that personhood   and human rights begin with conception&quot; (United Synagogue Resolution of   Abortion). This is in direct contrast with the Catholic Religion. Nevertheless,   Judaism does not condone abortion for contraceptive reasons, but &quot;under   special circumstances, Judaism chooses and requires abortion as an act that   protects the life, well being and health of the mother&quot; (United Synagogue   Resolution&#133;),&quot;or when the fetus is judged by competent medical opinion   severely defective&quot; (Blumenthal). &quot;While Judaism sees the fetus as   valuble and sacred as potential life, the sources indicate that it is not equivalent   to a person (Blumenthal). Judaism also gives parents the right to have children   and does not deny invitro fertilization, as having children is a blessing (Dorff).       The preceding information is quite relevant to the stem cell issues as stem   cells can be obtained from fetuses (Tendler, Moshe 6). It follows that the aborted   fetuses and the fertilized cells which go unused for invitro fertilization can   be then used to get stem cells, and as long as the fetus is in the early stage   (approximately under 40 days old) old, the Jewish position permits its use (United   Synagogue &#151; Abortion Controversy 2). In fact Jewish law mandates its use   since as stated earlier it is a sin to not help another person survive. If survival   means donating stem cells to help someone heal their heart, lungs, kidneys,   and so forth, and prolong their life, it must be done as long as it does not   fall in the face of existing Judaic law (Prouser 3-4).     Conclusion   On the other hand one cannot make the mistake and think that the law can be   twisted and bent to make people happy. It just doesn&#146;t work that way.     Rabbi Shafran makes an interesting point in his deliberation of the complex   questions that arise out of contemporary medical issues. He poses questions   such as &quot;Is it proper to experiment on fertilized human eggs that remain   after infertility treatments?&quot; He recognizes that these questions will   keep on coming and as always, Jewish religious scholars will consult the Halakah   in these matters. But, he goes on to say that &quot;we simple Jews who are far   from expert in halakha stand to gain much from   pondering current medical ethics issues &#151; not only because they are fascinating   but because they are a reminder.&quot; A reminder of what, you ask? A reminder   that G-d has created billions of these miracles of creating life everyday and   that the true miracle is the working of our bodies and the debt that we owe   to our creator (Shafran 1).     The Torah is a profound teacher, teaching us about ourselves, how we relate   to one another, G-d and what we perceive to be realty. As individuals we want   to do what we please and are challenged as individuals and by society, it&#146;s   our mission to channel this passion to devotion and service to G-d and his commandments   (Tendler, Aron).   &quot;Israel Freidlander   offers guidance for a creative vision of the future of American Jewry:&quot;     &#145;There   is an old rabbinic saying that after the destruction of the Temple the gift   of prophecy passed over to children and fools. True, prophecy without inspiration,   which predicts the future as a matter of fact, is childish and foolish, because   no human eye can perceive and no human mind can calculate the innumerable   and imponderable effects of the concatenation of human events. But prophecy   as a matter of hope, the prediction of future not as it will be, but as it   ought to be, is indispensable for all who have, or desire to have, a clear   conception of their duties towards the coming generations.&#146; (Karp 26)       Perhaps other religions will look at these scenarios and refuse to admit that   our times are such. Naturally this kind of thinking will only create the eventual   downfall of those beliefs, but Judaism does, in fact, give answers, very carefully   considered answers, with an approach that has been developed throughout the   history of Judaism, as I have discussed in this treatment. Scholars pour over   Judaic doctrine to examine and re-examine these issues. These answers are not   always what people would like to hear. Their beliefs are strong and steadfast   in what they believe G-d has in mind for the inhabitants of the world, keeping   in mind that these old laws and doctrines, do plan for the end of the world   (Ciner 1).     They are able to address these questions in many cases more in concert with   scientific breakthroughs than I have anticipated. However, I&#146;ve discovered   that their answers are not always what people would like to hear. So I must   state that the Judaism too can disappear along with the others religions, in   opposition to what I had originally stated. Judaism too can be vulnerable to   extinction once followers do not want to hear what the interpretation of G-d&#146;s   wishes and should that conflict with modern technology.     It strikes this writer that this Jewish position, of understanding the healing   benefit of using stem cells, is in concert with the bio-medical world, and leads   one to conclude that a religion so dedicated to rational thinking and the protection   of people, is flexible therefore fostering it&#146;s own survival, as the world   culture continues to face the challenges set upon it by technology. The questions   of how the Jewish religion will handle more radical breakthroughs such as artificial   intelligence, brain implants, totaling cloned new beings and other possibilities   will further challenge the religion and may in fact cause it&#146;s downfall.   However my own personal belief is that the Judaic scholars will be able to weather   this storm, although I cannot speak to the future, for certainly what is anticipated   will be quite extraordinary and will make science fiction into science reality.
