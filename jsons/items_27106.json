The best engineers are adept not only at managing employees and technology but also at optimizing the organization of a business.   That&rsquo;s why, at the School of Engineering, we ask our students to take the unique approach of examining relationships rather than components. The MS in Industrial Engineering program teaches you to search for similarities in concepts, laws, and models across disciplines. From there, it&rsquo;s up to you to adapt, integrate, and exploit these similarities in innovative ways.   Because industrial engineers often work on multidisciplinary teams, we offer an elective-heavy curriculum. That approach lets you build expertise in whichever subjects best fit your career interests. These specialties include:      mechanical engineering    manufacturing    operations management    construction management    management of technology    electrical engineering     Admission Requirements   You must hold a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in a related discipline from an accredited institution and be able to demonstrate a superior undergraduate academic record. Applicants who do not meet these requirements are considered individually for admission and may be admitted subject to their completion of courses to remove deficiencies. Candidates are encouraged to seek waivers (and have approved substitutes designated) for all required courses in which they can demonstrate competence, thereby using their time effectively.   You must also have knowledge of engineering economics and probability and statistics. Prospective students lacking the relevant knowledge may satisfy the requirement by taking probability and statistics (MA 6513 or equivalent). Up to 3 credits of graduate courses in this category of prerequisite knowledge can be counted toward the degree as electives, although the electives needed for your concentration also must be satisfied.

The best engineers are adept not only at managing employees and technology but also at optimizing the organization of a business.   That&rsquo;s why, at the School of Engineering, we ask our students to take the unique approach of examining relationships rather than components. The MS in Industrial Engineering program teaches you to search for similarities in concepts, laws, and models across disciplines. From there, it&rsquo;s up to you to adapt, integrate, and exploit these similarities in innovative ways.   Because industrial engineers often work on multidisciplinary teams, we offer an elective-heavy curriculum. That approach lets you build expertise in whichever subjects best fit your career interests. These specialties include:      mechanical engineering    manufacturing    operations management    construction management    management of technology    electrical engineering     Admission Requirements   You must hold a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in a related discipline from an accredited institution and be able to demonstrate a superior undergraduate academic record. Applicants who do not meet these requirements are considered individually for admission and may be admitted subject to their completion of courses to remove deficiencies. Candidates are encouraged to seek waivers (and have approved substitutes designated) for all required courses in which they can demonstrate competence, thereby using their time effectively.   You must also have knowledge of engineering economics and probability and statistics. Prospective students lacking the relevant knowledge may satisfy the requirement by taking probability and statistics (MA 6513 or equivalent). Up to 3 credits of graduate courses in this category of prerequisite knowledge can be counted toward the degree as electives, although the electives needed for your concentration also must be satisfied.

Required Core Courses (12 Credits)   3.00 Credits Quality Control and Improvement IE-GY 6113 This course provides students with a solid foundation in the cost of quality, quality assurance and quality management. Emphasis is on the basic tools of quality control such as control charts and their use, the concept of \u201cout of control,\u201d acceptance sampling, variables and attributes charts and producer\u2019s and consumer\u2019s risk. A unique aspect of this course is the demonstration of the power of teams of people with different expertise to improve quality. A course project is required. Prerequisite: MA-GY 6513 or familiarity with the concepts of probability and statistics. Also listed under MN-GY 6113. 3.00 Credits Facility Planning and Design IE-GY 6213 Topics in this course include facilities design for global competitiveness, strategic master-site planning, site selection, factory layout and design, facility-management systems and materials handling and storage planning. Also presented are guidance on selecting alternative facility plans and application of queuing methods and computer modeling for facility design and evaluation. 3.00 Credits Factory Simulation IE-GY 6823 This course examines modeling and simulation of complex industrial, commercial and service systems, such as factories and hospitals. Students develop, run and test several simulation models using different software packages. Prerequisite: Computer literacy. 3.00 Credits Production Science MN-GY 7893 This course reviews just-in-time and synchronous manufacturing methods. It analyzes the basic dynamics of factories to understand the importance of congestion and bottleneck rates on cycle time and inventories. Analytical models are developed to study variability and randomness introduced by breakdown, setups and batching. Simulation studies are used to provide data on performance of transfer lines.   Electives and Other Courses (18 Credits)   You must take 3 electives from manufacturing or industrial engineering for a total of 9 credits. An additional 3 electives are taken from any other graduate curriculum with the approval of the Program Director to ensure their compatibility with your professional objectives for the remaining 9 credits that are needed to fulfill the degree requirements.    You should elect other courses in consultation with your adviser. Concentrations in areas suited to your career interests are encouraged (e.g., manufacturing, mechanical engineering, operations management, construction management, and management of technology). Courses from computer science or management may supplement such a concentration.
