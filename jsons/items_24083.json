Most students take advantage of New York&rsquo;s vast public transportation   system while studying at NYU. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority&rsquo;s   (MTA) website has information about available subways, buses, and trains, including   maps and relevant schedules ( www.mta.info ). NYU also provides shuttle   and trolley services between all dorms and major education centers throughout   the city. For more information about these services, visit the campus transportation   section of NYU&rsquo;s Office of Public Transportation ( www.nyu.edu/public.safety/transportation ).             What are the housing options available for students?   While on-campus graduate student housing is available, it remains very limited.   The Off Campus Housing Office assists students in finding accommodations outside   of the University ( www.nyu.edu/housing/offcampus ).   A variety of other lists are also available to students in need of housing   in New York, including the Village Voice ( www.villagevoice.com ),   Craigslists ( newyork.craigslist.org ), and The New York Times ( nytimes.com/pages/realestate ).   For more information about housing options, visit NYU&rsquo;s Department of   Housing ( www.nyu.edu/housing ).             Do I need health insurance? Where can I get it?   All graduate students are required to have health insurance. NYU offers a range   of health insurance plans, depending on students&rsquo; needs and credit load.   If you have health insurance from another company or organization outside of   NYU, you may opt out of the university plan. For more information, visit the   Student Health Center&rsquo;s health insurance webpage ( www.nyu.edu/shc/about/insurance.html ).          How much does the program cost?   Costs for the program are on a per-credit basis, plus basic registration fees.   In general, cost per credit is reduced slightly as credit load increases. For   current cost structures, visit www.nyu.edu/bursar/tuition.fees/ .   Additional information is available at NYU&rsquo;s Office of the Bursar ( www.nyu.edu/bursar ).          How long does it take a typical student to complete the master's program?   Most graduate Food Studies students attend part-time and take between 2 and 3 years to complete the degree. Full-time students can complete the program faster, but we do not recommend this. Students get more out of the program and receive stronger job opportunities by enrolling only part-time and working/interning while studying.          How many students are in the classes?   We limit most classes to 25 students; however seminar, writing, and research classes are often smaller.          What is the average age of the students?   Students range in age from recent college graduates to retirees. Most students are in their late twenties.          Does the Food Studies graduate program require an internship? When should I do it?   We strongly urge all Food Studies students to pursue as many internships as possible during their graduate career. We maintain an email list serve for all currently enrolled graduate students, where we continually post notices regarding internship and job opportunities. We recommend that students pursue different positions each semester.          What if I'm interested in both food and nutrition (or public health)? Is there a joint degree?   No joint graduate degrees are allowed at NYU. However, students have many opportunities to take nutrition and public health courses within the Department. Students can also take classes across Steinhardt and, with permission from advisor and professor, from academic departments in other schools at NYU.          What are the two specialization tracks?   In brief, the two specializations are: FOOD CULTURE, which examines the social, economic, cultural, and psychological factors that have influenced food consumption practices and patterns in the past and present. Students research historical, sociological and anthropological aspects of food. FOOD SYSTEMS, which explores the food systems, tracing commodities and agricultural concerns from production through consumption. Emphasizing international, national and local food systems, students explore environmental, ethical, and economic factors in food production and distribution.          Is there a strict curriculum, or do I choose my own classes?   The Food Studies curriculum is broken down into three categories &ndash; core requirements, concentration requirements, and electives. For additional information about requirements, see section below on core classes.          What kind of job can I get when I graduate?   Food Studies graduates find jobs in all areas within the food industry.    FOOD CULTURE    Food Culture graduates find jobs within 5 broad categories:       Publishing (magazines, newspapers, online sources)     Public relations (restaurants, food lobby groups, cookbooks, food    &bull; organizations)    Marketing (for restaurants, celebrity chefs, cookbooks, organizations)    Nonprofit work (education, food/hunger advocacy groups)     Food operations (wine importers/distributors, restaurants, retail)       FOOD SYSTEMS    For graduates of Food Systems, common job categories include:       Local   and national governmental (city government, federal government, food regulations,   relations between industry and government)    NGO work in advocacy and policy (farming, labor, food scarcity,   trade)    Development organizations (community building, national programs, international   trade and aid organizations)    Food production companies (producers and manufacturers of food   items)    Food distribution companies (importation, transportation, and retail)             How do I register? When do I register?   Each semester, you need to make an appointment with a graduate advisor. These appointments may be in person or over the phone. Prior to the appointment, you should pre-select classes and make a list of pertinent questions. Students in their first semester meet three times as a group in New Student Seminar. We devote one of these sessions to advising.          What percentage of applicants receive acceptance into Food Studies?   All applicants will be considered for admission. Successful candidates typically have a strong undergraduate GPA, an up-to-date resume, and a well-crafted essay with goals and motivations that are in line with those of the program and department. Relevant experience in the food profession, while not required is helpful and strongly encouraged.          Are there informational sessions offered?   We offer 2-hour information sessions every month. You can sign up for one on our website.          How many credits do I need to graduate?   The Food Studies degree is 40 credits.          How many students are in the graduate Food Studies program?   At any given time, approximately 160 students (full or part-time) are enrolled in the Food Studies program. An average of 60 students matriculate each year.          Does the Department offer any study abroad opportunities?   NYU operates a number of campuses and maintains relationships with other universities around the world, thus providing students with a variety of study abroad opportunities. Many departments offer courses in these locations throughout the year. The Study Abroad office has more information about these options ( steinhardt.nyu.edu/study_abroad ). The Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health regularly offers courses abroad.    The Food Studies Department offers courses in Pueblo, Mexico, Hong Kong, Paris, Florence and in depth course sites in the United States.          Is it possible to visit classes?   Unfortunately, the University does not allow prospective students to sit in on a class.          How do I get an ID card?   Student IDs are available at the NYU Card Center (383 Lafayette St.), Tel: 212-443-2273. For more information, visit http://www.nyu.edu/nyucard/about/how.obtain.nyucard.html          How do I apply for scholarships?   School-based scholarship consideration is available to full-time and part-time applicants who submt a FAFSA by February 1 for the Fall Semester and October 1 for the Spring Semester. Learn more about the process and the financial aid available at NYU Steinhardt at http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/financial_aid .    Many outside organizations offer scholarships for graduate students. Listings for some of these can be found on our Resources page, but we encourage students to search elsewhere for funding opportunities, as many available options are not posted. Be certain to check the organization's website for application deadlines.          How do I find out about financial aid?   To be considered for any type of financial aid (including scholarships and student loans), applicants must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as FAFSA (www.fafsa.ed.gov). In order to qualify for full-time financial aid, you must be taking at least 12 credits. Part-time students must take a minimun of 6 credits. Learn more about the process and the financial aid available at NYU Steinhardt at http:// steinhardt.nyu.edu/financial_aid .           How long does it take to hear from graduate admissions?   The admission process is coordinated through the Office of Graduate Admission. Applicants generally hear from graduate admissions withint six to eight weeks of having a completed application. During the review months following application deadlines, the process may take longer. Please be advised that there is no way for the Department to track the status of an application.          Should I go part-time or full-time?   We highly recommend that students attend part-time. By pursuing related jobs and internship opportunities while in school, we believe that students get more out of the program and have stronger job prospects upon completion. However, in certain circumstances, a full-time commitment makes more sense for some students. We suggest discussing the options with a Food Studies advisor. For financial aid purposes, part-time means 6 credits and full-time means 12 or more credits per semester.          How do I find out about what classes are offered?   For up-to-date information, see the NYU course schedule ( www.nyu.edu/registrar/listings ) and individual departments&rsquo; course schedules, which are usually linked through department websites.    For the schedule and descriptions of courses offered through the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, please visit steinhardt.nyu.edu/nutrition/courses .          What are the core classes? What are the concentration requirements?   All students are required to take five core classes and two research classes. They must also take four additional classes within their area of concentration &ndash; Food Systems or Food Culture. Substitutions may be permitted after consultation with a Food Studies advisor. For additional information about requirements, see the curriculum summary .          May I enroll in courses outside the Department, Steinhardt and beyond NYU?   Students may enroll in most classes offered through Steinhardt without special permission. For classes in other schools at NYU, students need to get advanced approval from a Food Sudies advisor within our department and permission from the professor of the course and his/her home department. Courses in other universities require both advanced permission from a Department advisor and permission from the other institution. In addition, an official transcript must be sent to the Department upon completion of the course.          What if I went to culinary school? Do I take fewer classes? Am I exempt from any classes?   No.          I've taken graduate courses at another University, do those credits transfer over?   If you have taken graduate level classes, that did not serve towards another degree, at another university within the past 10 years and received a B or higher, you may receive advanced standing when you matriculate. The courses must be approved by a Food Studies advisor.          What prerequisite courses are there?   There are no prerequisites.          Do I need a culinary degree?   While we do not require that students hold a culinary degree, we certainly value the accomplishment.          Are GREs required?   As of now, we do not require that students take the GREs. If you have already taken the exam and earned a high score, please feel free to include it in your application.          Can I receive credit for participating in an internship?   We urge students to pursue internships while in the program. However, there is no graduate internship course through which students receive credit. On rare occasions, if the organization demands that a student receive credit, then pending advisor approval, he/she may register and pay for a one-credit independent study.          Where can I find the syllabi set for the core classes?   Syllabi change yearly to reflect the most recent developments and literature in the field. Samples of syllabi from recent years are available for your reference:       FOOD-GE 2191 Food and Culture    FOOD-GE 2017 Contemporary Issues in Food Studies    FOOD-GE 2012 Food History    FOOD-GE 2033 Food Systems    FOOD-GE 2034 Food Systems: Advanced Topics                                          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

Next Video &gt;&gt;         Global Programs          Who we are    Food Studies at NYU is one of the first master&rsquo;s degree programs in the U.S. devoted to food scholarship. Employing approaches from the humanities and social sciences, the program prepares students to analyze the current American food system, its global connections, and local alternatives. The program examines cultural, political, economic, environmental, and geographic approaches to food within local, urban and global contexts.    The MA in Food Studies requires 19 credits in mandatory coursework that covers food systems, culture, and policy, as well as a research component. Beyond these requirements, students can take 21 credits in specialization modules (policy/advocacy, business/social entrepreneurship, media/cultural analysis) to dig deeper into their interests. Our mission is to examine the ways in which individuals, communities, and societies produce, distribute, and consume food. Cities at the center of flows of people, produce, and media products, are the prime locus of our investigations.    Why NYU Food Studies?       Learn from the best. Our faculty , prominent leaders in their field, teach and mentor students, while actively conducting research to stay engaged.    Get insider access. Upon enrolling, students study with food professionals who serve as adjuncts and guest lecturers and are welcomed by food production companies, non-profit food organizations, publishers, public relations and marketing firms, magazines, food distributors, food producers and educational institutions.    Study abroad. We now offer coursework --and a program of study--in global sites like Paris, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Puebla, for students to gain an immersive experience in an international context.    Be challenged . Students learn experientially, taking core and specialization courses, as well as interdisciplinary electives within Steinhardt, Stern School of Business, Wagner School of Public Service, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or Tisch School of the Arts.    Get ahead. We help students find internships in an array of potential employment sites and place them in positions where they can develop new skills and collaborate with potential employers.    Gain practical skills . The program places an emphasis on the development of critical thinking and research which prepares students for situations they will encounter in the profession.       What you'll learn    Upon completion of our program, students will be able to:       Apply an interdisciplinary approach to understand the cultural, political, and economic aspects of the food system.    Demonstrate their knowledge to discuss with fluency issues related to food sovereignty, sustainability, ethics and culture.    Assess policies that shape the food landscape, addressing questions of equity and preserving cultural values.    Launch and develop careers in policy; advocacy; media, social, and cultural analysis; academia; business and social entrepreneurship; and research.

Most students take advantage of New York&rsquo;s vast public transportation   system while studying at NYU. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority&rsquo;s   (MTA) website has information about available subways, buses, and trains, including   maps and relevant schedules ( www.mta.info ). NYU also provides shuttle   and trolley services between all dorms and major education centers throughout   the city. For more information about these services, visit the campus transportation   section of NYU&rsquo;s Office of Public Transportation ( www.nyu.edu/public.safety/transportation ).             What are the housing options available for students?   While on-campus graduate student housing is available, it remains very limited.   The Off Campus Housing Office assists students in finding accommodations outside   of the University ( www.nyu.edu/housing/offcampus ).   A variety of other lists are also available to students in need of housing   in New York, including the Village Voice ( www.villagevoice.com ),   Craigslists ( newyork.craigslist.org ), and The New York Times ( nytimes.com/pages/realestate ).   For more information about housing options, visit NYU&rsquo;s Department of   Housing ( www.nyu.edu/housing ).             Do I need health insurance? Where can I get it?   All graduate students are required to have health insurance. NYU offers a range   of health insurance plans, depending on students&rsquo; needs and credit load.   If you have health insurance from another company or organization outside of   NYU, you may opt out of the university plan. For more information, visit the   Student Health Center&rsquo;s health insurance webpage ( www.nyu.edu/shc/about/insurance.html ).          How much does the program cost?   Costs for the program are on a per-credit basis, plus basic registration fees.   In general, cost per credit is reduced slightly as credit load increases. For   current cost structures, visit www.nyu.edu/bursar/tuition.fees/ .   Additional information is available at NYU&rsquo;s Office of the Bursar ( www.nyu.edu/bursar ).          How long does it take a typical student to complete the master's program?   Most graduate Food Studies students attend part-time and take between 2 and 3 years to complete the degree. Full-time students can complete the program faster, but we do not recommend this. Students get more out of the program and receive stronger job opportunities by enrolling only part-time and working/interning while studying.          How many students are in the classes?   We limit most classes to 25 students; however seminar, writing, and research classes are often smaller.          What is the average age of the students?   Students range in age from recent college graduates to retirees. Most students are in their late twenties.          Does the Food Studies graduate program require an internship? When should I do it?   We strongly urge all Food Studies students to pursue as many internships as possible during their graduate career. We maintain an email list serve for all currently enrolled graduate students, where we continually post notices regarding internship and job opportunities. We recommend that students pursue different positions each semester.          What if I'm interested in both food and nutrition (or public health)? Is there a joint degree?   No joint graduate degrees are allowed at NYU. However, students have many opportunities to take nutrition and public health courses within the Department. Students can also take classes across Steinhardt and, with permission from advisor and professor, from academic departments in other schools at NYU.          What are the two specialization tracks?   In brief, the two specializations are: FOOD CULTURE, which examines the social, economic, cultural, and psychological factors that have influenced food consumption practices and patterns in the past and present. Students research historical, sociological and anthropological aspects of food. FOOD SYSTEMS, which explores the food systems, tracing commodities and agricultural concerns from production through consumption. Emphasizing international, national and local food systems, students explore environmental, ethical, and economic factors in food production and distribution.          Is there a strict curriculum, or do I choose my own classes?   The Food Studies curriculum is broken down into three categories &ndash; core requirements, concentration requirements, and electives. For additional information about requirements, see section below on core classes.          What kind of job can I get when I graduate?   Food Studies graduates find jobs in all areas within the food industry.    FOOD CULTURE    Food Culture graduates find jobs within 5 broad categories:       Publishing (magazines, newspapers, online sources)     Public relations (restaurants, food lobby groups, cookbooks, food    &bull; organizations)    Marketing (for restaurants, celebrity chefs, cookbooks, organizations)    Nonprofit work (education, food/hunger advocacy groups)     Food operations (wine importers/distributors, restaurants, retail)       FOOD SYSTEMS    For graduates of Food Systems, common job categories include:       Local   and national governmental (city government, federal government, food regulations,   relations between industry and government)    NGO work in advocacy and policy (farming, labor, food scarcity,   trade)    Development organizations (community building, national programs, international   trade and aid organizations)    Food production companies (producers and manufacturers of food   items)    Food distribution companies (importation, transportation, and retail)             How do I register? When do I register?   Each semester, you need to make an appointment with a graduate advisor. These appointments may be in person or over the phone. Prior to the appointment, you should pre-select classes and make a list of pertinent questions. Students in their first semester meet three times as a group in New Student Seminar. We devote one of these sessions to advising.          What percentage of applicants receive acceptance into Food Studies?   All applicants will be considered for admission. Successful candidates typically have a strong undergraduate GPA, an up-to-date resume, and a well-crafted essay with goals and motivations that are in line with those of the program and department. Relevant experience in the food profession, while not required is helpful and strongly encouraged.          Are there informational sessions offered?   We offer 2-hour information sessions every month. You can sign up for one on our website.          How many credits do I need to graduate?   The Food Studies degree is 40 credits.          How many students are in the graduate Food Studies program?   At any given time, approximately 160 students (full or part-time) are enrolled in the Food Studies program. An average of 60 students matriculate each year.          Does the Department offer any study abroad opportunities?   NYU operates a number of campuses and maintains relationships with other universities around the world, thus providing students with a variety of study abroad opportunities. Many departments offer courses in these locations throughout the year. The Study Abroad office has more information about these options ( steinhardt.nyu.edu/study_abroad ). The Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health regularly offers courses abroad.    The Food Studies Department offers courses in Pueblo, Mexico, Hong Kong, Paris, Florence and in depth course sites in the United States.          Is it possible to visit classes?   Unfortunately, the University does not allow prospective students to sit in on a class.          How do I get an ID card?   Student IDs are available at the NYU Card Center (383 Lafayette St.), Tel: 212-443-2273. For more information, visit http://www.nyu.edu/nyucard/about/how.obtain.nyucard.html          How do I apply for scholarships?   School-based scholarship consideration is available to full-time and part-time applicants who submt a FAFSA by February 1 for the Fall Semester and October 1 for the Spring Semester. Learn more about the process and the financial aid available at NYU Steinhardt at http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/financial_aid .    Many outside organizations offer scholarships for graduate students. Listings for some of these can be found on our Resources page, but we encourage students to search elsewhere for funding opportunities, as many available options are not posted. Be certain to check the organization's website for application deadlines.          How do I find out about financial aid?   To be considered for any type of financial aid (including scholarships and student loans), applicants must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as FAFSA (www.fafsa.ed.gov). In order to qualify for full-time financial aid, you must be taking at least 12 credits. Part-time students must take a minimun of 6 credits. Learn more about the process and the financial aid available at NYU Steinhardt at http:// steinhardt.nyu.edu/financial_aid .           How long does it take to hear from graduate admissions?   The admission process is coordinated through the Office of Graduate Admission. Applicants generally hear from graduate admissions withint six to eight weeks of having a completed application. During the review months following application deadlines, the process may take longer. Please be advised that there is no way for the Department to track the status of an application.          Should I go part-time or full-time?   We highly recommend that students attend part-time. By pursuing related jobs and internship opportunities while in school, we believe that students get more out of the program and have stronger job prospects upon completion. However, in certain circumstances, a full-time commitment makes more sense for some students. We suggest discussing the options with a Food Studies advisor. For financial aid purposes, part-time means 6 credits and full-time means 12 or more credits per semester.          How do I find out about what classes are offered?   For up-to-date information, see the NYU course schedule ( www.nyu.edu/registrar/listings ) and individual departments&rsquo; course schedules, which are usually linked through department websites.    For the schedule and descriptions of courses offered through the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, please visit steinhardt.nyu.edu/nutrition/courses .          What are the core classes? What are the concentration requirements?   All students are required to take five core classes and two research classes. They must also take four additional classes within their area of concentration &ndash; Food Systems or Food Culture. Substitutions may be permitted after consultation with a Food Studies advisor. For additional information about requirements, see the curriculum summary .          May I enroll in courses outside the Department, Steinhardt and beyond NYU?   Students may enroll in most classes offered through Steinhardt without special permission. For classes in other schools at NYU, students need to get advanced approval from a Food Sudies advisor within our department and permission from the professor of the course and his/her home department. Courses in other universities require both advanced permission from a Department advisor and permission from the other institution. In addition, an official transcript must be sent to the Department upon completion of the course.          What if I went to culinary school? Do I take fewer classes? Am I exempt from any classes?   No.          I've taken graduate courses at another University, do those credits transfer over?   If you have taken graduate level classes, that did not serve towards another degree, at another university within the past 10 years and received a B or higher, you may receive advanced standing when you matriculate. The courses must be approved by a Food Studies advisor.          What prerequisite courses are there?   There are no prerequisites.          Do I need a culinary degree?   While we do not require that students hold a culinary degree, we certainly value the accomplishment.          Are GREs required?   As of now, we do not require that students take the GREs. If you have already taken the exam and earned a high score, please feel free to include it in your application.          Can I receive credit for participating in an internship?   We urge students to pursue internships while in the program. However, there is no graduate internship course through which students receive credit. On rare occasions, if the organization demands that a student receive credit, then pending advisor approval, he/she may register and pay for a one-credit independent study.          Where can I find the syllabi set for the core classes?   Syllabi change yearly to reflect the most recent developments and literature in the field. Samples of syllabi from recent years are available for your reference:       FOOD-GE 2191 Food and Culture    FOOD-GE 2017 Contemporary Issues in Food Studies    FOOD-GE 2012 Food History    FOOD-GE 2033 Food Systems    FOOD-GE 2034 Food Systems: Advanced Topics                                          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

Next Video &gt;&gt;         Global Programs          Who we are    Food Studies at NYU is one of the first master&rsquo;s degree programs in the U.S. devoted to food scholarship. Employing approaches from the humanities and social sciences, the program prepares students to analyze the current American food system, its global connections, and local alternatives. The program examines cultural, political, economic, environmental, and geographic approaches to food within local, urban and global contexts.    The MA in Food Studies requires 19 credits in mandatory coursework that covers food systems, culture, and policy, as well as a research component. Beyond these requirements, students can take 21 credits in specialization modules (policy/advocacy, business/social entrepreneurship, media/cultural analysis) to dig deeper into their interests. Our mission is to examine the ways in which individuals, communities, and societies produce, distribute, and consume food. Cities at the center of flows of people, produce, and media products, are the prime locus of our investigations.    Why NYU Food Studies?       Learn from the best. Our faculty , prominent leaders in their field, teach and mentor students, while actively conducting research to stay engaged.    Get insider access. Upon enrolling, students study with food professionals who serve as adjuncts and guest lecturers and are welcomed by food production companies, non-profit food organizations, publishers, public relations and marketing firms, magazines, food distributors, food producers and educational institutions.    Study abroad. We now offer coursework --and a program of study--in global sites like Paris, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Puebla, for students to gain an immersive experience in an international context.    Be challenged . Students learn experientially, taking core and specialization courses, as well as interdisciplinary electives within Steinhardt, Stern School of Business, Wagner School of Public Service, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or Tisch School of the Arts.    Get ahead. We help students find internships in an array of potential employment sites and place them in positions where they can develop new skills and collaborate with potential employers.    Gain practical skills . The program places an emphasis on the development of critical thinking and research which prepares students for situations they will encounter in the profession.       What you'll learn    Upon completion of our program, students will be able to:       Apply an interdisciplinary approach to understand the cultural, political, and economic aspects of the food system.    Demonstrate their knowledge to discuss with fluency issues related to food sovereignty, sustainability, ethics and culture.    Assess policies that shape the food landscape, addressing questions of equity and preserving cultural values.    Launch and develop careers in policy; advocacy; media, social, and cultural analysis; academia; business and social entrepreneurship; and research.

Next Video &gt;&gt;         Global Programs          Who we are    Food Studies at NYU is one of the first master&rsquo;s degree programs in the U.S. devoted to food scholarship. Employing approaches from the humanities and social sciences, the program prepares students to analyze the current American food system, its global connections, and local alternatives. The program examines cultural, political, economic, environmental, and geographic approaches to food within local, urban and global contexts.    The MA in Food Studies requires 19 credits in mandatory coursework that covers food systems, culture, and policy, as well as a research component. Beyond these requirements, students can take 21 credits in specialization modules (policy/advocacy, business/social entrepreneurship, media/cultural analysis) to dig deeper into their interests. Our mission is to examine the ways in which individuals, communities, and societies produce, distribute, and consume food. Cities at the center of flows of people, produce, and media products, are the prime locus of our investigations.    Why NYU Food Studies?       Learn from the best. Our faculty , prominent leaders in their field, teach and mentor students, while actively conducting research to stay engaged.    Get insider access. Upon enrolling, students study with food professionals who serve as adjuncts and guest lecturers and are welcomed by food production companies, non-profit food organizations, publishers, public relations and marketing firms, magazines, food distributors, food producers and educational institutions.    Study abroad. We now offer coursework --and a program of study--in global sites like Paris, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Puebla, for students to gain an immersive experience in an international context.    Be challenged . Students learn experientially, taking core and specialization courses, as well as interdisciplinary electives within Steinhardt, Stern School of Business, Wagner School of Public Service, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or Tisch School of the Arts.    Get ahead. We help students find internships in an array of potential employment sites and place them in positions where they can develop new skills and collaborate with potential employers.    Gain practical skills . The program places an emphasis on the development of critical thinking and research which prepares students for situations they will encounter in the profession.       What you'll learn    Upon completion of our program, students will be able to:       Apply an interdisciplinary approach to understand the cultural, political, and economic aspects of the food system.    Demonstrate their knowledge to discuss with fluency issues related to food sovereignty, sustainability, ethics and culture.    Assess policies that shape the food landscape, addressing questions of equity and preserving cultural values.    Launch and develop careers in policy; advocacy; media, social, and cultural analysis; academia; business and social entrepreneurship; and research.

Next Video &gt;&gt;         Global Programs          Who we are    Food Studies at NYU is one of the first master&rsquo;s degree programs in the U.S. devoted to food scholarship. Employing approaches from the humanities and social sciences, the program prepares students to analyze the current American food system, its global connections, and local alternatives. The program examines cultural, political, economic, environmental, and geographic approaches to food within local, urban and global contexts.    The MA in Food Studies requires 19 credits in mandatory coursework that covers food systems, culture, and policy, as well as a research component. Beyond these requirements, students can take 21 credits in specialization modules (policy/advocacy, business/social entrepreneurship, media/cultural analysis) to dig deeper into their interests. Our mission is to examine the ways in which individuals, communities, and societies produce, distribute, and consume food. Cities at the center of flows of people, produce, and media products, are the prime locus of our investigations.    Why NYU Food Studies?       Learn from the best. Our faculty , prominent leaders in their field, teach and mentor students, while actively conducting research to stay engaged.    Get insider access. Upon enrolling, students study with food professionals who serve as adjuncts and guest lecturers and are welcomed by food production companies, non-profit food organizations, publishers, public relations and marketing firms, magazines, food distributors, food producers and educational institutions.    Study abroad. We now offer coursework --and a program of study--in global sites like Paris, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Puebla, for students to gain an immersive experience in an international context.    Be challenged . Students learn experientially, taking core and specialization courses, as well as interdisciplinary electives within Steinhardt, Stern School of Business, Wagner School of Public Service, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or Tisch School of the Arts.    Get ahead. We help students find internships in an array of potential employment sites and place them in positions where they can develop new skills and collaborate with potential employers.    Gain practical skills . The program places an emphasis on the development of critical thinking and research which prepares students for situations they will encounter in the profession.       What you'll learn    Upon completion of our program, students will be able to:       Apply an interdisciplinary approach to understand the cultural, political, and economic aspects of the food system.    Demonstrate their knowledge to discuss with fluency issues related to food sovereignty, sustainability, ethics and culture.    Assess policies that shape the food landscape, addressing questions of equity and preserving cultural values.    Launch and develop careers in policy; advocacy; media, social, and cultural analysis; academia; business and social entrepreneurship; and research.

Most students take advantage of New York&rsquo;s vast public transportation   system while studying at NYU. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority&rsquo;s   (MTA) website has information about available subways, buses, and trains, including   maps and relevant schedules ( www.mta.info ). NYU also provides shuttle   and trolley services between all dorms and major education centers throughout   the city. For more information about these services, visit the campus transportation   section of NYU&rsquo;s Office of Public Transportation ( www.nyu.edu/public.safety/transportation ).             What are the housing options available for students?   While on-campus graduate student housing is available, it remains very limited.   The Off Campus Housing Office assists students in finding accommodations outside   of the University ( www.nyu.edu/housing/offcampus ).   A variety of other lists are also available to students in need of housing   in New York, including the Village Voice ( www.villagevoice.com ),   Craigslists ( newyork.craigslist.org ), and The New York Times ( nytimes.com/pages/realestate ).   For more information about housing options, visit NYU&rsquo;s Department of   Housing ( www.nyu.edu/housing ).             Do I need health insurance? Where can I get it?   All graduate students are required to have health insurance. NYU offers a range   of health insurance plans, depending on students&rsquo; needs and credit load.   If you have health insurance from another company or organization outside of   NYU, you may opt out of the university plan. For more information, visit the   Student Health Center&rsquo;s health insurance webpage ( www.nyu.edu/shc/about/insurance.html ).          How much does the program cost?   Costs for the program are on a per-credit basis, plus basic registration fees.   In general, cost per credit is reduced slightly as credit load increases. For   current cost structures, visit www.nyu.edu/bursar/tuition.fees/ .   Additional information is available at NYU&rsquo;s Office of the Bursar ( www.nyu.edu/bursar ).          How long does it take a typical student to complete the master's program?   Most graduate Food Studies students attend part-time and take between 2 and 3 years to complete the degree. Full-time students can complete the program faster, but we do not recommend this. Students get more out of the program and receive stronger job opportunities by enrolling only part-time and working/interning while studying.          How many students are in the classes?   We limit most classes to 25 students; however seminar, writing, and research classes are often smaller.          What is the average age of the students?   Students range in age from recent college graduates to retirees. Most students are in their late twenties.          Does the Food Studies graduate program require an internship? When should I do it?   We strongly urge all Food Studies students to pursue as many internships as possible during their graduate career. We maintain an email list serve for all currently enrolled graduate students, where we continually post notices regarding internship and job opportunities. We recommend that students pursue different positions each semester.          What if I'm interested in both food and nutrition (or public health)? Is there a joint degree?   No joint graduate degrees are allowed at NYU. However, students have many opportunities to take nutrition and public health courses within the Department. Students can also take classes across Steinhardt and, with permission from advisor and professor, from academic departments in other schools at NYU.          What are the two specialization tracks?   In brief, the two specializations are: FOOD CULTURE, which examines the social, economic, cultural, and psychological factors that have influenced food consumption practices and patterns in the past and present. Students research historical, sociological and anthropological aspects of food. FOOD SYSTEMS, which explores the food systems, tracing commodities and agricultural concerns from production through consumption. Emphasizing international, national and local food systems, students explore environmental, ethical, and economic factors in food production and distribution.          Is there a strict curriculum, or do I choose my own classes?   The Food Studies curriculum is broken down into three categories &ndash; core requirements, concentration requirements, and electives. For additional information about requirements, see section below on core classes.          What kind of job can I get when I graduate?   Food Studies graduates find jobs in all areas within the food industry.    FOOD CULTURE    Food Culture graduates find jobs within 5 broad categories:       Publishing (magazines, newspapers, online sources)     Public relations (restaurants, food lobby groups, cookbooks, food    &bull; organizations)    Marketing (for restaurants, celebrity chefs, cookbooks, organizations)    Nonprofit work (education, food/hunger advocacy groups)     Food operations (wine importers/distributors, restaurants, retail)       FOOD SYSTEMS    For graduates of Food Systems, common job categories include:       Local   and national governmental (city government, federal government, food regulations,   relations between industry and government)    NGO work in advocacy and policy (farming, labor, food scarcity,   trade)    Development organizations (community building, national programs, international   trade and aid organizations)    Food production companies (producers and manufacturers of food   items)    Food distribution companies (importation, transportation, and retail)             How do I register? When do I register?   Each semester, you need to make an appointment with a graduate advisor. These appointments may be in person or over the phone. Prior to the appointment, you should pre-select classes and make a list of pertinent questions. Students in their first semester meet three times as a group in New Student Seminar. We devote one of these sessions to advising.          What percentage of applicants receive acceptance into Food Studies?   All applicants will be considered for admission. Successful candidates typically have a strong undergraduate GPA, an up-to-date resume, and a well-crafted essay with goals and motivations that are in line with those of the program and department. Relevant experience in the food profession, while not required is helpful and strongly encouraged.          Are there informational sessions offered?   We offer 2-hour information sessions every month. You can sign up for one on our website.          How many credits do I need to graduate?   The Food Studies degree is 40 credits.          How many students are in the graduate Food Studies program?   At any given time, approximately 160 students (full or part-time) are enrolled in the Food Studies program. An average of 60 students matriculate each year.          Does the Department offer any study abroad opportunities?   NYU operates a number of campuses and maintains relationships with other universities around the world, thus providing students with a variety of study abroad opportunities. Many departments offer courses in these locations throughout the year. The Study Abroad office has more information about these options ( steinhardt.nyu.edu/study_abroad ). The Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health regularly offers courses abroad.    The Food Studies Department offers courses in Pueblo, Mexico, Hong Kong, Paris, Florence and in depth course sites in the United States.          Is it possible to visit classes?   Unfortunately, the University does not allow prospective students to sit in on a class.          How do I get an ID card?   Student IDs are available at the NYU Card Center (383 Lafayette St.), Tel: 212-443-2273. For more information, visit http://www.nyu.edu/nyucard/about/how.obtain.nyucard.html          How do I apply for scholarships?   School-based scholarship consideration is available to full-time and part-time applicants who submt a FAFSA by February 1 for the Fall Semester and October 1 for the Spring Semester. Learn more about the process and the financial aid available at NYU Steinhardt at http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/financial_aid .    Many outside organizations offer scholarships for graduate students. Listings for some of these can be found on our Resources page, but we encourage students to search elsewhere for funding opportunities, as many available options are not posted. Be certain to check the organization's website for application deadlines.          How do I find out about financial aid?   To be considered for any type of financial aid (including scholarships and student loans), applicants must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as FAFSA (www.fafsa.ed.gov). In order to qualify for full-time financial aid, you must be taking at least 12 credits. Part-time students must take a minimun of 6 credits. Learn more about the process and the financial aid available at NYU Steinhardt at http:// steinhardt.nyu.edu/financial_aid .           How long does it take to hear from graduate admissions?   The admission process is coordinated through the Office of Graduate Admission. Applicants generally hear from graduate admissions withint six to eight weeks of having a completed application. During the review months following application deadlines, the process may take longer. Please be advised that there is no way for the Department to track the status of an application.          Should I go part-time or full-time?   We highly recommend that students attend part-time. By pursuing related jobs and internship opportunities while in school, we believe that students get more out of the program and have stronger job prospects upon completion. However, in certain circumstances, a full-time commitment makes more sense for some students. We suggest discussing the options with a Food Studies advisor. For financial aid purposes, part-time means 6 credits and full-time means 12 or more credits per semester.          How do I find out about what classes are offered?   For up-to-date information, see the NYU course schedule ( www.nyu.edu/registrar/listings ) and individual departments&rsquo; course schedules, which are usually linked through department websites.    For the schedule and descriptions of courses offered through the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, please visit steinhardt.nyu.edu/nutrition/courses .          What are the core classes? What are the concentration requirements?   All students are required to take five core classes and two research classes. They must also take four additional classes within their area of concentration &ndash; Food Systems or Food Culture. Substitutions may be permitted after consultation with a Food Studies advisor. For additional information about requirements, see the curriculum summary .          May I enroll in courses outside the Department, Steinhardt and beyond NYU?   Students may enroll in most classes offered through Steinhardt without special permission. For classes in other schools at NYU, students need to get advanced approval from a Food Sudies advisor within our department and permission from the professor of the course and his/her home department. Courses in other universities require both advanced permission from a Department advisor and permission from the other institution. In addition, an official transcript must be sent to the Department upon completion of the course.          What if I went to culinary school? Do I take fewer classes? Am I exempt from any classes?   No.          I've taken graduate courses at another University, do those credits transfer over?   If you have taken graduate level classes, that did not serve towards another degree, at another university within the past 10 years and received a B or higher, you may receive advanced standing when you matriculate. The courses must be approved by a Food Studies advisor.          What prerequisite courses are there?   There are no prerequisites.          Do I need a culinary degree?   While we do not require that students hold a culinary degree, we certainly value the accomplishment.          Are GREs required?   As of now, we do not require that students take the GREs. If you have already taken the exam and earned a high score, please feel free to include it in your application.          Can I receive credit for participating in an internship?   We urge students to pursue internships while in the program. However, there is no graduate internship course through which students receive credit. On rare occasions, if the organization demands that a student receive credit, then pending advisor approval, he/she may register and pay for a one-credit independent study.          Where can I find the syllabi set for the core classes?   Syllabi change yearly to reflect the most recent developments and literature in the field. Samples of syllabi from recent years are available for your reference:       FOOD-GE 2191 Food and Culture    FOOD-GE 2017 Contemporary Issues in Food Studies    FOOD-GE 2012 Food History    FOOD-GE 2033 Food Systems    FOOD-GE 2034 Food Systems: Advanced Topics                                          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
