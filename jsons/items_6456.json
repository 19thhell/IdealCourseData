Mission Statement: Narrative Medicine fortifies clinical practice with the narrative competence to recognize, absorb, metabolize, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness. Through narrative training, the Program in Narrative Medicine helps doctors, nurses, social workers, and therapists to improve the effectiveness of care by developing the capacity for attention, reflection, representation, and affiliation with patients and colleagues. Our research and outreach missions are conceptualizing, evaluating, and spear-heading these ideas and practices nationally and internationally. &#160;                                                Facebook   Twitter   YouTube   Instagram   Visitor Information   Directories   Offices and Departments   Site Map   NYU School of Law                   Prospective Info   Admissions (JD) Admissions (LLM/JSD) Areas of Study Degrees Offered Faculty Profiles Campus Map  Academics   Academic Sitemap Course Descriptions Class Schedules NYU Classes Clinics Academic Calendars  Departments   Academic Services Career Services Financial Aid Graduate Affairs (LLM) Hospitality and Events Housing Human Resources Library Operations and Facilities Records and Registration Student Affairs  Tools and Resources   About the Law School Campus Map Directories Law School News Journals Picture Book                      \u00a9 2015 New York University School of Law. 40 Washington Sq.
