His first book, Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire and Modern British Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), explores the emergence of modern war culture in the first half of the 20th century. He argues that the British state and war machine actively cannibalized culture as it reinvented itself in times of crisis and focus, and him on the struggle of writers and intellectuals to find their own perspectives on total war. His next book, Deep England: Forging British Culture After Empire , focuses on the second half of the twentieth century and explores tropes of violence, consumption, secrecy, dissent and nostalgia in a national literature and culture that he argues has actively resisted decline and decolonization between 1945 and the present. He is also currently working on a book project on contemporary US and British war culture, whose working title is Surge and Silence: Understanding America\u2019s Cultures of War . I have published essays on film adaptation, Anti-Americanism, W.H. Auden\u2019s poetry, and transatlantic modernism, and have guest edited special issues of Social Text on The Ends of War (ST 91, Summer 2007) and Punk and Its Afterlives (ST 113, forthcoming Summer 2013). Recent graduate courses have included \u201cImperial Modernism,\u201d \u201cWar Culture,\u201d and \u201cLate Modernism.\u201d His teaching focuses on war culture and war literature, modernism, twentieth century British literature and culture, and the novel and film.       He is Guest Editor of The Ends of War , a Special Issue of Social Text 91 (Summer 2007) vol. 25.2., and Co-Editor, with Gyan Prakash and Ella Shohat, of Reflections on the Work of Edward Said: Special Issue, Social Text 87:, (Summer 2006) vol. 24.2.

Bio &amp; Publications           About the Course   This course is a survey of American literature and literary history, from the early colonial period to the eve of the Civil War. Our goal will be to acquire a grasp of the canon of American literature as it is typically conceived and the various logics behind its construction.          Key Topics   Topics to be considered include: the rise of \u201cliterature\u201d as a discipline unto itself; the meaning of American individualism; the conflict between liberty and equality in American social thought; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the relation between history and cultural mythology; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; the American obsession with race; the ideology of domesticity and its link to the sentimental; the aesthetics of American romance; the role of biography in literary criticism and historiography; the nature of the \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d; what it means to say \u201cNO in thunder!\u201d and why so many American writers seem to say it; deliberative democracy and cosmopolitanism.

His first book, Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire and Modern British Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), explores the emergence of modern war culture in the first half of the 20th century. He argues that the British state and war machine actively cannibalized culture as it reinvented itself in times of crisis and focus, and him on the struggle of writers and intellectuals to find their own perspectives on total war. His next book, Deep England: Forging British Culture After Empire , focuses on the second half of the twentieth century and explores tropes of violence, consumption, secrecy, dissent and nostalgia in a national literature and culture that he argues has actively resisted decline and decolonization between 1945 and the present. He is also currently working on a book project on contemporary US and British war culture, whose working title is Surge and Silence: Understanding America\u2019s Cultures of War . I have published essays on film adaptation, Anti-Americanism, W.H. Auden\u2019s poetry, and transatlantic modernism, and have guest edited special issues of Social Text on The Ends of War (ST 91, Summer 2007) and Punk and Its Afterlives (ST 113, forthcoming Summer 2013). Recent graduate courses have included \u201cImperial Modernism,\u201d \u201cWar Culture,\u201d and \u201cLate Modernism.\u201d His teaching focuses on war culture and war literature, modernism, twentieth century British literature and culture, and the novel and film.
