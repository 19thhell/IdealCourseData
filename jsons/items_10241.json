These seminars may also include talks or   masterclasses by guests actively involved in the creation or performance   of music.   Special Studies: The Sabbateni collection of manuscripts and editions in Fales, and its music - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 001) Thursday 2:00-4:00 Instructor: Stanley Boorman This course provides the opportunity to work with original sources, manuscripts and editions. The large Sabbateni collection comes from the end of the 16th century, and certainly from Prague. The course will study the sources as documents, the music they contain (by some of the major composers of the time, as well as previously unknown music), performance issues, and the impact of the cultural background of Prague as Imperial capital and hotbed of religious dispute. The course will require continuous work with the original materials, in the Fales collections in Bobst Library.   Special Studies: Luigi Nono - critical thought, compositional pathways, and sonic travels inward - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 002) Monday 2:00-4:00 Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman When Luigi Nono encountered a particular medieval inscription on a Spanish monastery toward the end of his life, the phrase spoke to him directly: \"...there are no paths, only traveling itself.\" This course is an in-depth study of Nono's political, social, and musical thought; and a detailed exploration of his compositional practice over the course of his life. The ultimate goal of the course is to consider, with the benefit of the most recent scholarship on Nono and on/by selected colleagues and students, of the relationship of these two realms, i.e., the socio-political and the sonic. We will spend more extended time exploring individual works of music, some of which border on theater of a unique sort, and all of which are highly concerned with prompting heightened consciousness through listening ideals.  Special Studies: Genre and Popular Music - Aesthetics, Economics, Identities - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 001) Tuesday 2:00-4:00 Instructor: Maureen Mahon Genre, a way of categorizing creative work, plays a significant role in the ways popular music is produced, promoted, circulated, and consumed. In this course, we will discuss popular musical genres, primarily in the 20th &amp; 21st century United States, and consider the following questions: How have music scholars historicized, analyzed, and critiqued the formation of music genres? How do aesthetic considerations, economic interests, and social forces shape the ways musicians, audiences, and music industry professionals define and assign musical sounds and practices to genres? What is the impact of these categories on music making, music marketing, and identity construction? How do musical and \"extra-musical\" factors contribute to the definition of genre? How and why do music genres change? How and why do music genres matter?   Special Studies: Globalization of Irish Music, Dance, Literature and Theatre Performance - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 002) Monday 6:10-8:40 Instructor: Mick Moloney This seminar is an introduction to the complex processes of cultural globalization. The area of exploration is the cultural landscape of Ireland and Irish America, in particular Irish music, dance, literature and theatre. The seminar leaders Jean Butler and Mick Moloney bring a wide range of experience as performers and teachers to the subject matter. The course will explore the interrelated and codependent dynamics of the local and the global, addressing processes that alter the perception of how culture is constructed, received, transmitted and transformed throughout time and space. As Ireland approaches the centenary of the Easter Uprising of 1916, this course will identify cultural landmarks that illustrate the effect of globalization has on the Irish psyche at home and abroad. The multiple identities of Ireland and its diaspora worldwide are and have been in constant flux through the global re-imaginings of works such as Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock , Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa , the Irish-Step Dance spectacular Riverdance , Michael Keegan Dolan's The Bull, Colin Dunne's Out of Time , John McColgan's Heartbeat of Home , and Martin McDonagh's Cripple of Inishmaan , and various seminal Irish influences on the formation of what are now considered to be central forms of American culture over the past three centuries.
