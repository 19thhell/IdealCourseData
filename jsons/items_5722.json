Taking advantage of Stern\u2019s location at the center of global business, the Office of Student Engagement connects you with opportunities to tackle real business challenges and to transform ideas into action that makes an impact on a broad scale. Programs include:     Stern Consulting Corps (SCC) - Since its inception in 2002, the Stern Consulting Corps (SCC) has partnered thousands of students with prominent non-profit and for-profit organizations to help make a lasting business-driven impact. SCC students learn how to solve complex business problems, from problem definition to final client presentation, while simultaneously working on their live consulting project. This hands-on experiential learning opportunity allows students to work in teams to tackle a critical business issue or opportunity while applying the skills, tools and frameworks they are learning in the classroom.       A Stern Consulting Corps engagement with City Harvest was featured in a New York Post article     SCC's partnership with Jersey City's Economic Development Corporation to revise its strategy and expand its impact was featured in the Financial Times          Stern Signature Projects - Stern Signature Projects provide specifically tailored opportunities for students to extend their MBA education beyond the classroom by deepening their understanding and engagement with a specific subject, idea and/or industry. Past Stern Signature Project teams have partnered with leading NYU faculty on cutting-edge research to help solve real world problems and supported entrepreneurs domestically and in developing countries across a range of industries. Stern Signature Projects offer a tremendous opportunity for students to take even greater personal ownership of their educational and professional development at Stern.       Read more about the recent Stern Signature Project focusing on urbanization and policy change in Mexico City          Board Fellows Program - Select second-year MBA students serve on the boards of NYC-based nonprofit organizations for nine-month fellowships. Fellows act as non-voting members, work on committees and complete a strategic project for the board. Board Fellows partners have included the Alzheimer's Association of New York, The Fresh Air Fund and Grow NYC.       Social Impact Internship Fund (SIIF) - A highly competitive fellowship, SIIF supports select first-year MBA students pursuing summer internships with nonprofit organizations and for-profit social enterprises.

Students have an extraordinary array of formal and informal hands-on learning opportunities that help to connect theory to practice. The broad spectrum of experiential learning opportunities available to students at NYU ranges from internships to service learning, and includes both public service and community-based activities.   While each school offers its students somewhat different opportunities, all view the chance for engagement in the life of New York City and, in specific, professional areas of interest as powerful ways to enrich students' education. Experiential learning opportunities expose students to new ways of understanding, engage them in relevant activities, and help them make connections between their coursework and their workplace. Collectively, these experiences help to enhance the student experience and make NYU students, and thus the University, a major resource to New York City.   Internships     Internships are course, program, and/or career related activities that fall on a continuum from participant-observation activities, such as apprenticing on a film-shoot, to fully engaged activities, such as contributing copy to a journal. When credit-bearing, internships are generally department or course-based, and directly related to the field for which the student is preparing. Such internships, which are unpaid, tend to draw on knowledge and skills developed through coursework.   Other internships are paid and are often associated with the Wasserman Center for Career Development . Such internships may be related to coursework and are almost always linked to students' career aspirations. This type of internship is attractive to many students, both for financial reasons and as a means of professional development. Register today for CareerNet at the Wasserman Center to gain instant access to a variety of amazing opportunities and resources, including the iNet Internship Network .     Students interested in civic engagement can find additional internship and grant opportunities through the Office of Civic Engagement . These opportunities include America Reads/America Counts , NYU Jumpstart , and NYU's Public Service Corp . The NYU Civic Team also provides students with volunteer and internship opportunities at New York City not-for-profit and government agencies.     Service Learning     Service learning typically deepens the linkage between academic and experiential learning. This linkage can be accomplished in several ways. Public service learning often involves course-based internships, as well as field experiences with pay. Community-based learning can also involve course-based internships, but noncredit service-learning initiatives can be developed as well. Explore these service learning options with your academic advisor to make sure you are aware of all that is possible.
