Pricing      MKTG-UB 53 (3 units)     Prerequisites: MKTG-UB 1              This course provides students with the frameworks, techniques, and latest thinking on assessing and formulating pricing strategies.

Data Driven Decision Making      MKTG-UB 54 (3 units)     Prerequisites: MKTG-UB 1              With recent technological advances and developments in customer databases, firms have access to vast amounts of high-quality data which allows them to understand customer behavior and customize business tactics to increasingly fine segments. Much of the promise of such data-driven policies, however, has failed to materialize because managers find it difficult to translate customer data into actionable policies. This course aims to fill this gap by providing students with the tools and techniques used in making business decisions. The emphasis of the class is on applications and interpretation of the results for use in making real-life business decisions.

The unifying framework for these activities is the annual marketing plan. Thus, the course simulates the product/brand/marketing manager\u2019s job through the development and implementation of a marketing plan for a particular good or service.              Digital Business Strategies      MKTG-UB 56 (2 units)              This course covers the digital technology industry (e.g. consumer electronics, software) from a strategic and marketing perspective.

Video Game Business      MKTG-UB 58 (2 units)              Video games are now a mainstream form of entertainment. In economic terms, this industry has experienced tremendous growth, despite a grueling recession, growing to an estimated $60 billion worldwide. A key development that has changed the playing field for both the producers and consumers of interactive entertainment is a shift away from physical retail to digital and online game distribution. The audience for games has also shifted\u2014no longer the exclusive practice of hardcore gamers, video games have gained mass appeal in the form of social and casual gaming, on the internet, on consoles, and smartphones. At the same time, the development and publishing of games has become far more accessible. The game behind the game, in a manner of speaking, has changed.

Innovation is risky, however, and most new products fail in the marketplace. Thus, expertise in the design and marketing of new products is a critical skill for all managers, inside and outside the marketing department. This course focuses on the tools and techniques associated with analyzing market opportunities as well as on designing, testing, and introducing new products and services. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are covered.

Much of the promise of such data-driven policies, however, has failed to materialize because managers find it difficult to translate customer data into actionable policies. This course aims to fill this gap by providing students with the tools and techniques used in making business decisions. The emphasis of the class is on applications and interpretation of the results for use in making real-life business decisions.

Video Game Business      MKTG-UB 58 (2 units)              Video games are now a mainstream form of entertainment. In economic terms, this industry has experienced tremendous growth, despite a grueling recession, growing to an estimated $60 billion worldwide. A key development that has changed the playing field for both the producers and consumers of interactive entertainment is a shift away from physical retail to digital and online game distribution. The audience for games has also shifted\u2014no longer the exclusive practice of hardcore gamers, video games have gained mass appeal in the form of social and casual gaming, on the internet, on consoles, and smartphones. At the same time, the development and publishing of games has become far more accessible. The game behind the game, in a manner of speaking, has changed.
