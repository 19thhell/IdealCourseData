This course will survey some of the most dynamic debates on music\u2019s past, present, and future waged in impassioned arguments between music theorists, critics, artists, and audiences as preserved in historical literature. Our focus is on the seemingly inevitable tension between what music is, what it should be and what it can be. Starting with the Greek philosophers of antiquity, we will study debates on the music of figures like Claudio Monteverdi, Ludwig van Beethoven, Richard Wagner, James Reese Europe, Duke Ellington, and Bob Dylan, and explore the backlash against and defense of styles like jazz, rock and roll, punk rock, and rap. The goal of this course is to better understand how culture is \u201cmade\u201d during moments of charged debate, where a particular music\u2019s perceived transgressions or merits serve as the pretext for larger conflicting ideological issues. Art, in this sense, becomes a site where competing aesthetic values reveal and articulate deep social and cultural rifts. This class will meet twice a week; our first session is devoted to scrutinizing and discussing primary sources, i.e. letters, newspaper and magazine articles, journal entries, audio recordings, film, and even commentary from the internet (e.g. Youtube). For our second session we will read secondary (scholarly) sources for context and use this as a way to think critically about our own aesthetic judgments. Debates on tradition and innovation in music, as we shall see, are a long-standing tradition in its own right.

This course will survey some of the most dynamic debates on music\u2019s past, present, and future waged in impassioned arguments between music theorists, critics, artists, and audiences as preserved in historical literature. Our focus is on the seemingly inevitable tension between what music is, what it should be and what it can be. Starting with the Greek philosophers of antiquity, we will study debates on the music of figures like Claudio Monteverdi, Ludwig van Beethoven, Richard Wagner, James Reese Europe, Duke Ellington, and Bob Dylan, and explore the backlash against and defense of styles like jazz, rock and roll, punk rock, and rap. The goal of this course is to better understand how culture is \u201cmade\u201d during moments of charged debate, where a particular music\u2019s perceived transgressions or merits serve as the pretext for larger conflicting ideological issues. Art, in this sense, becomes a site where competing aesthetic values reveal and articulate deep social and cultural rifts. This class will meet twice a week; our first session is devoted to scrutinizing and discussing primary sources, i.e. letters, newspaper and magazine articles, journal entries, audio recordings, film, and even commentary from the internet (e.g. Youtube). For our second session we will read secondary (scholarly) sources for context and use this as a way to think critically about our own aesthetic judgments. Debates on tradition and innovation in music, as we shall see, are a long-standing tradition in its own right.
