This addiction has driven a vast intergalactic society to commit the biggest copyright violation since the Big Bang. The resulting fines and penalties have bankrupted the whole universe. We humans suddenly own everything-and the aliens are not amused. Nick Carter, a lawyer who knows a thing or two about copyright law, may be the only thing standing between us and total destruction.   book talk information     The Relationship between the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court in the Development of Patent Law   March 13, 2013  Abstract: An informal discussion between Judges Timothy Dyk and Pauline Newman. The interchange should be lively: both are judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with very different ideas about intellectual property policy and theories of adjudication.   Defensive Patent License Project   February 1, 2013  Abstract: The Defensive Patent License (DPL) is a new legal mechanism to protect innovators by networking patents into powerful, mutually-beneficial legal shields that are 100% committed to defending innovation \u2013 no bullies, trolls, or other leeches allowed. It is designed to address the most broken parts of the patent system. The DPL also helps prevent adversaries from patenting open technologies and pulling them out of the public domain. It is an open source-style patent license that seeks to promote the use of patents to encourage freedom to innovate &amp; to operate instead of using them to shut down competition, for rent-seeking, or to inhibit access to knowledge. This approach offers several potential benefits, especially to open innovation communities and/or start-ups: 1) A way to legally bind companies/patents to exclusive defensive use; 2) A way to allow those who are skeptical/critical of the patent system to participate without worry that their innovations will be offensively weaponized; 3) A way to improve prior art by filing defense-oriented patent applications that will preempt future offensive applications; 4) A way to prevent patent trolls from exploiting patents by preemptively committing them to defensive-only use; and 5) A way to provide access to a clear collection of patents that anyone can use for free as long as they are also committed to defensive uses.   Tri-State Region IP Workshop [Third Annual]   January 11, 2013  Abstract: Professors, fellows, visitors, graduate students, and practitioners from the tri-state region presented their works in progress for commentary in a workshop environment. Topics were related to intellectual property or information law. The format involved a series of plenary sessions chaired by a senior commentator. This annual workshop will make it possible for IP and information law scholars located in the tri-state region to get together on a more regular basis to share and discuss each other\u2019s work.   Life as a New IP Associate    October 4, 2012  Abstract: A panel discussion on how to transition from law school to private practice.   Convening Cultural Commons   September 23-24, 2011  Abstract: The purpose of this workshop is to gather scholars from a variety of disciplines who share interests in the study of commons as governance regimes in information, knowledge, and other cultural contexts. The focus will be on institutional analysis of commons, common pool resources, and related institutions for governance of knowledge and information and rights in knowledge and information. Relevant disciplines include law, political science, economics, sociology, organizational science, information science, Science and Technology Studies (STS), and the history of science and technology, among others.   workshop information   Ostrom lecture information   Cultural Protocols Workshop   August 19, 2011  Abstract: This workshop will bring together a small group of legal and cultural scholars to explore the concept and the utility of cultural protocols in relation to Indigenous and local knowledge management issues. The focus of the workshop is predominately legal \u2013 and this is quite deliberate. In thinking about the possibilities of protocols and how they can be used as a useful strategy as well as a tool of leverage for Native American communities in the United States, as well as elsewhere, it is critical that there is an inter-linked and robust legal framework that can work in support of the further development of cultural protocols. This will not only contribute to the ability for communities to make informed decisions about how cultural protocols can be effectively utilized, but also provide significant background work in the instances where specific cultural protocols are undermined or delegitimized by third parties.   Balancing Wealth and Health: Access to Medicines in Latin America as a Case Study of the Global Administration of Intellectual Property Law   May 25-26, 2011  Abstract: This Workshop considered the draft report of a project undertaken as part of NYU\u2019s Global Administrative Law (GAL) Network, sponsored by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada and jointly coordinated by the University of the Andes (Colombia) and NYU. The project is aimed at examining, through a series of case studies, the processes and administrative mechanisms that states use internally to negotiate the balance between intellectual property rights and other policy and human rights considerations. Specifically, the case studies focus on intellectual property policies relating to essential medicines in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Central America. The overall goal is to test theories of political opportunity structures, legal transplants and transnational networks in order to map out a nuanced administrative landscape for intellectual property in Latin America that can shed new light on global processes taking place in other regions as well.   Platforms and Power Roundtable   May 6, 2011  Abstract: The Roundtable brought together an interdisciplinary group of scholars of privacy, intellectual property, and the digital society to debate and discuss issues revolving around the relationships between technological platforms and their users, with an eye toward the role that law might play in mediating or structuring these relationships. Roundtable Sessions approached the topic from a variety of angles: Platforms as Fiduciaries (should platform technologies have any duties toward their users?); Platforms as Co-Creators (the role of platforms in the creative activities of their users); Platforms as Regulators (the extent to which platforms should be instruments of regulation of user conduct, either at the behest of government or independently; and Platforms as Social Spaces (the effects of technological platforms on social relationships).

This addiction has driven a vast intergalactic society to commit the biggest copyright violation since the Big Bang. The resulting fines and penalties have bankrupted the whole universe. We humans suddenly own everything-and the aliens are not amused. Nick Carter, a lawyer who knows a thing or two about copyright law, may be the only thing standing between us and total destruction.   book talk information     The Relationship between the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court in the Development of Patent Law   March 13, 2013  Abstract: An informal discussion between Judges Timothy Dyk and Pauline Newman. The interchange should be lively: both are judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with very different ideas about intellectual property policy and theories of adjudication.   Defensive Patent License Project   February 1, 2013  Abstract: The Defensive Patent License (DPL) is a new legal mechanism to protect innovators by networking patents into powerful, mutually-beneficial legal shields that are 100% committed to defending innovation \u2013 no bullies, trolls, or other leeches allowed. It is designed to address the most broken parts of the patent system. The DPL also helps prevent adversaries from patenting open technologies and pulling them out of the public domain. It is an open source-style patent license that seeks to promote the use of patents to encourage freedom to innovate &amp; to operate instead of using them to shut down competition, for rent-seeking, or to inhibit access to knowledge. This approach offers several potential benefits, especially to open innovation communities and/or start-ups: 1) A way to legally bind companies/patents to exclusive defensive use; 2) A way to allow those who are skeptical/critical of the patent system to participate without worry that their innovations will be offensively weaponized; 3) A way to improve prior art by filing defense-oriented patent applications that will preempt future offensive applications; 4) A way to prevent patent trolls from exploiting patents by preemptively committing them to defensive-only use; and 5) A way to provide access to a clear collection of patents that anyone can use for free as long as they are also committed to defensive uses.   Tri-State Region IP Workshop [Third Annual]   January 11, 2013  Abstract: Professors, fellows, visitors, graduate students, and practitioners from the tri-state region presented their works in progress for commentary in a workshop environment. Topics were related to intellectual property or information law. The format involved a series of plenary sessions chaired by a senior commentator. This annual workshop will make it possible for IP and information law scholars located in the tri-state region to get together on a more regular basis to share and discuss each other\u2019s work.   Life as a New IP Associate    October 4, 2012  Abstract: A panel discussion on how to transition from law school to private practice.   Convening Cultural Commons   September 23-24, 2011  Abstract: The purpose of this workshop is to gather scholars from a variety of disciplines who share interests in the study of commons as governance regimes in information, knowledge, and other cultural contexts. The focus will be on institutional analysis of commons, common pool resources, and related institutions for governance of knowledge and information and rights in knowledge and information. Relevant disciplines include law, political science, economics, sociology, organizational science, information science, Science and Technology Studies (STS), and the history of science and technology, among others.   workshop information   Ostrom lecture information   Cultural Protocols Workshop   August 19, 2011  Abstract: This workshop will bring together a small group of legal and cultural scholars to explore the concept and the utility of cultural protocols in relation to Indigenous and local knowledge management issues. The focus of the workshop is predominately legal \u2013 and this is quite deliberate. In thinking about the possibilities of protocols and how they can be used as a useful strategy as well as a tool of leverage for Native American communities in the United States, as well as elsewhere, it is critical that there is an inter-linked and robust legal framework that can work in support of the further development of cultural protocols. This will not only contribute to the ability for communities to make informed decisions about how cultural protocols can be effectively utilized, but also provide significant background work in the instances where specific cultural protocols are undermined or delegitimized by third parties.   Balancing Wealth and Health: Access to Medicines in Latin America as a Case Study of the Global Administration of Intellectual Property Law   May 25-26, 2011  Abstract: This Workshop considered the draft report of a project undertaken as part of NYU\u2019s Global Administrative Law (GAL) Network, sponsored by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada and jointly coordinated by the University of the Andes (Colombia) and NYU. The project is aimed at examining, through a series of case studies, the processes and administrative mechanisms that states use internally to negotiate the balance between intellectual property rights and other policy and human rights considerations. Specifically, the case studies focus on intellectual property policies relating to essential medicines in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Central America. The overall goal is to test theories of political opportunity structures, legal transplants and transnational networks in order to map out a nuanced administrative landscape for intellectual property in Latin America that can shed new light on global processes taking place in other regions as well.   Platforms and Power Roundtable   May 6, 2011  Abstract: The Roundtable brought together an interdisciplinary group of scholars of privacy, intellectual property, and the digital society to debate and discuss issues revolving around the relationships between technological platforms and their users, with an eye toward the role that law might play in mediating or structuring these relationships. Roundtable Sessions approached the topic from a variety of angles: Platforms as Fiduciaries (should platform technologies have any duties toward their users?); Platforms as Co-Creators (the role of platforms in the creative activities of their users); Platforms as Regulators (the extent to which platforms should be instruments of regulation of user conduct, either at the behest of government or independently; and Platforms as Social Spaces (the effects of technological platforms on social relationships).

For the first installment of IPNY, Richard Mendelson and Professor Sprigman will have a lively debate on the role of geographical indications.   50 Years Later: The New York Times v. Sullivan  April 2, 2014   lecture information  Abstract: March 9, 2014 marks the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision on the freedom of the press in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. In the decision, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment protects reports about public officials -- even false ones -- unless they have been made with actual malice (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity). This case allowed much of the press reports on civil rights in the South to move forward. Fifty years later, we convene to consider the implications and lasting significance of the Supreme Court's decision.   Innovation Law &amp; Policy Edit-a-Thon  March 8, 2014   edit-a-thon information  Abstract: The inaugural Innovation Law &amp; Policy Edit-a-thon, co-sponsored by the Engelberg Center on Innovation Law &amp; Policy and the Wikimedia Foundation, brings together a coalition of experienced editors, as well as law professors, activists, and other professionals, to create and improve Wikipedia articles at the intersection of law and policy.

The seminar addresses a variety of perspectives on security in a digital age, including security of information and software, computer networks, cyber-physical systems and infrastructure and will include discussions about national as well as international cyber-security law and policy.   Obfuscation Symposium  February 15, 2014   symposium website  Abstract: The Symposium on Obfuscation will bring together experts from a variety of backgrounds who study, script and design technologies that either simulate, detect, or are susceptible to obfuscation. By obfuscation we mean the production of misleading, ambiguous and plausible but confusing information as an act of concealment or evasion. In the course of the day, we will critically explore and assess the use of obfuscation as a strategy for individuals, groups or communities to hide; to protect themselves; to protest or enact civil disobedience, especially in the context of monitoring, aggregated analysis, and profiling in (digital) space.   Governing Algorithms Conference  May 16-17, 2013   conference website  Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly invoked as powerful entities that control, govern, sort, regulate, and shape everything from financial trades to news media. Nevertheless, the nature and implications of such orderings are far from clear. What exactly is it that algorithms \u201cdo\u201d? What is the role attributed to \u201calgorithms\u201d in these arguments? How can we turn the \u201cproblem of algorithms\u201d into an object of productive inquiry? This conference sets out to explore the recent rise of algorithms as an object of interest in scholarship, policy, and practice.   Workshop on Personal Health Portfolios: Technology, Usability and Policy  February 8, 2013   conference website  Abstract: The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology has defined the PHR as an \u201celectronic record of health-related information on an individual that conforms to nationally recognized interoperability standards and that can be drawn from multiple sources while being managed, shared, and controlled by the individual\u201d (2008:19). Introducing the term \u201cportfolio,\u201d we seek to broaden the initial conceptualization and explore parallels with similar initiatives in other social contexts.   Conference on Mobile and Location Privacy: A Technology and Policy Dialog  April 13, 2012  Abstract: The age of ubiquitous computing is here. People routinely carry smartphones and other devices capable of recording and transmitting immense quantities of personal information and tracking their every move. Privacy has suffered in this new environment, with new reports every week of vulnerabilities and unintended disclosures of private information. The conference aims to bring together the policy and technology communities to discuss the substantial privacy issues arising from the growth of mobile and location technologies.   Platforms and Power Roundtable  May 6, 2011   roundtable information  Abstract: The Roundtable brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars of privacy, intellectual property, and the digital society to debate and discuss issues revolving around the relationships between technological platforms and their users, with an eye toward the role that law might play in mediating or structuring these relationships.

Panelists will begin the day by reviewing current bills and offering an informed analysis and debate concerning the more controversial issues such as preemption, remedies, access and choice, and safe harbors. The morning will continue with a discussion of whether fair information practices (FIPs) should remain the foundation of privacy legislation or need to be modified or abandoned. The afternoon panels will examine emerging issues such as social networking, collective privacy and behavioral advertising and assess how well any proposed bills address these new concerns. There will also be keynote speeches by top FTC officials and participation in panels by key Congressional staffers. Our aim is to achieve meaningful progress toward a well-rounded understanding of pending legislation and perhaps even to resolve some outstanding issues.   Search Privacy Strategy Roundtable  November 8, 2007   Identity and Identification in a Networked World: A Multidisciplinary Graduate Student Symposium  September 29-30, 2006   symposium information  Abstract: Increasingly, who we are is represented by key bits of information scattered throughout the data-intensive, networked world. Online and off, these core identifiers mediate our sense of self, social interactions, movements through space, and access to goods and services. There is much at stake in designing systems of identification and identity management, deciding who or what will be in control of them, and building in adequate protection for our bits of identity permeating the network. This symposium will examine critical and controversial issues surrounding socio-technical systems of identity, identifiability and identification. It will showcase emerging scholarship of graduate students at the cutting edge of humanities, social sciences, artists, systems design &amp; engineering, philosophy, law, and policy to work towards a clearer understanding of these complex problems, and build foundations for future collaborative work. In addition to graduate student panels, a keynote talk will be delivered by Professor Ian Kerr, Canada Research Chair in Ethics, Law &amp; Technology at the University of Ottawa.   A Spyware Workshop  March 16-17, 2006   workshop information  Abstract: A workshop co-sponsored by the Information Law Institute, NYU and Center for Information Technology Policy, Princeton University where experts from academia, industry, government, and public interest advocacy organizations examine spyware in the broader context of computer security, governance of the information infrastructure, and the rights of individual computer-users in relation to public and commercial institutions with which they interact online.
