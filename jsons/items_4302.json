Running February 20\u2013May 12, 2014, Visions+Voices: China includes:   \u2022 Tao Dance Theater\u2019s 4 and the U.S. Premiere of 5 (February 20\u201322); the works continue  choreographer Tao Ye\u2019s journey of pushing the boundaries of corporeal expression.  \u2022 The all-female ensemble Hangzhou Yue Opera Company transform two classic Ibsen plays into lyrical adventures with Hedda (February 25) and The Lady from the Sea (February 26).  \u2022 From March 26-30, the National Theatre of China, one of the new faces of 21st century Chinese theater, will debut a production of Richard III.  \u2022 On April 12, \u201cThe Piano in a Factory,\u201d a film by Zhang Meng, will be screened.  \u2022 The series will close on May 12 with Tan Dun\u2019s The Map performed by the NYU Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Cyr and featuring cellist Wendy Sutter.  \u2022 The series will open with an outdoor vitrine art exhibit featuring the works by Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan (presented in partnership with The Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Wu Jian\u2019an (presented in partnership with Chambers Gallery).   The Visions+Voices Global Performance Series is an annual performing arts series held at the  NYU Skirball Center that creates a unique opportunity to celebrate and closely examine a singular world culture through a wide-ranging artistic lens. This year\u2019s focus is China and highlights several artists who build upon cultural tradition while embracing modern perspectives. NYU Skirball believes that rich international programming not only excites New York audiences and the NYU community, but also serves as a catalyst for international dialogue and education. Celebrating the richness of NYU\u2019s global network of campuses, future seasons include partnerships with Germany, Israel, Abu Dhabi and London.   Michael Harrington, the center\u2019s Executive Director, said, \u201cEach year Visions+Voices gives us the opportunity to explore and highlight the culture and creativity from a featured locale within NYU's Global Network. This year\u2019s Chinese artists and performers will showcase numerous works never before seen in America and we are thrilled to present them here in New York and offer opportunities for cultural discovery and understanding.\u201d   2013-14 marks the tenth season for NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts. In its first decade, NYU Skirball has made substantial contributions not only to the community surrounding the country\u2019s largest private university, but also to a broader cultural landscape. In recent years, Michael Harrington has used the 860-seat venue to provide a platform for artists from around the world to practice their craft on a larger scale from the facility\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood.   In addition to multiple-night and week runs (\u201cCirkopolis,\u201d \u201cOthello,\u201d \u201cWaiting For Godot\u201d), NYU Skirball Center hosts a range of singular events, such as a dialogue between David Byrne &amp; Ahmir &quot;?uestlove&quot; Thompson, and Stephen Sondheim &amp; Tony Kushner, comedians such as Zach Galifianakis and Aziz Ansari, and musicians such as Esperanza Spalding and The Derek Trucks Band.   Tickets for Visions + Voices and the complete NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts season may be purchased online at www.nyuskirball.org, by phone at 212.352.3101 or 866.811.4111, or in person at the NYU Skirball Center Box Office: Tuesday-Saturday, 12-6 p.m. The NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts is located at 566 LaGuardia Place at Washington Square, New York, New York 10012.

Complete listings for the Visions+Voices: China are as follows:   Tao Dance Theater  [Dance]  4 and 5 (U.S. Premiere)  February 20\u201322 at 8pm  $35-$59  75 Minutes   \u201cTao Ye is emerging rapidly as a force to be reckoned with, as well as the most exciting name in  modern dance.\u201d \u2013 Time Out Beijing  One of China\u2019s premiere contemporary dance companies boldly stretches the boundaries of the human physical form.   After a sold out run at the Lincoln Center Festival in 2012, TAO Dance Theater returns with 4, a continuation of choreographer Tao Ye\u2019s exploration of the potential of the human body as a visual element, devoid of story-telling or representation. Four dancers seem to be propelled by a magnetic wave that pulls them apart, and then seems to push them together again, without ever touching.   In the U.S. Premiere of 5, which received standing ovations in Amsterdam at its world premiere, the dancers engage in physical contact, in fact, they move in an indistinguishable kaleidoscopic mass of limbs and light, never dispersing even for a moment.     Hangzhou Yue Opera Company  [Opera]   Hedda (U.S. Premiere)  February 25 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  100 minutes   The Lady from the Sea (U.S. Premiere)  February 26 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  90 minutes   An all female ensemble transforms two Ibsen classics into lyrical and musical adventures, with superbly stylized theatricality in one of the most popular Chinese opera genres.   Performed throughout China and Europe, Hangzhou Yue Opera Company\u2019s contemporary opera adaptations have been well-received across the globe. Hedda (based on Hedda Gabler) focuses on a highly intelligent woman, recently wed for practicality rather than love, whose jealousy leads her down a path to tragedy. The Lady from the Sea also examines a woman in a strained marriage, asked for the first time to truly examine her own desires. The pieces have been adapted to be set in China and their costumes, makeup, symbols and staging reflect a distinctive Chinese sensibility.   Yue Opera, performed by all female actors, is one of the most popular traditional operas in China.  Beginning as a form of storytelling and ballad singing, it has evolved into a theatrical genre with the addition of dramatic structure and an orchestra. Yue Opera is particularly strong in its lyrical touch, with singing and gesturing as its main acting modes. Its arias follow certain patterns, which are delicate and beautiful, reflecting the special aura of southern China.     National Theatre of China (U.S. Company Debut)  [Theater]  Richard III (U.S. Premiere)  March 26\u201330 at 8pm  $39-$65  100 minutes   \u201cIt scores for its intense confrontations and for a fascinating, mercurial villainy that needs no translation.\u201d \u2013 The Arts Desk (UK)   Shakespeare\u2019s tale of ruthless ambition is reinvigorated through a highly dramatized Chinese adaptation where traditional props, wigs, masks, costumes and musical instruments come together to create a horrific world where madness aches for power. Richard III marks National Theatre of China\u2019s first visit to the United States.   This production of Shakespeare's wicked horror-show of power and paranoia, was an audience favorite and critical hit during London\u2019s Globe to Globe Shakespeare festival and Cultural Olympiad in 2012. Performed in Putonghua, or Mandarin, with English supertitles, the plays fundamental themes of desire, power, ambition and jealousy, are potent reminders of humanity\u2019s ongoing struggles. National Theatre of China stages work in three different performance spaces in Beijing and works with the finest playwrights and directors in China. Their trailblazing productions reveal the new face of 21st century Chinese theatre.     THE PIANO IN A FACTORY  (Film)  By Zhang Meng  Presented in partnership with Reel China @ NYU  $15  April 12 at 7pm  105 minutes   \u201cFirst rate cinematography, set design and editing are in perfect sync with the director's comic intent.\u201d - The Hollywood Reporter   Set among the \u201clost generation\u201d of workers in the heavy industrial area in northeastern China who were hit by the policies of reform and economic openness in the 1990s, we see them rekindle their skills and rediscover the joy of working. When Chen\u2019s estranged wife (QIN HAI-LU) reappears asking for a divorce and custody of their daughter, the young musician decides she will live with whoever can provide her a piano. When efforts to borrow money and even steal a piano fail, Chen (WANG QIAN-YUAN) concocts a preposterous plan \u2013 to make a piano from scratch! He persuades a bunch of reluctant but loyal misfit friends to help him forge the instrument in a derelict factory from a heap of scrap steel.     NYU Symphony Orchestra  [Music]  The Map  Composed by Tan Dun  Video designed by Tan Dun  May 12 at 7 p.m.  $15-$35  90 minutes   \u201cTan Dun first attracted attention with skillfully wrought concert works in which ancient Chinese folkloric instruments and techniques mingled in potent collusion with a Western avant-garde vocabulary.\u201d \u2013 New York Times   The NYU Symphony Orchestra will perform Tan Dun\u2019s masterpiece, The Map in a one-night only concert performance. The renowned Chinese composer created the work as a response to his 1999 tour of the eastern part of Hunan Province. The Map was premiered by Yo-Yo Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra and has toured more than 30 countries worldwide. Its manuscript has been included in the Carnegie Hall Composers Gallery. The field video recordings used in The Map capture passionate antiphonal singing, intriguing tongue singing, emphatic percussive dance and other images of ethnic musical life. The interaction of audio-video and live music connected generations and cultures across years and over continents.   A winner of today's most prestigious honors including the Grammy Award (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Tan Dun's music has been played throughout the world by leading orchestras, opera houses, international festivals, and on the radio and television. The one-night only concert performance includes special guests, Grammy-nominated conductor Andrew Cyr and soloist Wendy Sutter heralded as \u201cone of the great leading cellist of the classical stage\u201d by the Wall Street Journal. The evening will also feature Tan Dun\u2019s &quot;Concerto for String Orchestra and Pipa&quot; featuring pipa virtuoso Zhou Yi. Performed by the NYU Symphony Orchestra.   Art Exhibit  Beginning January 20, displayed in numerous large window vitrines found along LaGuardia Place and West 3rd Street, passersby will be able to view the work of contemporary artists Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan and Wu Jian\u2019an. These works by Zhang Jianjun and Zhang Huan are currently on view at The Metropolitan Museum of Art through April 6, 2014, as part of the exhibition Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China. The work by Wu Jian\u2019an is presented in partnership with Chambers Gallery.

In the U.S. Premiere of 5, which received standing ovations in Amsterdam at its world premiere, the dancers engage in physical contact, in fact, they move in an indistinguishable kaleidoscopic mass of limbs and light, never dispersing even for a moment.     Hangzhou Yue Opera Company  [Opera]   Hedda (U.S. Premiere)  February 25 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  100 minutes   The Lady from the Sea (U.S. Premiere)  February 26 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  90 minutes   An all female ensemble transforms two Ibsen classics into lyrical and musical adventures, with superbly stylized theatricality in one of the most popular Chinese opera genres.   Performed throughout China and Europe, Hangzhou Yue Opera Company\u2019s contemporary opera adaptations have been well-received across the globe. Hedda (based on Hedda Gabler) focuses on a highly intelligent woman, recently wed for practicality rather than love, whose jealousy leads her down a path to tragedy. The Lady from the Sea also examines a woman in a strained marriage, asked for the first time to truly examine her own desires. The pieces have been adapted to be set in China and their costumes, makeup, symbols and staging reflect a distinctive Chinese sensibility.   Yue Opera, performed by all female actors, is one of the most popular traditional operas in China.  Beginning as a form of storytelling and ballad singing, it has evolved into a theatrical genre with the addition of dramatic structure and an orchestra. Yue Opera is particularly strong in its lyrical touch, with singing and gesturing as its main acting modes. Its arias follow certain patterns, which are delicate and beautiful, reflecting the special aura of southern China.

Richard III marks National Theatre of China\u2019s first visit to the United States.   This production of Shakespeare's wicked horror-show of power and paranoia, was an audience favorite and critical hit during London\u2019s Globe to Globe Shakespeare festival and Cultural Olympiad in 2012. Performed in Putonghua, or Mandarin, with English supertitles, the plays fundamental themes of desire, power, ambition and jealousy, are potent reminders of humanity\u2019s ongoing struggles. National Theatre of China stages work in three different performance spaces in Beijing and works with the finest playwrights and directors in China. Their trailblazing productions reveal the new face of 21st century Chinese theatre.     THE PIANO IN A FACTORY  (Film)  By Zhang Meng  Presented in partnership with Reel China @ NYU  $15  April 12 at 7pm  105 minutes   \u201cFirst rate cinematography, set design and editing are in perfect sync with the director's comic intent.\u201d - The Hollywood Reporter   Set among the \u201clost generation\u201d of workers in the heavy industrial area in northeastern China who were hit by the policies of reform and economic openness in the 1990s, we see them rekindle their skills and rediscover the joy of working. When Chen\u2019s estranged wife (QIN HAI-LU) reappears asking for a divorce and custody of their daughter, the young musician decides she will live with whoever can provide her a piano. When efforts to borrow money and even steal a piano fail, Chen (WANG QIAN-YUAN) concocts a preposterous plan \u2013 to make a piano from scratch! He persuades a bunch of reluctant but loyal misfit friends to help him forge the instrument in a derelict factory from a heap of scrap steel.

The Map was premiered by Yo-Yo Ma and the Boston Symphony Orchestra and has toured more than 30 countries worldwide. Its manuscript has been included in the Carnegie Hall Composers Gallery. The field video recordings used in The Map capture passionate antiphonal singing, intriguing tongue singing, emphatic percussive dance and other images of ethnic musical life. The interaction of audio-video and live music connected generations and cultures across years and over continents.   A winner of today's most prestigious honors including the Grammy Award (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Tan Dun's music has been played throughout the world by leading orchestras, opera houses, international festivals, and on the radio and television. The one-night only concert performance includes special guests, Grammy-nominated conductor Andrew Cyr and soloist Wendy Sutter heralded as \u201cone of the great leading cellist of the classical stage\u201d by the Wall Street Journal.

Almost entirely self-taught as a composer, he studied classics at Harvard (BA, PhD), remaining there as a teacher until 1970. Between 1970 and 2000, Wolff was the Strauss Professor of Music at Dartmouth College where he also taught classics. Wolff&sup1;s honours include an award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and several commissions, notably those from West German Radio, the Concord String Quartet, the Wesleyan Singers and Ursula Oppens.       A particular interest in Wolff's work has been to allow performers flexibility and ranges of freedom at the actual time of a piece's performance; to devise notations to make this practicable; to foster among both professional and lay players a spirit of liberating interdependence; and to draw material from traditions of popular political music.       Wolff described his compositional interests in the following manner: \"To turn the making of music into a collaborative and transforming activity    (performer into composer into listener into composer into performer, etc.), the cooperative character of the activity to the exact source of the music. To stir up, through the production of the music, a sense of social conditions in which we live and of how these might be changed.\"                         An Afternoon with ZANANA    (Kristin Norderval &amp; Monique Buzzart&eacute;)    Thursday, January 27 at 5:30 pm  220 Silver Center, NYU        Zanana (za-NAH-na) is a collaborative duo featuring Kristin Norderval and Monique Buzzart&eacute; performing improvised music blending acoustic sounds, electronics and live processing. The duo takes its name from a variant spelling of \"zenana,\" the portion of a house in southwestern Asian countries exclusively dedicated to women. For live processing the duo uses  Macintosh laptop computers running Max/MSP. Zanana utilizes hemispherical/ spherical speakers that diffuse the electronic sounds much like an acoustical instrument, thereby creating dynamic and surprising interplay between acoustic and electronic sounds. Both Norderval and Buzzart&eacute; are certified to teach the meditative improvisation techniques of Deep Listening, and use these techniques to inform their performances and to inspire new ways of listening and conceiving of sound. Zanana's debut CD Holding Patterns was released in January 2005 on the Deep Listening label with support from the The Aaron Copland Fund for Music Recording Program through the Pauline Oliveros Foundation.

The Visions+Voices Global Performance Series is an annual performing arts series held at the  NYU Skirball Center that creates a unique opportunity to celebrate and closely examine a singular world culture through a wide-ranging artistic lens. This year\u2019s focus is China and highlights several artists who build upon cultural tradition while embracing modern perspectives. NYU Skirball believes that rich international programming not only excites New York audiences and the NYU community, but also serves as a catalyst for international dialogue and education. Celebrating the richness of NYU\u2019s global network of campuses, future seasons include partnerships with Germany, Israel, Abu Dhabi and London.   Michael Harrington, the center\u2019s Executive Director, said, \u201cEach year Visions+Voices gives us the opportunity to explore and highlight the culture and creativity from a featured locale within NYU's Global Network. This year\u2019s Chinese artists and performers will showcase numerous works never before seen in America and we are thrilled to present them here in New York and offer opportunities for cultural discovery and understanding.\u201d   2013-14 marks the tenth season for NYU Skirball Center for the Performing Arts. In its first decade, NYU Skirball has made substantial contributions not only to the community surrounding the country\u2019s largest private university, but also to a broader cultural landscape. In recent years, Michael Harrington has used the 860-seat venue to provide a platform for artists from around the world to practice their craft on a larger scale from the facility\u2019s Greenwich Village neighborhood.   In addition to multiple-night and week runs (\u201cCirkopolis,\u201d \u201cOthello,\u201d \u201cWaiting For Godot\u201d), NYU Skirball Center hosts a range of singular events, such as a dialogue between David Byrne &amp; Ahmir &quot;?uestlove&quot; Thompson, and Stephen Sondheim &amp; Tony Kushner, comedians such as Zach Galifianakis and Aziz Ansari, and musicians such as Esperanza Spalding and The Derek Trucks Band.

Complete listings for the Visions+Voices: China are as follows:   Tao Dance Theater  [Dance]  4 and 5 (U.S. Premiere)  February 20\u201322 at 8pm  $35-$59  75 Minutes   \u201cTao Ye is emerging rapidly as a force to be reckoned with, as well as the most exciting name in  modern dance.\u201d \u2013 Time Out Beijing  One of China\u2019s premiere contemporary dance companies boldly stretches the boundaries of the human physical form.   After a sold out run at the Lincoln Center Festival in 2012, TAO Dance Theater returns with 4, a continuation of choreographer Tao Ye\u2019s exploration of the potential of the human body as a visual element, devoid of story-telling or representation. Four dancers seem to be propelled by a magnetic wave that pulls them apart, and then seems to push them together again, without ever touching.   In the U.S. Premiere of 5, which received standing ovations in Amsterdam at its world premiere, the dancers engage in physical contact, in fact, they move in an indistinguishable kaleidoscopic mass of limbs and light, never dispersing even for a moment.     Hangzhou Yue Opera Company  [Opera]   Hedda (U.S. Premiere)  February 25 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  100 minutes   The Lady from the Sea (U.S. Premiere)  February 26 at 8 p.m.  $28-$38  90 minutes   An all female ensemble transforms two Ibsen classics into lyrical and musical adventures, with superbly stylized theatricality in one of the most popular Chinese opera genres.   Performed throughout China and Europe, Hangzhou Yue Opera Company\u2019s contemporary opera adaptations have been well-received across the globe. Hedda (based on Hedda Gabler) focuses on a highly intelligent woman, recently wed for practicality rather than love, whose jealousy leads her down a path to tragedy. The Lady from the Sea also examines a woman in a strained marriage, asked for the first time to truly examine her own desires. The pieces have been adapted to be set in China and their costumes, makeup, symbols and staging reflect a distinctive Chinese sensibility.   Yue Opera, performed by all female actors, is one of the most popular traditional operas in China.  Beginning as a form of storytelling and ballad singing, it has evolved into a theatrical genre with the addition of dramatic structure and an orchestra. Yue Opera is particularly strong in its lyrical touch, with singing and gesturing as its main acting modes. Its arias follow certain patterns, which are delicate and beautiful, reflecting the special aura of southern China.     National Theatre of China (U.S. Company Debut)  [Theater]  Richard III (U.S. Premiere)  March 26\u201330 at 8pm  $39-$65  100 minutes   \u201cIt scores for its intense confrontations and for a fascinating, mercurial villainy that needs no translation.\u201d \u2013 The Arts Desk (UK)   Shakespeare\u2019s tale of ruthless ambition is reinvigorated through a highly dramatized Chinese adaptation where traditional props, wigs, masks, costumes and musical instruments come together to create a horrific world where madness aches for power. Richard III marks National Theatre of China\u2019s first visit to the United States.

THE PIANO IN A FACTORY  (Film)  By Zhang Meng  Presented in partnership with Reel China @ NYU  $15  April 12 at 7pm  105 minutes   \u201cFirst rate cinematography, set design and editing are in perfect sync with the director's comic intent.\u201d - The Hollywood Reporter   Set among the \u201clost generation\u201d of workers in the heavy industrial area in northeastern China who were hit by the policies of reform and economic openness in the 1990s, we see them rekindle their skills and rediscover the joy of working. When Chen\u2019s estranged wife (QIN HAI-LU) reappears asking for a divorce and custody of their daughter, the young musician decides she will live with whoever can provide her a piano. When efforts to borrow money and even steal a piano fail, Chen (WANG QIAN-YUAN) concocts a preposterous plan \u2013 to make a piano from scratch! He persuades a bunch of reluctant but loyal misfit friends to help him forge the instrument in a derelict factory from a heap of scrap steel.

Almost entirely self-taught as a composer, he studied classics at Harvard (BA, PhD), remaining there as a teacher until 1970. Between 1970 and 2000, Wolff was the Strauss Professor of Music at Dartmouth College where he also taught classics. Wolff&sup1;s honours include an award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and several commissions, notably those from West German Radio, the Concord String Quartet, the Wesleyan Singers and Ursula Oppens.       A particular interest in Wolff's work has been to allow performers flexibility and ranges of freedom at the actual time of a piece's performance; to devise notations to make this practicable; to foster among both professional and lay players a spirit of liberating interdependence; and to draw material from traditions of popular political music.       Wolff described his compositional interests in the following manner: \"To turn the making of music into a collaborative and transforming activity    (performer into composer into listener into composer into performer, etc.), the cooperative character of the activity to the exact source of the music. To stir up, through the production of the music, a sense of social conditions in which we live and of how these might be changed.\"                         An Afternoon with ZANANA    (Kristin Norderval &amp; Monique Buzzart&eacute;)    Thursday, January 27 at 5:30 pm  220 Silver Center, NYU        Zanana (za-NAH-na) is a collaborative duo featuring Kristin Norderval and Monique Buzzart&eacute; performing improvised music blending acoustic sounds, electronics and live processing. The duo takes its name from a variant spelling of \"zenana,\" the portion of a house in southwestern Asian countries exclusively dedicated to women. For live processing the duo uses  Macintosh laptop computers running Max/MSP. Zanana utilizes hemispherical/ spherical speakers that diffuse the electronic sounds much like an acoustical instrument, thereby creating dynamic and surprising interplay between acoustic and electronic sounds. Both Norderval and Buzzart&eacute; are certified to teach the meditative improvisation techniques of Deep Listening, and use these techniques to inform their performances and to inspire new ways of listening and conceiving of sound. Zanana's debut CD Holding Patterns was released in January 2005 on the Deep Listening label with support from the The Aaron Copland Fund for Music Recording Program through the Pauline Oliveros Foundation.

The Kod&aacute;ly Summer Institute is endorsed by the Organization of American Kod&aacute;ly Educators .    Kod&aacute;ly &amp; Music Education    Following his folk-song collecting with B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k in Hungary in the early 1900s, Zolt&aacute;n Kod&aacute;ly had a vision&mdash;a monumental idea that music, like language, could be taught artistically using the authentic traditional (folk) materials of any given culture. Gathering talented, creative teachers around him, Kod&aacute;ly developed a philosophy:    Music is at the core of the curriculum. The ancient Greeks believed that music was at the center of all learning, because music was a natural synthesis of thinking, feeling, and moving.    The body&mdash;singing voice, body idiophones, and movement&mdash;is the best medium for making music. The body and the voice are custom made for every individual. Song and movement are united in traditional (folk) games and dances. Singing with confidence is a main goal.    Traditional (folk) musics leading to other musics are the best materials for becoming literate in Western music. Everyone has a mother tongue&mdash;the language spoken at home. The traditional (folk) music of that language should be the song source from which the facts and concepts of music literacy are drawn. In a complex culture, such as that in the United States, any music of a culture group or subculture group should be considered. In Kod&aacute;ly practice the repertory of materials should take four directions:       Preservation of authentic traditional (folk) songs of the native culture(s).    Exploration of musics of other cultures.    Bridging traditional (folk) songs with all styles of composed music.    Exploration of both historical and living traditions.       Music literacy is like language literacy. Everyone has the ability to hear, speak, read, and write a language. Therefore, everyone has the ability to hear, sing, read, and write music. Music literacy is something that everyone can and should enjoy. Music literacy is the first step of analysis toward the goal of musical understanding.    Quality music is the best material for teaching. Kod&aacute;ly believed that only the best music by the greatest composers and traditional (folk) music most representative of the culture are good enough for children.    Experiencing music&mdash;hearing, developing skills, preparing to derive concepts&mdash;cannot begin too early. Kod&aacute;ly said music training should begin \"nine months before the birth of the mother.\"    The Kod&aacute;ly philosophy has been adapted worldwide. Emphasis on the continuing upgrade of the teacher's own musicianship continues to be a strong feature of this movement. It is a living philosophy constantly being reshaped by research in how children learn music in cultural settings. Kod&aacute;ly's vision complements the emerging focus on world musics by today's musician-educators.
