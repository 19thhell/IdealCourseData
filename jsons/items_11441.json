Check back in May 2015 for updates on a 2016 offering.   2013 dates were: Tuesday, January 1 (arrival day) - Sunday, January 13 (departure day), 2013. First day of class is Thursday, January 3, last day of class is Saturday, January 12. Note: The course begins on the evening of Wednesday, January 2 with a welcome at the hotel.   The Course   PADM-GP 2201 | Syllabus   International development is a hotly contested and highly politicized field. This course carves out a narrow slice of this large pie and introduces students to the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing countries. It gives special emphasis to the case of Brazil. Throughout the 20th century, and similar to many other developing nations, Brazil has experienced deep economic transformations. Moreover, in recent decades it has enacted a range of institutional reforms to promote social inclusion, environmental protection, and business growth. Despite marked success in a number of areas, the country still struggles to promote good governance, empower its citizenry, create jobs, and raise millions out of poverty.   What can we learn from these experiences? It would be nice if we could isolate blueprints, pre-packaged tools, formulas and other ready-to-use frameworks. Unfortunately, these resources rarely work as intended. Rather, this course encourages students to analyze the theories that underpin existing initiatives, identify principles of action, and use their policy imagination to adapt findings to other contexts. A combination of lectures, class discussions, exercises, and field visits will help in this task.   This course is a joint activity of NYU Wagner and the School of Management and the Collective Health Institute (ISC) at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). Brazilian and US-based students and faculty will participate in all activities and all instruction will be conducted in English.   Portuguese language skills will be useful but are not required.

Check back in May 2015 for updates on a 2016 offering.   2013 dates were: Tuesday, January 1 (arrival day) - Sunday, January 13 (departure day), 2013. First day of class is Thursday, January 3, last day of class is Saturday, January 12. Note: The course begins on the evening of Wednesday, January 2 with a welcome at the hotel.   The Course   PADM-GP 2201 | Syllabus   International development is a hotly contested and highly politicized field. This course carves out a narrow slice of this large pie and introduces students to the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing countries. It gives special emphasis to the case of Brazil. Throughout the 20th century, and similar to many other developing nations, Brazil has experienced deep economic transformations. Moreover, in recent decades it has enacted a range of institutional reforms to promote social inclusion, environmental protection, and business growth. Despite marked success in a number of areas, the country still struggles to promote good governance, empower its citizenry, create jobs, and raise millions out of poverty.   What can we learn from these experiences? It would be nice if we could isolate blueprints, pre-packaged tools, formulas and other ready-to-use frameworks. Unfortunately, these resources rarely work as intended. Rather, this course encourages students to analyze the theories that underpin existing initiatives, identify principles of action, and use their policy imagination to adapt findings to other contexts. A combination of lectures, class discussions, exercises, and field visits will help in this task.   This course is a joint activity of NYU Wagner and the School of Management and the Collective Health Institute (ISC) at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). Brazilian and US-based students and faculty will participate in all activities and all instruction will be conducted in English.   Portuguese language skills will be useful but are not required.   Visit UFBA's website for photos of the campus and facilities.

Next offering is August 2016.    This course analyzes the historical and cultural contingency of race-based affirmative action policies in Brazil and to analyze the broader contemporary controversies and social implications of the globalization of higher education.    Brazil has the largest (and by most measures, best) higher education system in Latin America, and enrollments have undergone explosive growth over the last 20 years. We begin with an historical overview then move to an analysis of contemporary issues. Students gain an understanding of the variety of higher education institutions in Brazil (federal and state public institutions, private non-profit and private for-profit universities, etc.) and become familiar with issues of internationalization in higher education, faculty and student mobility, research in a global context, variation among public versus private universities and their economic structures, the role of foreign university partnerships, and other higher education issues.    As a major focus, we use race &ndash; an extremely context-dependent ideology &ndash; as a main entry point into an examination of Brazilian higher education. Brazil began to implement affirmative action policies in 2003, stoking enormous cultural, legal, and education debates. At the same time, there were also huge changes in funding and government oversight at universities. The terms of the debates around access to higher education are different in Brazil and the United States, and the stakes and stakeholders are different, but the intensity of the issue is very high.
