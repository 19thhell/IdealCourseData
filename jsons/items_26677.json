Or should administrators even ask about the gender of prospective roommates? Some colleges experiment with \"gender-blind\" dorms          By        Jordan Mazza         (~1046 Words)                    jpm468&#64;gmail&#46;com                                    [Images Attached]                           NEW YORK &#8212; You and your best friend are the perfect match. You share countless qualities: you both like to go to bed early, stay organized, listen to Lady Gaga even eat cold pizza. But one of the few qualities you do not share is gender, and according to your schools housing policy, this means you cannot share a room either.    Such a scenario is increasingly common for college students across America. LGBT rights advocates say that traditional housing arrangements, which require that roommates identify as the same gender, are antiquated and unfair. Some straight students insist that they should be allowed to room regardless of gender, platonically or in a relationship. But many parents, students, and officials assert that the traditional policy is necessary to regulate student behavior.    This year, though, more than 30 colleges nationwide are launching unprecedented gender-neutral, or gender blind, housing policies. Such a policy permits upperclassmen to select their own roommates, with no restrictions on gender. Participating schools include Cornell, Stanford, Sarah Lawrence, the University of Michigan, and Dartmouth.    Jeffrey Chang is the co-founder of the National Student Genderblind Campaign, a grassroots advocacy organization for gender-neutral and LGBT -affirmative policies on college campuses. The groups website calls traditional housing policies relics of an outdated pasta time when all students were assumed to be straight, transgender and queer identities were brushed aside, and friendships between men and women were less common.    Columbia University is one school currently debating gender-neutral housing. Sean Udell is the president of the Columbia College Class of 2011 and leader of the Columbia Genderblind Housing Initiative. He said the newly-proposed policy goes beyond those gay males and straight females most comfortable in a Will &amp; Grace-style existence.    Our policy is first and foremost for transgender and gender-nonconforming students who dont feel comfortable with the current housing options, Udell said. This is taking gender out of the equation.    The groups initial policy proposal in December 2009 attracted considerable attention from local and national media, much of it negative. The first line of a New York Post article said Columbia students would be living in sin on their parents dime. The article also mentioned a parent who threatened to remove her son from housing as a result of the policy.    The media didnt get it. The Post clearly had a moral agenda, Udell said. His organizations website directly responds to the living in sin notion, pointing out that the current policy allows homosexual couples to live together, and the implementation of this [new] policy would eliminate a double standard.    The Columbia proposal passed almost unanimously in the universitys student senate. But just days before housing selection began in February, Dean of Students Kevin Shollenberger announced the policy would not be considered, due to insufficient student support. In response, the Columbia Genderblind Housing Initiative collected more than 1,000 student signatures for a petition, and hopes to draft a new proposal by September.    They just dont want to bother explaining this to incoming freshmen and parents, Udell said of his universitys decision to reject the policy.    Though gender-blind housing is generally not available to freshmen, who are assigned roommates, some parents of incoming students are wary of the option.  As a dad, Id feel a little awkward about it, said Bill Clarke of Bedford, N.Y., whose daughter is a prospective New York University student. The university currently allows mixed-sex suitemates, and is considering offering genderblind rooms.    It should be a kids choice, but then again theyre still kids, said one mother of another prospective NYU student who wished to remain anonymous. I would trust my son, but Im not sure everyones mature enough.    Columbia and NYU may look to the almost 50 colleges nationwide that have implemented some form of genderblind housing, including many in the last year.  Ross Maxwell is the housing services coordinator at Occidental College in Los Angeles, which introduced three gender-neutral rooms in 2009.    Weve expanded it quite a bit this year and added a lot more rooms, Maxwell said. So far, we havent had a whole lot of complaints, but I think it helps that our institution is small and our student body is more liberal.    Yet the idea of co-ed roommates irks some students and officials at other colleges.  I would be afraid as a male that if I had conflicts, the female would always win, and say I tried to sexually harass them, said Mark Cubbage, a junior at Bridgewater College in Bridgewater, Va. And it makes relationships between heterosexual couples awkward. Can you imagine having a girlfriend and her suspicions about your female roommate?    According to a recent study by Dr. Brian Willoughby, professor in the School of Family Life at Brigham Young University, co-ed dorms seem to be associated with higher levels of risk-taking activities like binge drinking.    Willoughby predicts co-ed rooms might force universities to handle notoriously unstable college relationships.    Housing offices with co-ed rooms are likely going to be faced with attempting to relocate individuals who have broken up with their roommate, Willoughby said. Some universities have tried to get around this by requiring students to sign a release claiming they will not enter into a relationship with their roommates, but we can probably all guess how effective that will be.    Chang said that at colleges that offer gender-blind housing, few participating residents are couples.    Most students are smart enough to know not to live together if theyre in a relationship, said Monroe France, director of the Office of LGBT Student Services at NYU and leading advocate of the universitys gender-blind housing proposal.    Dr. Gayatri Gopinath, director of Gender and Sexuality Studies at NYU, said she believes gender-blind housing embodies a logical evolution from earlier movements.    Gender-blind housing should absolutely be an option, Gopinath said. Early feminism was about womens empowerment, and this is a great progression to transgender empowerment. But we should remember that some people prefer the dynamic of single-sex housing.    Im sure theres some social value to the traditional policy, Udell said. But really its about choice. Everyone at this school is an adult, and should be able to make decisions for themselves.    Jordan Mazza studies journalism at New York University.                      A movement to allow college students to choose roommates of either gender is spreading.

The program is dedicated to training future leaders, endowing them with the skills and experience to advance reconciliation and coexistence for future generations.   The academic objective of Paths to Peace is to focus on the historical, political, cultural, and religious relationships between Israelis and Palestinians. All students in the program will be required to take two mandatory courses, together with NYU students, one on Israel and one on Palestine. They will also participate in two weekly workshops to be held on two separate days and to be conducted by experienced Palestinian and Israeli facilitators. Workshop participants will engage in an in-depth process of exploration, observation and analysis of the conflict and will have the opportunity to gain important insights into their identities as well as the dynamics of groups in conflict.   Students will be allowed to select up to two additional courses based on their own academic interests. These courses should be selected from the University's undergraduate college of Arts and Science or American Language Institute (if further English language training is required based on your level at the start of the program).   Program participants will attend off-campus excursions, such as visits to the UN Headquarters, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, and a weekend in Washington, DC. Each student is expected and required to participate fully in the program and to attend all classes and activities comprising the program. In the event that the University determines, in its sole discretion, that a student has failed to meet the required standard of participation, the student will be subject to immediate dismissal from the program and will be required to return to his/her country of origin.   Questions about the program? Email paths.to.peace@nyu.edu .                       Applications to participate in Paths to Peace for either fall 2015 semester or spring 2016 semester are currently being accepted. Fall 2015 semester is from August 25 \u2013 December 23, 2015. Spring semester is from January 19 \u2013 May 17, 2016. Successful candidates are required to arrive on time for the start of the program and return home at the end of their semester at NYU. You are eligible to apply if you:   * have lived most of your life in Israel, Gaza Palestinian Territories or West Bank Palestinian Territories.   *are currently registered full time and are in good academic standing at the bachelor\u2019s/undergraduate level at an accredited college or university in Israel or Palestine AND you anticipate completion of studies in 2017 or after.   *you were born on or between the following dates: September 2, 1990 \u2013 September 1, 1996. This means that you are not younger than 19 years and not older than 24 years as of September 1, 2015.   Successful applicants will receive a scholarship to cover tuition, room and board, health insurance, books, travel, and a small living stipend for the academic semester. Additionally, successful applicants we identify as needing to improve their English language skills will be able to attend supplementary language courses prior to departing for New York.   The application deadline is Friday, February 13, 2015. Your application will not be considered unless it is complete.   Applicants from Israel should contact Dr. Keynan at irit.keynan@nyu.edu with further questions or to request an application form.
