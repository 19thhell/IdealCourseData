This page is my old academic website.   My research interests are in networked systems with a focus on securities. I have worked on distributed systems, security and privacy, storage systems, and databases.  I am fortunated to be advised by Jinyang Li and  Lakshminarayanan Subramanian .  Previously, I got a B.S. in Computer Science (1st class honor) with a Minor degree  in Mathematics from National University of  Singapore in 2005. I worked with professor  Y.C. Tay and professor  T.S. Tan in some system  projects.       I am currently supported by the 2010 Google PhD fellowship in Distributed Systems.    Research       SumUp  A Sybil-resilient mechanism for collecting user votes in online content voting system.             Online voting system likes Diggs, YouTube, eBay, Amazon, ets are known to be susceptible to Sybil attack in which the attacker creates many accounts to cast bogus votes for an object. SumUp leverages social network underline the accounts to defend against such attack. By using a novel capacity assignment on the social links and collecting votes in an approximate max-flow fashion, SumUp can successfully limits the number of bogus votes casted by the attacker to the number of attack edges (e_A) with high probability. SumUp also leverage users' feedback to further reduce the number of bogus votes casted by the attacker if the attacker keeps doing that for different objects. Using SumUp on Digg voting trace, we found evidences of Sybil attacks in real world.           Friendstore   A P2P backup and file sharing system that use social network as resource to improve reliablity and availability.             Building backup system using traditional P2P model is difficult, if not infeasible, due to churn. To address this issue, Friendstore leverages real social relationships between nodes. Friendstore's argument is that real social relationship provides sufficient incentive for nodes to stay in the system and keep data for other nodes, which is crucial to backup application. In Friendstore, a node only stores data on its trusted peers which are its trusted friends in real life. We formulate the amount of data a node can backup and help other nodes to backup base on its uplink capacity. Our simulation shows that, under wide area network condition, a node in Friendstore can backup 300GB safely over a long period, i.e. 5 years. We also develop a coding scheme XOR(1,2) that helps nodes, that have redundant bandwidth, to trade bandwidth for additional storage capacity. Try it out!

This page is my old academic website.   My research interests are in networked systems with a focus on securities. I have worked on distributed systems, security and privacy, storage systems, and databases.  I am fortunated to be advised by Jinyang Li and  Lakshminarayanan Subramanian .  Previously, I got a B.S. in Computer Science (1st class honor) with a Minor degree  in Mathematics from National University of  Singapore in 2005. I worked with professor  Y.C. Tay and professor  T.S. Tan in some system  projects.       I am currently supported by the 2010 Google PhD fellowship in Distributed Systems.    Research       SumUp  A Sybil-resilient mechanism for collecting user votes in online content voting system.             Online voting system likes Diggs, YouTube, eBay, Amazon, ets are known to be susceptible to Sybil attack in which the attacker creates many accounts to cast bogus votes for an object. SumUp leverages social network underline the accounts to defend against such attack. By using a novel capacity assignment on the social links and collecting votes in an approximate max-flow fashion, SumUp can successfully limits the number of bogus votes casted by the attacker to the number of attack edges (e_A) with high probability. SumUp also leverage users' feedback to further reduce the number of bogus votes casted by the attacker if the attacker keeps doing that for different objects. Using SumUp on Digg voting trace, we found evidences of Sybil attacks in real world.           Friendstore   A P2P backup and file sharing system that use social network as resource to improve reliablity and availability.             Building backup system using traditional P2P model is difficult, if not infeasible, due to churn. To address this issue, Friendstore leverages real social relationships between nodes. Friendstore's argument is that real social relationship provides sufficient incentive for nodes to stay in the system and keep data for other nodes, which is crucial to backup application. In Friendstore, a node only stores data on its trusted peers which are its trusted friends in real life. We formulate the amount of data a node can backup and help other nodes to backup base on its uplink capacity. Our simulation shows that, under wide area network condition, a node in Friendstore can backup 300GB safely over a long period, i.e. 5 years. We also develop a coding scheme XOR(1,2) that helps nodes, that have redundant bandwidth, to trade bandwidth for additional storage capacity. Try it out!
