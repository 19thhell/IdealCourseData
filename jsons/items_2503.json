Those are the skills taught by the Moral Courage Project (MCP) at NYU Wagner. By developing mastery of the self, leadership through relationships, and strategies for action in moral dilemmas, graduates can ensure both integrity and impact.   Moral Courage in the 21st Century   Moral courage means standing up when others want you to sit down.   Developing moral courage is crucial to authenticity of the self. It equips individuals to discover what is true about their voices, allowing them to deepen that uniqueness. It also empowers individuals to discover what matters to them\u00a0-\u00a0what they stand for -\u00a0even if the price is disapproval from peers or loved ones.   These are central issues for emerging professionals\u00a0today. Humanity's future demands creativity, which in turn requires students to find and cultivate their callings. Purpose and meaning are no longer luxuries; they are necessities in the roller-coaster ride that is a contemporary career. Whether as entrepreneurs, as social change agents, or as both, having impact requires taking risks for life-changing rewards.\u00a0     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     Course Offering:\u00a0 Moral Courage and Your Purpose (PADM-GP 2196)   The Moral Courage Project will\u00a0offer\u00a0its next graduate-level course in the J-term 2015.\u00a0Developed by Irshad Manji , this seminar-style course is driven by Socratic questioning.

Indeed, the mere act of assigning people to groups is sufficient to evoke identification with fellow ingroup members and discrimination that favors ingroup over outgroup members. This intergroup discrimination occurs in the absence of any factors typically posited to account for intergroup bias, such as stereotypes, prior contact with group members or competition over resources (Tajfel, 1970). Moreover, when a given social identity is salient, people are more likely to perceive themselves and others as interchangeable exemplars of a social category rather than unique individuals. Our research explores how this process of self-categorization colors social perceptions and evaluations of the self and others in line with the values and contents associated with the current social identity (Turner, Oakes, Haslam, &amp; McGarty, 1994).   Our latest research explores the effects of self-categorization and social identity on cognition \u2014 from low-level perception and evaluation to social memory \u2013 across multiple levels-of-analysis. For example, we have assigned participants to a mixed-race team to test whether social perception and evaluation reflect the current relevant social identity even when other social categories are visually and socially salient. This research has shown that although racial biases are normally automatically activated, this process is not inevitable, and people can flexibly (and automatically) categorize and evaluate others according to other social dimensions, including the most minimal of social identities. We are currently extending this work to explore the effects of social identity on attention, perception, memory, consciousness, awareness and behavior, and trying to identify the neural mediators of these processes. We believe these studies will not only extend our understanding of social identity but may change our understanding of the social brain.   Social Categories and Psychophysiology   There is extensive evidence of racial disparities in health, including evidence that African Americans suffer from cardiovascular problems relative to Caucasian Americans. Although this issue has largely been considered from a medical perspective, my collaborators and I are interested in exploring whether social factors such as the perception of threat inherent in interracial contexts may play a role in producing these disparities. We are especially interested in the role of social identity in generating these disparities, and whether changing cognitions can reduce perceived threat and therefore attenuate racial disparities in cardiovascular responses.   MORAL COGNITION   The causes and consequences of moral construal   Models of moral decision-making generally propose a multistage process: the first involves determining that a situation is morally-relevant and that it should be evaluated in moral terms ( moral construal ); the second involves the application of moral decision-rules or reasoned principles to the situation in order to determine the morally right or wrong course of action ( moral judgment ). Most psychological research on morality has examined the second of these steps, confronting na\u00efve participants with moral dilemmas, and on the basis of their reactions making inferences about the nature of the decision-rules and reasoning processes that are applied to situations deemed morally relevant. However, if moral construal and judgment are separable, a particular behavior or course of action may be evaluated in both moral and non-moral terms. This is important, in part, because it helps to account for a particular type of moral failure, in which people make immoral decisions not because they intend to do so, but because they fail to recognize the moral implications of a course of action. Hannah Arendt famously described the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann as embodying the \u2018banality of evil\u2019, meaning that Eichmann had given no consideration to the moral implications of his actions, and had participated in the killing of many thousands of Jews for purely pragmatic reasons.\u00a0My collaborators and I are currently examining the flexibility of moral construal. Initial studies indicate that people can process and evaluate a host of issues according to moral standards and that moral processes may lead to systematic biases in decision-making and behavior, including extremism.   The psychology of hate   Throughout human history, the most heinous and heroic acts have been committed in the service of morality. It is therefore unsurprising that philosophers and scientists have long argued that hate stems from moral values (Aristotle, 350 BCE). Despite the immense theoretical and real-world significance of hate, there have been very few studies on the psychological underpinnings of hate, and none to determine whether hate differs from basic negative attitudes (i.e., dislike). To address this paucity of research, my collaborators and I have been conducting a series of studies to determine whether hate is quantitatively and/or qualitatively different from dislike. Our initial research indicates that hated people, objects and issues are not only more negative, but they are also more strongly associated with moral beliefs and emotions (e.g., contempt) and less strongly associated with empathy than disliked targets. Our initial research also suggests that hate motivates individuals to act destructively in the service of their moral beliefs or ideology. We are currently exploring whether hate is associated with destructive approach-related motivations whereas dislike is associated with avoidance-related motivations.   SCIENTIFIC APPROACH   \u201cIf social scientists choose to select rigorous theory as their ultimate goal, as have the natural scientists, they will succeed to the extent they traverse broad stretches of time and space. That means nothing less than aligning their explanations with those of the natural sciences.\u201d \u2013 E. O. Wilson (1998)   My lab takes a multi-level approach to human psychology, blending theory and methods from social psychology and affective neuroscience. This approach is based on the assumption that complex social phenomena are best understood by combining social and biological theory and methods (Cacioppo, Berntson, Sheridan, &amp; McClintock, 2000). This approach involves breaking phenomena like social perception and evaluation into component processes to better understand the operating characteristics of these components and how they work in concert. Analyzing these phenomena across multiple levels-of-analysis offers the promise of developing more general, process-oriented theories of human cognition and developing novel interventions for pressing social issues.   The NYU Department of Psychology is ideally equipped to conduct research using a social and affective neuroscience approach. The Department of Psychology, in collaboration with the Center for Brain Imaging, offers lab space for conducting behavioral studies (including social cognition protocols), several electroencephalography (EEG) systems (including high-density 128-channel EEG), eye-tracking capabilities and a Siemens Allegra 3T head-only scanner. Students also have access to an imaging lab outfitted with four Linux machines that have all the current post processing software and programs needed for neuroscience analysis and regular in-house training seminars on cutting-edge data collection and analysis techniques in cognitive neuroscience.

Those are the skills taught by the Moral Courage Project (MCP) at NYU Wagner. By developing mastery of the self, leadership through relationships, and strategies for action in moral dilemmas, graduates can ensure both integrity and impact.   Moral Courage in the 21st Century   Moral courage means standing up when others want you to sit down.   Developing moral courage is crucial to authenticity of the self. It equips individuals to discover what is true about their voices, allowing them to deepen that uniqueness. It also empowers individuals to discover what matters to them\u00a0-\u00a0what they stand for -\u00a0even if the price is disapproval from peers or loved ones.   These are central issues for emerging professionals\u00a0today. Humanity's future demands creativity, which in turn requires students to find and cultivate their callings. Purpose and meaning are no longer luxuries; they are necessities in the roller-coaster ride that is a contemporary career. Whether as entrepreneurs, as social change agents, or as both, having impact requires taking risks for life-changing rewards.\u00a0     \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     Course Offering:\u00a0 Moral Courage and Your Purpose (PADM-GP 2196)   The Moral Courage Project will\u00a0offer\u00a0its next graduate-level course in the J-term 2015.\u00a0Developed by Irshad Manji , this seminar-style course is driven by Socratic questioning. It emphasizes reflection, interaction and unconventional ways of learning. Be prepared for inspiration and the hard work of using\u00a0it for your purpose.   To learn more, please contact \u00a0 irshad.manji@nyu.edu   Key themes:   Moral Courage   What exactly is moral courage? How has it been exhibited throughout history? Through the Moral Courage Channel on YouTube, we see it being exhibited today. Which raises the next question: Can anybody \u00a0develop moral courage? Finally, why is moral courage a pre-condition of cultivating purpose?   Identity\u00a0   Knowing your identity is a good thing. Or is it? Surprisingly, identity can be a major obstacle to developing\u00a0moral courage and achieving wholeness - or integrity.\u00a0What is the difference between identity and integrity? To grow from identity into integrity, what questions do we\u00a0need to ask ourselves?   Integrity   What does it mean to \"have integrity\"?\u00a0How do we\u00a0know when we\u00a0have it? Why does integrity matter for personal and professional advancement?   Turning Identity Into Integrity   Many successful people have transformed their identity into integrity. As a result, they have served a greater good. What can such people teach us?\u00a0We examine the stories\u00a0of Robert F. Kennedy on the one hand and Oprah Winfrey on the other.   Impact   Gandhi famously said, \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world.\u201d How does self-transformation translate into social impact?\u00a0   The Three I\u2019s Start Within You   Identity, integrity and impact are the three i\u2019s of cultivating purpose. How do these dots connect in your life? Where on this journey will you need moral courage to move forward? What are concrete\u00a0ways in which you can\u00a0sustain your\u00a0moral courage?

Indeed, the mere act of assigning people to groups is sufficient to evoke identification with fellow ingroup members and discrimination that favors ingroup over outgroup members. This intergroup discrimination occurs in the absence of any factors typically posited to account for intergroup bias, such as stereotypes, prior contact with group members or competition over resources (Tajfel, 1970). Moreover, when a given social identity is salient, people are more likely to perceive themselves and others as interchangeable exemplars of a social category rather than unique individuals. Our research explores how this process of self-categorization colors social perceptions and evaluations of the self and others in line with the values and contents associated with the current social identity (Turner, Oakes, Haslam, &amp; McGarty, 1994).   Our latest research explores the effects of self-categorization and social identity on cognition \u2014 from low-level perception and evaluation to social memory \u2013 across multiple levels-of-analysis. For example, we have assigned participants to a mixed-race team to test whether social perception and evaluation reflect the current relevant social identity even when other social categories are visually and socially salient. This research has shown that although racial biases are normally automatically activated, this process is not inevitable, and people can flexibly (and automatically) categorize and evaluate others according to other social dimensions, including the most minimal of social identities. We are currently extending this work to explore the effects of social identity on attention, perception, memory, consciousness, awareness and behavior, and trying to identify the neural mediators of these processes. We believe these studies will not only extend our understanding of social identity but may change our understanding of the social brain.   Social Categories and Psychophysiology   There is extensive evidence of racial disparities in health, including evidence that African Americans suffer from cardiovascular problems relative to Caucasian Americans. Although this issue has largely been considered from a medical perspective, my collaborators and I are interested in exploring whether social factors such as the perception of threat inherent in interracial contexts may play a role in producing these disparities. We are especially interested in the role of social identity in generating these disparities, and whether changing cognitions can reduce perceived threat and therefore attenuate racial disparities in cardiovascular responses.   MORAL COGNITION   The causes and consequences of moral construal   Models of moral decision-making generally propose a multistage process: the first involves determining that a situation is morally-relevant and that it should be evaluated in moral terms ( moral construal ); the second involves the application of moral decision-rules or reasoned principles to the situation in order to determine the morally right or wrong course of action ( moral judgment ). Most psychological research on morality has examined the second of these steps, confronting na\u00efve participants with moral dilemmas, and on the basis of their reactions making inferences about the nature of the decision-rules and reasoning processes that are applied to situations deemed morally relevant. However, if moral construal and judgment are separable, a particular behavior or course of action may be evaluated in both moral and non-moral terms. This is important, in part, because it helps to account for a particular type of moral failure, in which people make immoral decisions not because they intend to do so, but because they fail to recognize the moral implications of a course of action. Hannah Arendt famously described the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann as embodying the \u2018banality of evil\u2019, meaning that Eichmann had given no consideration to the moral implications of his actions, and had participated in the killing of many thousands of Jews for purely pragmatic reasons.\u00a0My collaborators and I are currently examining the flexibility of moral construal. Initial studies indicate that people can process and evaluate a host of issues according to moral standards and that moral processes may lead to systematic biases in decision-making and behavior, including extremism.   The psychology of hate   Throughout human history, the most heinous and heroic acts have been committed in the service of morality. It is therefore unsurprising that philosophers and scientists have long argued that hate stems from moral values (Aristotle, 350 BCE). Despite the immense theoretical and real-world significance of hate, there have been very few studies on the psychological underpinnings of hate, and none to determine whether hate differs from basic negative attitudes (i.e., dislike). To address this paucity of research, my collaborators and I have been conducting a series of studies to determine whether hate is quantitatively and/or qualitatively different from dislike. Our initial research indicates that hated people, objects and issues are not only more negative, but they are also more strongly associated with moral beliefs and emotions (e.g., contempt) and less strongly associated with empathy than disliked targets. Our initial research also suggests that hate motivates individuals to act destructively in the service of their moral beliefs or ideology. We are currently exploring whether hate is associated with destructive approach-related motivations whereas dislike is associated with avoidance-related motivations.   SCIENTIFIC APPROACH   \u201cIf social scientists choose to select rigorous theory as their ultimate goal, as have the natural scientists, they will succeed to the extent they traverse broad stretches of time and space. That means nothing less than aligning their explanations with those of the natural sciences.\u201d \u2013 E. O.

In 2011 I moved to the NYU-Stern School of Business, where I am a professor in the Business and Society Program . Stern has offered me the opportunity to test and apply my research on moral psychology. I'm working with economists and other social scientists to figure out how to make businesses, non-profits, cities, and other systems work more efficiently and ethically by doing ethical systems design         I study    morality and emotion, and how they vary across cultures. I am also active in positive psychology (the    scientific study of human flourishing) and study positive emotions such as moral elevation , admiration, and awe. My research in recent years focused on the moral foundations of politics, and on ways to transcend the   &#8220;culture wars&#8221; by using recent discoveries in moral psychology to foster more civil forms of politics . Morality, by its very nature, makes it hard to study morality. It binds people together into teams that seek victory, not truth. It closes hearts and minds to opponents even as it makes cooperation and decency possible within groups.        To live virtuously as individuals and as societies, we must understand how our minds are built (see ch. 1 of The Happiness Hypothesis, and Part I of The Righteous Mind ). We must find ways to overcome our natural self-righteousness (see ch. 4 of HH, or part II of RM). We must respect and even learn from those whose morality differs from our own (see this talk on politics, or this essay on religion).
