But this process of innovation is never complete, and new challenges await the electrical engineers of tomorrow.   As a student in our BS in Electrical Engineering program, you train to become a member of this next generation. Our curriculum builds on foundational mathematics and science courses with studies of analysis and design in electrical engineering. These studies often include hands-on coursework in our state-of-the-art laboratories. In addition, the variety of specialized subjects you can investigate through elective coursework &mdash; from local area networks to wireless communication and deregulated power systems &mdash; ensures a highly flexible education suited to your particular interests. Our BS in Electrical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET ( www.abet.org ).   Recognizing the need for well-rounded engineers, we also emphasize strong communication and interpersonal skills. Our students develop these skills not only through required courses in the humanities and social sciences but also during team projects in design classes. Sponsored research and affiliate programs put you in a position to learn from faculty familiar with current issues.   Where possible, classroom work will challenge you to apply your knowledge to current design situations. You&rsquo;ll also apply broad technical knowledge to practical problems through interdepartmental cooperation.   You can apply your electrical engineering training across a wide spectrum of fields. Our students have launched careers in electronic design, bioengineering, city planning, and astronautics. They also find opportunities in image processing, telemetry, computer design, and patent law. As they mature and develop their capabilities, their careers may move toward system engineering, management, sales, or education. Some graduates also pursue advanced studies toward a master&rsquo;s or doctorate degree.   Program Educational Objectives   The broad objectives of the Electrical Engineering Program are:      Graduates are expected to be engaged and advancing in their professional careers in a profession that utilizes their NYU Polytechnic degree, in Electrical Engineering or other career path, that include industry, academia, and governmental or non-governmental organizations.    Graduates are expected to be seeking continuous professional development and life-long learning through graduate school studies, continuing education credits and/or professional registration.&emsp;     Student Outcomes   In order to prepare our students to meet these objectives after graduation the ECE department has adopted the ABET a-k criteria as the appropriate student outcomes that our curriculum is designed to foster in our students:   (a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering   (b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data   (c) an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability   (d) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams   (e) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems   (f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility   (g) an ability to communicate effectively   (h) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context   (i) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning   (j) a knowledge of contemporary issues   (k) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice   Dual Majors   With departmental permission, you may earn a single bachelor&rsquo;s degree in electrical and computer engineering. This degree requires 142 credits rather than the usual 128 required for individual bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.   Minor in Electrical Engineering   You may obtain a minor in electrical engineering by taking 15 credits of EE prefixed courses. The courses may be any EE courses subject only to the prerequisite requirements. A grade of C- or better is required in EE 2013 and EE2024 and a GPA of 2.0 or better in the entire minor is required. A minimum of 8 credits in the minor must be taken at the School of Engineering. The electrical engineering minor is not open to computer engineering students.   Transfer Students   Transfer credits for courses taken at other schools are based on evaluation of content and level. Students completing the same program at another school, but in different years, may receive a different number of transfer credits. You should consult an electrical engineering undergraduate adviser for current information.

In fact, all electronics devices receive the attention, the design, and the creative input of electrical engineers.   As a student in the MS in Electrical Engineering program, you&rsquo;ll use what you&rsquo;ve already learned about physics, chemistry, and mathematics create the products of tomorrow. We support this kind of initiative by providing top-flight laboratories &mdash; home to developments in microwaves, VLSI design, and robotics &mdash; as well as a faculty dedicated to advanced research.   The program will prepare you for a professional career as an entrepreneur, a practicing engineer in industry, business or government at an advanced level, or to pursue a PhD degree in electrical engineering. You can choose a concentration from a number of stimulating fields, including the following:      Communications, Networking and Signal Processing    Computer Engineering and VLSI    Energy systems and power electronics    Electromagnetics and analog/RF/Biomedical circuits    Systems, control, and robotics        This program is also offered online .
