Organizations like GiveDirectly transfer money to poor clients living halfway around the world, who are then free to use the money as they please.      While GiveDirectly is the only NGO set up for the sole purpose of distributing unconditional cash transfers, cash transfers are quickly becoming a popular development intervention. DFID estimates that 1 billion people in emerging markets receive them each year. For example, economist Jenny Aker has studied the use of cash transfers in disasters, including the differences between handing out vouchers, physical cash, and sending money via cellphones.      Join the founders of GiveDirectly, Jenny Aker, and Timothy Ogden of FAI for a discussion about what this trend means for those living in poverty, for microfinance, and for the development industry as we know it. The discussion will be followed by a networking reception.

In the book, Ashe tells of his efforts to translate his studies in Nepal, India, and Zimbabwe into Saving for Change at Oxfam America, a program that has trained 35,000 savings groups in 8,000 villages.      Half the world is unbanked and need better ways to save and borrow. But even many people with access to traditional financial services struggle to save or receive loans on reasonable terms. Ashe contends that even the most innovative banking institutions can&#39;t reach them, but savings groups can. Savings groups have developed organically in many cultures around the world. While there are many different varieties of savings groups, several studies have found that the basic mechanisms of social support, regularity, and commitment that groups share are effective at helping poor households save. According to Ashe, savings groups are a robust, simple, low cost, self-replicating innovation that can meet the saving and borrowing needs of poor households around the world.      Jeffrey Ashe is a microfinance pioneer who has managed, designed and evaluated micro-finance programs in more than thirty countries including Working Capital in the United States which was awarded the first Presidential Award for Excellence in Microfinanceby President Clinton. He is an Adjunct Associate Professor at SIPA and teaches at the Sustainable International Development program the Heller School at Brandeis University.      Copies of In Their Own Hands will be available for purchase at the event.

Mr. Islam played a critical role in establishing BRAC as one of the largest microfinance institutions in Uganda in just three years. In New York for only a week, Mr. Islam has graciously offered to give the Wagner community a unique perspective into the evolution of BRAC Uganda.   Please join us for an engaging discussion and reception following the presentation.      Mr. Arif Islam is the Country Head of BRAC Uganda. Mr. Islam has played an instrumental role in launching BRAC Uganda in November 2005, and growing it to become one of the largest microfinance institutions in the country, in that time. BRAC Uganda has disbursed $35 million in loans to more than 90,000 borrowers through its network of 85 branch offices. It has also scaled up health, agriculture, adolescent development and education programs. Under Mr. Islam's visionary leadership, BRAC has emerged as the largest non-profit in the country, employing more than 1,500 people and touching the lives of more than half a million poor people in Uganda.      Mr. Islam joined BRAC in 1983 as a Program Organizer, and has since served as Regional Manager, Zonal Manager, and Program Manager of BRAC&rsquo;s education program in both Bangladesh and Afghanistan. He holds a Masters in Education and Development from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.      About BRAC Uganda:   In June 2006, BRAC began operating its Microfinance Program in two districts in Uganda - Kampala and Iganga. Since then, the program has successfully formed 2,352 groups, mobilized 63,407 poor women as members, and disbursed US$16.1 million in microloans to 43,967 members. Microloans are invested primarily in small-scale business, agriculture, and construction. Additionally, the BRAC Uganda primary education program has established 58 learning centers, trained 50 teachers, and graduated 844 children. Currently 1,891 children are enrolled in the program.
