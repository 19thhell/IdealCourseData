Vast changes in technologies and geopolitics have produced a wholesale shift in the way states and other powerful entities think about the production and retention of popular loyalties. Strategic communication has embraced these changes as stakes increase and the techniques of information management become more pervasive. These shifts in strategic communications impact free speech as major players, in a global context, rhetorically embrace a world of transparency, all the while increasing surveillance and modes of control, turning altered media technologies and traditional media doctrines to their advantage.   Building on examples drawn from the Arab Spring, the shaping of the Internet in China, Iran&#39;s perception of foreign broadcasting, and Russia&#39;s media interventions, this book exposes the anxieties of loss of control, on the one hand, and the missed opportunities for greater freedom, on the other. &ldquo;New&rdquo; strategic communication arises from the vast torrents of information that cross borders and uproot old forms of regulation. Not only states but also corporations, nongovernmental organizations, religious institutions, and others have become part of this new constellation of speakers and audiences.   Featuring Monroe Price ( @TheMonroePrice ), author, renowned communications expert, former Dean of Cardozo Law School, and Director of the Center for Global Communication Studies (CGCS) at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania.   Panelists include Rodney Benson ( @RodneyBensonNYU ), Associate Professor, NYU Steinhardt Department of Media, Culture, and Communication and Agnes Callamard ( @AgnesCallamard ), Director, Global Freedom of Expression &amp; Information, Columbia University.   Moderated by Stefaan Verhulst ( @TheGovLab ), Co-Founder and Chief Research and Development Officer, The Governance Lab at NYU.   Book signing and reception to follow the panel discussion.

Strategic communication has embraced these changes as stakes increase and the techniques of information management become more pervasive. These shifts in strategic communications impact free speech as major players, in a global context, rhetorically embrace a world of transparency, all the while increasing surveillance and modes of control, turning altered media technologies and traditional media doctrines to their advantage.   Building on examples drawn from the Arab Spring, the shaping of the Internet in China, Iran&#39;s perception of foreign broadcasting, and Russia&#39;s media interventions, this book exposes the anxieties of loss of control, on the one hand, and the missed opportunities for greater freedom, on the other. &ldquo;New&rdquo; strategic communication arises from the vast torrents of information that cross borders and uproot old forms of regulation. Not only states but also corporations, nongovernmental organizations, religious institutions, and others have become part of this new constellation of speakers and audiences.   Featuring Monroe Price ( @TheMonroePrice ), author, renowned communications expert, former Dean of Cardozo Law School, and Director of the Center for Global Communication Studies (CGCS) at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania.

The center produces a variety of research outputs tailored to its various audiences: teaching content for educators, practitioner-oriented publications for business executives and policymakers, as well as academic publications for the research community. Interdisciplinary approaches and engagement with practitioners are emphasized as sources of novel insights that help address real world challenges.    Specific projects that CGEM and the faculty involved with it are already engaged in include the preparation of the DHL Global Connectedness Index, a partnership with the Center on Global Enterprise on researching how to scale and speed up the globalization of business, and the development of digitized materials for educating students about globalization.
