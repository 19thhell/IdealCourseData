Under the influence of the \"new social history\" and \"history from below\" movements of the 1960s and 1970s, I did my doctoral dissertation on the emergence and evolution of a working class and labor movement in Egypt from the late nineteenth century until the Second World War; it was published in 1987 in a book co-authored with Joel Beinin. Since then I have sporadically continued to work on Egypt, with a special interest in society, culture and politics in the 1882-1919 period. I have also done a great deal of research on Palestine, manifested (among other things) in a 1989 edited volume on the Intifada and a 1996 book on relations between Arab and Jewish workers and labor movements in Palestine during the British mandate period, and various articles and papers. My most recent book is an introduction to the history and politics of Orientalism and Middle East studies, with particular attention to the study of the Middle East in the United States since 1945 and its intersections with U.S. policy in that region.

We cooperate closely with   the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, which offers a separate   program of study leading to the Ph.D. degree.         Our program focuses on the contemporary political economy and   cultures of the region and the historical processes that have shaped the   present. Courses cover modern history and politics, as well as   specialized topics that reflect areas of faculty research. These areas   currently include: questions of economic and political rights, law   and society, gender politics, Arabic fiction writing, Iranian literary   culture, the anthropology of Arab cities, Ottoman and Arab state   formation, Egyptian social history, and modern Iran and Central Asia.   Courses are also available on pre-modern Islamic history, literature,   and philosophy, and on the ancient Near East.         We pay special attention to language training, with   state-of-the-art instruction in Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and Turkish,   as well as Hindi/Urdu and ancient Near Eastern languages. Many   students also take intensive summer language programs in the U.S. or   abroad.        Our M.A. program is designed for     Those thinking of entering a Ph.D. program but wanting first   to explore different disciplines or advance their knowledge of the   region and its languages  Those planning a career in fields such as journalism, public   service, cultural organizations, human rights, or political advocacy   and seeking to understand the region's politics and history and to   engage with questions of culture, social transformation, and economic   justice.               MASTER OF ARTS IN NEAR EASTERN STUDIES     The MA program in Near Eastern Studies has three elements:      A coherent sequence of courses on the region, totaling 40 credit points A demonstrated ability in one modern language of the area A master's thesis or report written under the supervision of an adviser          The program includes an optional internship course. The degree    is normally completed within two years (four semesters) of full-time   study. Course of Study:         The 40 points of course work allow a flexible program, with just two required courses and a distribution requirement:          The required courses are the   core course: Problems and Methods in Middle Eastern Studies (G77.1687)   and History of the Islamic Middle East 1750 to the Present (G77.1642)   (or, with the approval of the director, an advanced history seminar).    Students select the remaining eight courses according to their   individual research interests, in consultation with the director.  The distribution requirement stipulates that these include   at least one course each from two of the following disciplines:   Anthropology, Economics, Politics, and Sociology. For example, two of   the following courses: Anthropology for Middle East Studies   (G14.1322); Economics of the Middle East (G31.1608); Middle East   Government and Politics (G53.2590); and Sociology of Islam (G77.1612).          Language Requirement:     To complete the degree, you must demonstrate proficiency at   the upper-intermediate level in Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, or Turkish.   (Other languages may be considered as meeting this requirement with   approval of the director of the program.) Those with no language   background can satisfy the requirement by completing four semesters   (16 credit points) of language training at NYU; however, only two of   those semesters (8 undergraduate language credits) can be counted as   points towards the degree. Students who have prior language training   or who take an intensive language course in the summer of their first   year can meet the requirement by testing at an intermediate level of   proficiency, or by enrolling in and completing an advanced class. Native   speakers with fluency in reading, writing, listening, and speaking   may waive this requirement with the permission of the director.      Master's Thesis or Report: The master's thesis should generally have the format, style,   and length of a substantial article in a scholarly journal.   Alternatively, with the approval of your thesis advisor, it could have   the format and style of a substantial professional report, of the   kind that might be commissioned by an NGO or international   organization. In either case, it must present your own research and   analysis and relate them to existing scholarly and/or professional   understandings of the topic.     You should begin thinking about possible topics for your   thesis during your first year in the master's program. We encourage   you to take courses offered by faculty who may be able to work with   you on your thesis or who may be able to suggest research areas or   topics. When you meet with the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS)   toward the end of the spring term of your first year to discuss fall   courses, you should discuss possible thesis ideas. You should try to   use the summer between your first and second years in the program to   develop your thesis topic and, if possible, conduct preliminary   research.      In the fall semester of your second year you must define your   thesis topic and, in consultation with the DGS, select a faculty   thesis advisor as well as a second reader. As early in the semester as   possible you should develop, in consultation with your thesis   advisor, a brief proposal discussing your research project, how it   relates to the existing literature on the topic, and the sources or   materials you plan to work with, including a bibliography. When your   proposal is approved by your advisor \u2013 in any case no later than the   end of the fall semester \u2013 you must submit to the DGS a copy of your   proposal as well as a thesis proposal approval form to be signed by   your advisor and your second reader; this form will also serve as   confirmation that your advisor and second reader are willing to work   with you on your thesis.      Students who are in the journalism, museum studies or   business programs must follow the procedures and deadlines outlined   above regarding consultation with the DGS, development of a thesis   topic, selection of an advisor and a second reader, and submission of   the approval form. Students in the journalism and museum studies   programs must adhere to the requirements of the Journalism Department   and the Program in Museum Studies, respectively, regarding the   master's project and master's essay. Journalism master's projects   should be read and approved by two faculty members, one of whom should   be affiliated with NES and the other with Journalism. The Museum   Studies master's essay should be read and approved by an   NES-affiliated faculty member; the other advisor/reader should be   affiliated with the Museum Studies program.

Members of the department are drawn from different disciplines (including anthropology, history, Islamic studies, language instruction, literature, and the study of religion) and are committed to providing students with a solid disciplinary grounding; at the same time, the department fosters interdisciplinary and comparative approaches to the study of the Middle East and the Muslim world.    Subject to approval by the DGS and their advisor(s), students may opt for one of several available \u201ctracks\u201d of course work and supervised research leading to the doctorate in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. Each of these tracks may have its own specific requirements, in addition to or instead of the basic requirements for the doctorate; see below for details. At present the tracks offered by MEIS include: culture and representation; Arabic literature; and Islamic studies. The fields of research are not limited to these tracks as long as there is a faculty member who supports your research interests within the department.
