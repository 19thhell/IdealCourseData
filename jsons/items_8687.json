Hide biography.      Sandra Shapshay is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University. Her interests center on 19 th century German philosophy, especially Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary aesthetics and ethics. Recently she has been working on reconstructing facets of Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic theory especially his theories of the sublime and tragedy in papers that have appeared in the Kantian Review, the British Journal of Aesthetics , and J. Levinson, ed. Suffering Art Gladly. She has also investigated Schopenhauer\u2019s theory of freedom in a paper co-authored with Alex Neill and published in the International Yearbook of German Idealism . Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.
