Students in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) need to fulfill 4 semesters of language as part of their College Core Curriculum (CORE). They can also fulfill their requirement with several placement exams. In-person placement exams in Spanish and Portuguese will be available for CAS students during the summer and throughout the Fall and Spring semesters: http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.placementexams    Portuguese         Spanish speakers with no formal training of Portuguese can  register directly for PORT UA 11 Portuguese for Spanish  Speakers.      Other students with no training in Portuguese can  register for PORT UA 1 Elementary Portuguese I or PORT UA 10  Intensive Elementary Portuguese.      Students with previous formal training and/or familiarity in Portuguese must  go to the College of Arts and Science\u2019s language exam website and take the  online exam, picking Portuguese among the choices: http://www.nyu.edu/cas/flpexam/ . Students will  receive a score placing them in a certain level and must register for that  level.      Students who score above the cutoff can take a written  in-person exam for exemption from the CORE requirement. They must sign up in  advance for the exemption exam. Information on dates and signing up can be  found at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams .  If they wish to continue their study of the language at NYU they must consult  directly with the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu .            Spanish    Students with no previous study of Spanish enroll in SPAN-UA 1 Spanish for Beginners I. Students with 1 year of High School Spanish may enroll in SPAN-UA 1 Spanish for Beginners I or take a placement test to determine placement. All other students must show proof of placement through the SAT II Placement Test (taken either before entering NYU or offered by CAS), the IB exam or the AP Test. If a student does not have any form of placement test available and has taken Spanish before, he/she needs to take the WebCAPE online placement exam (link provided at the end of this page). Students who have not taken a placement test and have taken Spanish before will not be allowed to stay in a course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Students with college Spanish from institutions other than NYU also need to take a placement test. Spanish Speakers : If you are a Spanish (heritage) speaker, you must a take a test in the department (not the online placement exam) for appropriate placement into SPAN-UA 11 (Spanish for Spanish Speakers) or SPAN-UA 111 (Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speakers). Completion of either of these courses will fulfill the language requirement for heritage speakers. Please call 212-998-8770 for more information, or write the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu , or the Coordinator of the Heritage Speakers course for further instructions.  I. SAT II Placement Test    The SAT II Placement Test can be used both for placement and to fulfill the CORE requirement. Please see the box below for placement and CORE requirement equivalencies.

AP Exams    Students can use the AP exams both for placement and to fulfill the CORE requirement. Please see the box below for placement and CORE requirement equivalencies. Students with the appropriate score in the AP exam will receive 4 university credits, in agreement with CAS and Department of Spanish and Portuguese standards.

They receive 4 credits of intermediate university language. They can enroll in SPAN-UA 100 (Advanced Grammar and Composition). This course is a prerequisite for all advanced-level courses in Spanish.                        AP4 Literature            Students receive 4 credits for SPAN-UA 100 and satisfy the College\u2019s language requirement. However, they need to take a language placement and speak with the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu if they wish to continue taking classes in Spanish.                          AP5 Literature            Students receive 4 credits for SPAN-UA 100 or, with approval of the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu , for SPAN-UA 200, and satisfy the College\u2019s language requirement. They need to talk to the Director of the Language Program for proper placement into a course if they wish to continue taking classes in the Department.                      AP3 and under                Students need to take the online placement test or show proof of SAT II or IB Spanish score.                III. IB Tests    Students can use the IB exams both for placement and to fulfill the CORE requirement. Please see the box below for placement and CORE requirement equivalencies.                IB Score          PLACES STUDENT IN                  IB6 or IB7            Scores of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate Higher Level examination are accepted as evidence of intermediate-level accomplishment and exemption from the language requirement.                    IB5 and under              Needs to take placement test or show proof of SAT II or AP Spanish score.                    IV. WebCAPE Online Exam    Students who do not have an SAT II, an AP or an IB placement exam, can take the WebCAPE online exam (see link below) before they can register into a language class. The same is true if they have taken university level Spanish not from an NYU-site. Please note that this exam may not be used to fulfill the CORE requirement; it is only used for placement purposes. The WebCAPE online placement exam in Spanish consists of a series of multiple-choice format questions on vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. Since it is an adaptive test, the length varies from one individual to another, with an average time of 20 minutes. At the exam welcome screen students must provide their name, last name, NYU email and N number. The score and placement recommendation will be notified to the student and to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese immediately upon completion of the exam. Students must print their scores and bring them to class on the first week of classes.    Please be aware that the exam must represent each student\u2019s own work. Students are bound by New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Science Code of Academic Integrity ( http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity ), and must abstain from activities constitutive of fraud. To take the NYU online placement exam please go to:  http://webcape.byuhtrsc.org/?acct=nyu [Password: nyulanguage ].
