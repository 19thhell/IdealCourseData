In addition to \u201cStrength\u201d and \u201cIntelligence,\u201d Hamlet has variable character traits like \u201cSanity\u201d and \u201cProcrastination,\u201d which can be adjusted to levels from 1 to 10.  Traditional RPGs take a long time to play, and Hamlet adaptations can run several hours, so to save time the Hamlet Simulator has only one button: Start. The Simulator then feeds out a series of brief plot points and finally tells the player who lived and who died at the end of the play, complete with a death percentage of overall cast. This summarized take on Hamlet is influenced heavily by the play The Compleat Wrks of Wllm Shkspr (Abridged).  Taking just minutes to play, this fast game presents several original endings to the play, in the style of a Choose Your Own Adventure book. The final product will be made available on the web to bored high school students everywhere."}]}]
