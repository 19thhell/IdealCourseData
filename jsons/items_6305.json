Yet despite the inherent vulnerability that comes with having one's work criticized, it is possible to constructively engage with and learn from criticism. This proseminar is designed for students interested in the visual, literary or performing arts. It is primarily intended for practicing artist/scholars who wish to explore how criticism may productively influence their creative process as well as understand their artwork and the role of criticism in a broader historical and theoretical context. In this class we will survey a range of readings that reveal issues about the history and changing purposes of criticism. Central to our exploration, however, is the requirement that each student create a piece of art (a screenplay, musical composition, painting, theatre performance, or other medium determined by the student\u2019s concentration), which will receive criticism at various stages of development from a wide hierarchy of sources: peer, faculty, critics and experts in the field. Over the course of the semester, students will further develop their artwork in response to critique, while concurrently writing critically about their own work and work of their classmates. This iterative process of creation and criticism will provide an opportunity to deeply examine, through both theory and practice, the intersections between artist, audience, scholar and critic.

He is theatre generalist with expertise in direction, acting, theatre history and costume design, but is interested in holistic approaches to theatre-making that transcend the boundaries of traditional disciplines. He has directed numerous productions at venues around New York including NYU, Theater for the New City, the cell and the Culture Project. He has performed at the Kennedy Center, the Saratoga Shakespeare Company and Off-Broadway at the Mint Theater. His costume designs have been seen at the Juilliard School, the Wheeler Opera House and the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey. Matthew also worked as a costume artisan on various films including \u201cX-Men\u201d, \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\u201d, and \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d. He has been on the faculty at Adelphi University, SUNY Albany, Siena College and CUNY - Kingsborough. Currently, in addition to his work at Gallatin, Matthew serves as the Artistic Director of the Hive and also teaches at the Lee Strasberg Theatre &amp; Film Institute.

Yet despite the inherent vulnerability that comes with having one's work criticized, it is possible to constructively engage with and learn from criticism. This proseminar is designed for students interested in the visual, literary or performing arts. It is primarily intended for practicing artist/scholars who wish to explore how criticism may productively influence their creative process as well as understand their artwork and the role of criticism in a broader historical and theoretical context. In this class we will survey a range of readings that reveal issues about the history and changing purposes of criticism. Central to our exploration, however, is the requirement that each student create a piece of art (a screenplay, musical composition, painting, theatre performance, or other medium determined by the student\u2019s concentration), which will receive criticism at various stages of development from a wide hierarchy of sources: peer, faculty, critics and experts in the field. Over the course of the semester, students will further develop their artwork in response to critique, while concurrently writing critically about their own work and work of their classmates. This iterative process of creation and criticism will provide an opportunity to deeply examine, through both theory and practice, the intersections between artist, audience, scholar and critic.
