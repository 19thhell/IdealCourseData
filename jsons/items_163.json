It conducted original research to influence and shape local, state and national policies that affect women of color, their families and communities and offered leadership development for women of color.

This shift reflects our recognition of the critical need to applaud, support and accelerate the work of leaders of color conducting research, advocating for more just and equitable policies, and providing services to communities that might otherwise be underserved.   The People of Color Leadership Network aims to play an important role in connecting people of color to exchange best practices and support each other, in strengthening their development as leaders and managers at all levels within organizations, in promoting their engagement in relevant diverse networks where they can collaborate around common visions, and in expanding the impact they have individually and collectively within organizations, systems and on a global scale on issues of public importance.   \u00a0   \u00a0\u00a0                                                                                             NYU.edu   \u00a9 NYU Wagner\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0212.998.7400\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Copyright and Fair Use \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Contact Us"}]},

Research generated at the Network is used to create informed public policies at local, state and national levels.   Established in 2000 with core support from Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields and the Ford Foundation, the Women of Color Policy Network is the only research and policy institute in the country focused on women of color housed at a top ranked public policy school.   The impetus for the creation of the Network came out of a conference convened by the Roundtable of Institutions of People of Color held at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service entitled Women of Color: The Forgotten Members of the New Economy.   At the conference, participants were dismayed by the lack of available data and research on women of color. Without relevant data or research, the group concluded that there would always be a gap in public policies created at the local, state, and national levels and the real needs of women and communities of color.   Participants also stressed the need for an analytic and methodological framework that would take into consideration the impact of race, class, gender, ethnicity and other markers of difference on policy analysis and formation. The late Dr. Walter Stafford, professor of Urban Planning and Policy at NYU Wagner, served as the Institute's Principal Investigator from its inception until September 2008. In 2008, the Network became an affiliate of the Research Center for Leadership in Action.
