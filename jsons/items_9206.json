From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics includes some 50 outstanding ancient Mesopotamian objects and more than 100 illuminating documents, photographs, and drawings, with a focus on excavations from the 1920s and 30s, when many important finds were unearthed at sites in present-day Iraq. It reveals the role of archaeologists, art historians, journalists, museum curators, and conservators in constructing identities for ancient artifacts that not only resonated with Western popular and artistic culture, but that also positioned the finds as integral to the history of Western civilization.   In a first for ISAW, From Ancient to Modern includes ten works of modern and contemporary art, demonstrating the evolving influence that archaeological artifacts, and the way they were presented, had and continue to have on artists of our day.   The exhibition has been curated by Jennifer Chi, ISAW\u2019s Director of Exhibitions and Chief Curator, and Pedro Azara, Professor of Aesthetics and the Theory of Art at Polytechnic University of Catalonia. It will remain on view through June 7, 2015 .   Dr. Chi states, \u201c From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics proposes some provocative ideas about the way that archaeological artifacts have been presented to and perceived by the public. With ancient artifacts, related material, and a selection of modern and contemporary art, the exhibition creates an unprecedented and multi-layered view of some of the most famous sites in the history of archaeology, and, importantly, illustrates the ongoing life of ancient objects. ISAW is grateful to the Penn Museum for its extremely generous loans to the exhibition. We also owe many thanks to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago for its ongoing support, which included opening the doors to its rich permanent collection and archive.\u201d   From Ancient to Modern opens with a gallery devoted to a number of Mesopotamian archaeological sites. Concentrating on Ur, perhaps best known as the birthplace of the biblical figure of Abraham, and several sites in the Diyala River valley, the display includes many now iconic objects. These are shown alongside documentation that opens a window onto day-to-day life at the excavations while illustrating the ways in which the finds they uncovered were carefully described and presented to the press and public in order to garner maximum appeal. Select objects are followed as they are strategically presented to an international audience, effecting their transformation from archaeological item to aesthetic object.     U r  The most comprehensive archaeological exploration of Urbegan in 1922, with a team led by British archaeologist Charles Leonard Woolley. As seen in a number of photographs that illuminate life at the site, Woolley was a dashing figure, sometimes sporting a fedora, a tight jacket, and even dress shoes amid the dust and dirt of an active dig. His team of international archaeologists included one woman, the widow Katharine Keeling, whom he would marry. (Another archaeologist there, Max Mallowan, would later marry Agatha Christie, whom he met on the site. Christie\u2019s mystery Murder in Mesopotamia provides a rich picture of life at the dig.)   The most spectacular of Woolley\u2019s discoveries was the tomb of Queen Puabi, represented in the exhibition through exceptionally well preserved, 4,500-year-old artifacts on loan from the Penn Museum. The tomb contained a remarkably rich concentration of jewelry, found on and with the queen\u2019s body. Much of this was discovered as masses of gold and semi-precious beads, pendants, and other individual components with which the expedition team worked to re-create the original jewelry. The exhibition includes Puabi\u2019s richly beaded cloak and belt, re-created from extraordinary numbers of carnelian, lapis lazuli, and gold beads, and a dazzling headdress comprising lavish gold components that include a massive floral-shaped comb, fillets of pounded sheets of gold, and botanical wreaths.   An especially interesting example of the ways in which Woolley and his team re-created Puabi\u2019s jewels is the so-called Diadem of Puabi, which the excavation team assembled from a pile of thousands of lapis beads and gold pendants found in the tomb. In its original reconstruction, represented in the exhibition through photographs, the piece has striking similarities with headbands worn during the 1920s and 30s, including a contemporaneous example designed by Cartier, though Woolley indicates in his note cards that he was reconstructing it as he felt the archaeological evidence indicated. In fact, although the Woolleys\u2019 version of the headdress was aesthetically pleasing, more recent research by the Penn Museum indicates that it was not in fact a single ornament but most likely a series of beaded strands with pendants.   Presented to the public at an exhibition at the British Museum and via strategically cultivated, widespread media coverage, Puabi and her astounding dress assumed an aesthetic aura that radiated the apparent power of its original owner and ignited a frisson of identification with the onetime queen that helped gain visibility for the excavation at Ur. A selection of newspaper and magazine clippings document the overwhelming popular response to the reconstructed image, revealing that Queen Puabi soon became something of a fashion and lifestyle sensation, the subject of articles with such titles as \u201cAncient Queen Used Rouge and Lipstick.\u201d     Diyala River Valley  If the jewels from Ur largely existed for the public within the aesthetic of popular design and culture, the statuary found in the Diyala region, north of Ur, constituted the first early Mesopotamian artifacts to be studied and presented as works of art. Between 1930 and 1937, four expeditions on behalf of the Oriental Institute led by Henri Frankfort, a Dutch-born, London-educated archaeologist and historian of classical art, uncovered hundreds of Sumerian statues located in architectural contexts, many identified as temples. Dating from the mid-third millennium BCE, the statues included standing male and female figures with hands clasped in front, perhaps in worship, and seated cup-bearing males, all considered the paradigms of their types.   Archaeology and Aesthetics contains ten of these exquisite statuettes, representing both the  traditional types and variations within them. They are juxtaposed with articles, letters, field cards, notebooks, photographs, and other complementary material.    Viewed together, the archival material sheds light on the ways in which these artifacts were approached from an aesthetic perspective and placed within an art historical context. For example, Frankfort (who would become director of the Warburg Institute, in London) was among the first archaeologists to use the word \u201csculpture\u201d to describe ancient statuary, and his descriptions frequently used the vocabulary of art historical formalism. In articles, letters, and books, he stated that the creators of the figures had \u201cfollowed abstraction to its utmost limits,\u201d and repeatedly described the statues with such terms as \u201cform,\u201d \u201cmass,\u201d and \u201cspace\u201d\u2014all associated with the description of early- and mid-twentieth-century art. In the introduction to his well-known book More Sculpture from the Diyala Region , for example, he stated that the statuary was marked by \u201ca vigorous and inventive stylization with obvious traces of experiment.\u201d The focus on form was also used to link these Sumerian objects to so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d art, from which many contemporary artists had drawn inspiration, and to describe them as \u201cuniversal,\u201c a term often used in association with fine art and one that helped to position the statues as the origin point of Western art.   Like the written materials, the expedition\u2019s visual documentation of the sculptures was meticulous, scholarly, and focused on the aesthetic. Images of the objects drawn on field cards, for example, were carefully placed vis-\u00e0-vis the white space of the card, with brief descriptions positioned so as to balance the image. Similarly, many expedition photographs isolate a single statue against a dark backdrop, with no indication of the temple, palace, or tomb in which it was found, giving the image the timeless quality that imbues so much art photography.   The ramifications of Frankfort\u2019s aesthetic perspective can hardly be overstated. It had lasting impact not only on ongoing scholarship on material from Ur, but also on the entire discourse on the origins of Western art, as well as on modern artists who were inspired by the objects displayed in European and North American museums, where they were generally installed in vitrines, without visual or didactic reference to their contexts.   The Past as Present: Modern and Contemporary Art   From Ancient to Modern continues with a gallery devoted to twentieth-century artistic responses to ancient Mesopotamian objects. As the artifacts began to make their way into museums across pre-War Europe, Alberto Giacometti, Georges Bataille, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and others drew inspiration from Sumerian figures, while later in the United States, artists including Willem de Kooning, David Smith, and the poet Charles Olson saw in Sumerian objects and poems a kind of energy and vision they believed had been lost.   For Giacometti, who strove in his work to express the human condition, the Sumerian heads he saw at the Louvre represented a time when humans were integrally related to, rather than alienated from, both the visible and spiritual worlds. Archaeology and Aesthetics includes four drawings (both ca.1935) in which the artist explores the image of the Sumerian ruler Gudea, emphasizing the geometric planes and patterns in ancient sculptural portrayals of the king, an example of which is on view in this gallery.   Moore, too, was inspired by Sumerian sculptures, which he saw at the British Museum. Like Giacometti, he felt that they contained something essential about the human condition. Moore was especially fascinated by the relationship between the head and clasped hands, as seen in the statuary unearthed by Frankfort, finding there, as he put it, \u201ca wealth of meaning.\u201d The exhibition includes Moore\u2019s Seated Figure and Half Figure II (both 1929), each depicting, with simple, powerful forms, a female figure with clasped hands.   Later, the strongly frontal pose and staring, hypnotic eyes of de Kooning\u2019s iconic \u201cWoman\u201d series, represented here by two oil-on-paper works (1953\u201354 and 1967), also evoke Sumerian sculpture. Indeed, the artist, who saw artifacts from the Diyala Valley site of Tell Asmar at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, noted that the grins on the faces of his \u201cWoman\u201d paintings are \u201crather like the Mesopotamian idols.\u201d The examples here are shown next to an iconic Tell Asmar worshipper statue that de Kooning had surely seen at the Museum.   Reflecting contemporary viewpoints, many artists today return archaeological artifacts to their role as windows onto human history and cultures rather than as aesthetic objects. Archaeology and Aesthetics hig lights this with work by Jananne al-Ani, who was born in Kirkuk, Iraq, and lives and works in London, and the Chicago-based Michael Rakowitz, who is of Iraqi-Jewish heritage. Both al-Ani and Rakowitz create art expressive of the traumatic loss of human heritage caused by wars and spreading conflict in the Near- and Middle East.   Al-Ani\u2019s subtle and moving Untitled May 1991 [Gulf War Work] takes the form of a grid of photographs of subjects ranging from family members, to Sumerian artifacts, to news images of what has become known as \u201cthe first Gulf War.\u201d The work mixes individual with collective histories, evoking the loss of the artist\u2019s family history and cultural heritage while providing the personal perspective of inhabitants that is so often missing from media portrayals of war.   Rakowitz\u2019s powerful, eloquent installation The Invisible Enemy Should not Exist (Recovered, Missing, Stolen) (2003) comprises lifesized reproductions of Mesopotamian artifacts that are missing (or were in 2003) from the collection of the National Museum of Iraq, in Baghdad. The work varies in size depending on where it is installed; at ISAW it comprises 25 reproductions. With each object made of a mass-produced, readily available Iraqi product, such as cigarette cases and milk cartons, The Invisible Enemy draws a parallel between their cheap disposability and the treatment of the priceless evidence of human heritage that was looted or treated as waste after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

U r  The most comprehensive archaeological exploration of Urbegan in 1922, with a team led by British archaeologist Charles Leonard Woolley. As seen in a number of photographs that illuminate life at the site, Woolley was a dashing figure, sometimes sporting a fedora, a tight jacket, and even dress shoes amid the dust and dirt of an active dig. His team of international archaeologists included one woman, the widow Katharine Keeling, whom he would marry. (Another archaeologist there, Max Mallowan, would later marry Agatha Christie, whom he met on the site. Christie\u2019s mystery Murder in Mesopotamia provides a rich picture of life at the dig.)   The most spectacular of Woolley\u2019s discoveries was the tomb of Queen Puabi, represented in the exhibition through exceptionally well preserved, 4,500-year-old artifacts on loan from the Penn Museum. The tomb contained a remarkably rich concentration of jewelry, found on and with the queen\u2019s body. Much of this was discovered as masses of gold and semi-precious beads, pendants, and other individual components with which the expedition team worked to re-create the original jewelry. The exhibition includes Puabi\u2019s richly beaded cloak and belt, re-created from extraordinary numbers of carnelian, lapis lazuli, and gold beads, and a dazzling headdress comprising lavish gold components that include a massive floral-shaped comb, fillets of pounded sheets of gold, and botanical wreaths.   An especially interesting example of the ways in which Woolley and his team re-created Puabi\u2019s jewels is the so-called Diadem of Puabi, which the excavation team assembled from a pile of thousands of lapis beads and gold pendants found in the tomb. In its original reconstruction, represented in the exhibition through photographs, the piece has striking similarities with headbands worn during the 1920s and 30s, including a contemporaneous example designed by Cartier, though Woolley indicates in his note cards that he was reconstructing it as he felt the archaeological evidence indicated. In fact, although the Woolleys\u2019 version of the headdress was aesthetically pleasing, more recent research by the Penn Museum indicates that it was not in fact a single ornament but most likely a series of beaded strands with pendants.   Presented to the public at an exhibition at the British Museum and via strategically cultivated, widespread media coverage, Puabi and her astounding dress assumed an aesthetic aura that radiated the apparent power of its original owner and ignited a frisson of identification with the onetime queen that helped gain visibility for the excavation at Ur. A selection of newspaper and magazine clippings document the overwhelming popular response to the reconstructed image, revealing that Queen Puabi soon became something of a fashion and lifestyle sensation, the subject of articles with such titles as \u201cAncient Queen Used Rouge and Lipstick.\u201d     Diyala River Valley  If the jewels from Ur largely existed for the public within the aesthetic of popular design and culture, the statuary found in the Diyala region, north of Ur, constituted the first early Mesopotamian artifacts to be studied and presented as works of art. Between 1930 and 1937, four expeditions on behalf of the Oriental Institute led by Henri Frankfort, a Dutch-born, London-educated archaeologist and historian of classical art, uncovered hundreds of Sumerian statues located in architectural contexts, many identified as temples. Dating from the mid-third millennium BCE, the statues included standing male and female figures with hands clasped in front, perhaps in worship, and seated cup-bearing males, all considered the paradigms of their types.   Archaeology and Aesthetics contains ten of these exquisite statuettes, representing both the  traditional types and variations within them. They are juxtaposed with articles, letters, field cards, notebooks, photographs, and other complementary material.    Viewed together, the archival material sheds light on the ways in which these artifacts were approached from an aesthetic perspective and placed within an art historical context. For example, Frankfort (who would become director of the Warburg Institute, in London) was among the first archaeologists to use the word \u201csculpture\u201d to describe ancient statuary, and his descriptions frequently used the vocabulary of art historical formalism. In articles, letters, and books, he stated that the creators of the figures had \u201cfollowed abstraction to its utmost limits,\u201d and repeatedly described the statues with such terms as \u201cform,\u201d \u201cmass,\u201d and \u201cspace\u201d\u2014all associated with the description of early- and mid-twentieth-century art. In the introduction to his well-known book More Sculpture from the Diyala Region , for example, he stated that the statuary was marked by \u201ca vigorous and inventive stylization with obvious traces of experiment.\u201d The focus on form was also used to link these Sumerian objects to so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d art, from which many contemporary artists had drawn inspiration, and to describe them as \u201cuniversal,\u201c a term often used in association with fine art and one that helped to position the statues as the origin point of Western art.   Like the written materials, the expedition\u2019s visual documentation of the sculptures was meticulous, scholarly, and focused on the aesthetic. Images of the objects drawn on field cards, for example, were carefully placed vis-\u00e0-vis the white space of the card, with brief descriptions positioned so as to balance the image. Similarly, many expedition photographs isolate a single statue against a dark backdrop, with no indication of the temple, palace, or tomb in which it was found, giving the image the timeless quality that imbues so much art photography.   The ramifications of Frankfort\u2019s aesthetic perspective can hardly be overstated. It had lasting impact not only on ongoing scholarship on material from Ur, but also on the entire discourse on the origins of Western art, as well as on modern artists who were inspired by the objects displayed in European and North American museums, where they were generally installed in vitrines, without visual or didactic reference to their contexts.   The Past as Present: Modern and Contemporary Art   From Ancient to Modern continues with a gallery devoted to twentieth-century artistic responses to ancient Mesopotamian objects. As the artifacts began to make their way into museums across pre-War Europe, Alberto Giacometti, Georges Bataille, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and others drew inspiration from Sumerian figures, while later in the United States, artists including Willem de Kooning, David Smith, and the poet Charles Olson saw in Sumerian objects and poems a kind of energy and vision they believed had been lost.   For Giacometti, who strove in his work to express the human condition, the Sumerian heads he saw at the Louvre represented a time when humans were integrally related to, rather than alienated from, both the visible and spiritual worlds. Archaeology and Aesthetics includes four drawings (both ca.1935) in which the artist explores the image of the Sumerian ruler Gudea, emphasizing the geometric planes and patterns in ancient sculptural portrayals of the king, an example of which is on view in this gallery.   Moore, too, was inspired by Sumerian sculptures, which he saw at the British Museum. Like Giacometti, he felt that they contained something essential about the human condition. Moore was especially fascinated by the relationship between the head and clasped hands, as seen in the statuary unearthed by Frankfort, finding there, as he put it, \u201ca wealth of meaning.\u201d The exhibition includes Moore\u2019s Seated Figure and Half Figure II (both 1929), each depicting, with simple, powerful forms, a female figure with clasped hands.   Later, the strongly frontal pose and staring, hypnotic eyes of de Kooning\u2019s iconic \u201cWoman\u201d series, represented here by two oil-on-paper works (1953\u201354 and 1967), also evoke Sumerian sculpture. Indeed, the artist, who saw artifacts from the Diyala Valley site of Tell Asmar at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, noted that the grins on the faces of his \u201cWoman\u201d paintings are \u201crather like the Mesopotamian idols.\u201d The examples here are shown next to an iconic Tell Asmar worshipper statue that de Kooning had surely seen at the Museum.   Reflecting contemporary viewpoints, many artists today return archaeological artifacts to their role as windows onto human history and cultures rather than as aesthetic objects. Archaeology and Aesthetics hig lights this with work by Jananne al-Ani, who was born in Kirkuk, Iraq, and lives and works in London, and the Chicago-based Michael Rakowitz, who is of Iraqi-Jewish heritage. Both al-Ani and Rakowitz create art expressive of the traumatic loss of human heritage caused by wars and spreading conflict in the Near- and Middle East.   Al-Ani\u2019s subtle and moving Untitled May 1991 [Gulf War Work] takes the form of a grid of photographs of subjects ranging from family members, to Sumerian artifacts, to news images of what has become known as \u201cthe first Gulf War.\u201d The work mixes individual with collective histories, evoking the loss of the artist\u2019s family history and cultural heritage while providing the personal perspective of inhabitants that is so often missing from media portrayals of war.   Rakowitz\u2019s powerful, eloquent installation The Invisible Enemy Should not Exist (Recovered, Missing, Stolen) (2003) comprises lifesized reproductions of Mesopotamian artifacts that are missing (or were in 2003) from the collection of the National Museum of Iraq, in Baghdad. The work varies in size depending on where it is installed; at ISAW it comprises 25 reproductions. With each object made of a mass-produced, readily available Iraqi product, such as cigarette cases and milk cartons, The Invisible Enemy draws a parallel between their cheap disposability and the treatment of the priceless evidence of human heritage that was looted or treated as waste after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Hide biography.      Sandra Shapshay is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University. Her interests center on 19 th century German philosophy, especially Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary aesthetics and ethics. Recently she has been working on reconstructing facets of Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic theory especially his theories of the sublime and tragedy in papers that have appeared in the Kantian Review, the British Journal of Aesthetics , and J. Levinson, ed. Suffering Art Gladly. She has also investigated Schopenhauer\u2019s theory of freedom in a paper co-authored with Alex Neill and published in the International Yearbook of German Idealism . Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.

From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics includes some 50 outstanding ancient Mesopotamian objects and more than 100 illuminating documents, photographs, and drawings, with a focus on excavations from the 1920s and 30s, when many important finds were unearthed at sites in present-day Iraq. It reveals the role of archaeologists, art historians, journalists, museum curators, and conservators in constructing identities for ancient artifacts that not only resonated with Western popular and artistic culture, but that also positioned the finds as integral to the history of Western civilization.   In a first for ISAW, From Ancient to Modern includes ten works of modern and contemporary art, demonstrating the evolving influence that archaeological artifacts, and the way they were presented, had and continue to have on artists of our day.   The exhibition has been curated by Jennifer Chi, ISAW\u2019s Director of Exhibitions and Chief Curator, and Pedro Azara, Professor of Aesthetics and the Theory of Art at Polytechnic University of Catalonia. It will remain on view through June 7, 2015 .   Dr. Chi states, \u201c From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics proposes some provocative ideas about the way that archaeological artifacts have been presented to and perceived by the public. With ancient artifacts, related material, and a selection of modern and contemporary art, the exhibition creates an unprecedented and multi-layered view of some of the most famous sites in the history of archaeology, and, importantly, illustrates the ongoing life of ancient objects. ISAW is grateful to the Penn Museum for its extremely generous loans to the exhibition. We also owe many thanks to the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago for its ongoing support, which included opening the doors to its rich permanent collection and archive.\u201d   From Ancient to Modern opens with a gallery devoted to a number of Mesopotamian archaeological sites. Concentrating on Ur, perhaps best known as the birthplace of the biblical figure of Abraham, and several sites in the Diyala River valley, the display includes many now iconic objects. These are shown alongside documentation that opens a window onto day-to-day life at the excavations while illustrating the ways in which the finds they uncovered were carefully described and presented to the press and public in order to garner maximum appeal. Select objects are followed as they are strategically presented to an international audience, effecting their transformation from archaeological item to aesthetic object.     U r  The most comprehensive archaeological exploration of Urbegan in 1922, with a team led by British archaeologist Charles Leonard Woolley. As seen in a number of photographs that illuminate life at the site, Woolley was a dashing figure, sometimes sporting a fedora, a tight jacket, and even dress shoes amid the dust and dirt of an active dig. His team of international archaeologists included one woman, the widow Katharine Keeling, whom he would marry. (Another archaeologist there, Max Mallowan, would later marry Agatha Christie, whom he met on the site. Christie\u2019s mystery Murder in Mesopotamia provides a rich picture of life at the dig.)   The most spectacular of Woolley\u2019s discoveries was the tomb of Queen Puabi, represented in the exhibition through exceptionally well preserved, 4,500-year-old artifacts on loan from the Penn Museum. The tomb contained a remarkably rich concentration of jewelry, found on and with the queen\u2019s body. Much of this was discovered as masses of gold and semi-precious beads, pendants, and other individual components with which the expedition team worked to re-create the original jewelry. The exhibition includes Puabi\u2019s richly beaded cloak and belt, re-created from extraordinary numbers of carnelian, lapis lazuli, and gold beads, and a dazzling headdress comprising lavish gold components that include a massive floral-shaped comb, fillets of pounded sheets of gold, and botanical wreaths.   An especially interesting example of the ways in which Woolley and his team re-created Puabi\u2019s jewels is the so-called Diadem of Puabi, which the excavation team assembled from a pile of thousands of lapis beads and gold pendants found in the tomb. In its original reconstruction, represented in the exhibition through photographs, the piece has striking similarities with headbands worn during the 1920s and 30s, including a contemporaneous example designed by Cartier, though Woolley indicates in his note cards that he was reconstructing it as he felt the archaeological evidence indicated. In fact, although the Woolleys\u2019 version of the headdress was aesthetically pleasing, more recent research by the Penn Museum indicates that it was not in fact a single ornament but most likely a series of beaded strands with pendants.   Presented to the public at an exhibition at the British Museum and via strategically cultivated, widespread media coverage, Puabi and her astounding dress assumed an aesthetic aura that radiated the apparent power of its original owner and ignited a frisson of identification with the onetime queen that helped gain visibility for the excavation at Ur. A selection of newspaper and magazine clippings document the overwhelming popular response to the reconstructed image, revealing that Queen Puabi soon became something of a fashion and lifestyle sensation, the subject of articles with such titles as \u201cAncient Queen Used Rouge and Lipstick.\u201d     Diyala River Valley  If the jewels from Ur largely existed for the public within the aesthetic of popular design and culture, the statuary found in the Diyala region, north of Ur, constituted the first early Mesopotamian artifacts to be studied and presented as works of art. Between 1930 and 1937, four expeditions on behalf of the Oriental Institute led by Henri Frankfort, a Dutch-born, London-educated archaeologist and historian of classical art, uncovered hundreds of Sumerian statues located in architectural contexts, many identified as temples. Dating from the mid-third millennium BCE, the statues included standing male and female figures with hands clasped in front, perhaps in worship, and seated cup-bearing males, all considered the paradigms of their types.   Archaeology and Aesthetics contains ten of these exquisite statuettes, representing both the  traditional types and variations within them. They are juxtaposed with articles, letters, field cards, notebooks, photographs, and other complementary material.    Viewed together, the archival material sheds light on the ways in which these artifacts were approached from an aesthetic perspective and placed within an art historical context. For example, Frankfort (who would become director of the Warburg Institute, in London) was among the first archaeologists to use the word \u201csculpture\u201d to describe ancient statuary, and his descriptions frequently used the vocabulary of art historical formalism. In articles, letters, and books, he stated that the creators of the figures had \u201cfollowed abstraction to its utmost limits,\u201d and repeatedly described the statues with such terms as \u201cform,\u201d \u201cmass,\u201d and \u201cspace\u201d\u2014all associated with the description of early- and mid-twentieth-century art. In the introduction to his well-known book More Sculpture from the Diyala Region , for example, he stated that the statuary was marked by \u201ca vigorous and inventive stylization with obvious traces of experiment.\u201d The focus on form was also used to link these Sumerian objects to so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d art, from which many contemporary artists had drawn inspiration, and to describe them as \u201cuniversal,\u201c a term often used in association with fine art and one that helped to position the statues as the origin point of Western art.   Like the written materials, the expedition\u2019s visual documentation of the sculptures was meticulous, scholarly, and focused on the aesthetic. Images of the objects drawn on field cards, for example, were carefully placed vis-\u00e0-vis the white space of the card, with brief descriptions positioned so as to balance the image. Similarly, many expedition photographs isolate a single statue against a dark backdrop, with no indication of the temple, palace, or tomb in which it was found, giving the image the timeless quality that imbues so much art photography.   The ramifications of Frankfort\u2019s aesthetic perspective can hardly be overstated. It had lasting impact not only on ongoing scholarship on material from Ur, but also on the entire discourse on the origins of Western art, as well as on modern artists who were inspired by the objects displayed in European and North American museums, where they were generally installed in vitrines, without visual or didactic reference to their contexts.   The Past as Present: Modern and Contemporary Art   From Ancient to Modern continues with a gallery devoted to twentieth-century artistic responses to ancient Mesopotamian objects. As the artifacts began to make their way into museums across pre-War Europe, Alberto Giacometti, Georges Bataille, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, and others drew inspiration from Sumerian figures, while later in the United States, artists including Willem de Kooning, David Smith, and the poet Charles Olson saw in Sumerian objects and poems a kind of energy and vision they believed had been lost.   For Giacometti, who strove in his work to express the human condition, the Sumerian heads he saw at the Louvre represented a time when humans were integrally related to, rather than alienated from, both the visible and spiritual worlds. Archaeology and Aesthetics includes four drawings (both ca.1935) in which the artist explores the image of the Sumerian ruler Gudea, emphasizing the geometric planes and patterns in ancient sculptural portrayals of the king, an example of which is on view in this gallery.   Moore, too, was inspired by Sumerian sculptures, which he saw at the British Museum. Like Giacometti, he felt that they contained something essential about the human condition. Moore was especially fascinated by the relationship between the head and clasped hands, as seen in the statuary unearthed by Frankfort, finding there, as he put it, \u201ca wealth of meaning.\u201d The exhibition includes Moore\u2019s Seated Figure and Half Figure II (both 1929), each depicting, with simple, powerful forms, a female figure with clasped hands.   Later, the strongly frontal pose and staring, hypnotic eyes of de Kooning\u2019s iconic \u201cWoman\u201d series, represented here by two oil-on-paper works (1953\u201354 and 1967), also evoke Sumerian sculpture. Indeed, the artist, who saw artifacts from the Diyala Valley site of Tell Asmar at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, noted that the grins on the faces of his \u201cWoman\u201d paintings are \u201crather like the Mesopotamian idols.\u201d The examples here are shown next to an iconic Tell Asmar worshipper statue that de Kooning had surely seen at the Museum.   Reflecting contemporary viewpoints, many artists today return archaeological artifacts to their role as windows onto human history and cultures rather than as aesthetic objects. Archaeology and Aesthetics hig lights this with work by Jananne al-Ani, who was born in Kirkuk, Iraq, and lives and works in London, and the Chicago-based Michael Rakowitz, who is of Iraqi-Jewish heritage. Both al-Ani and Rakowitz create art expressive of the traumatic loss of human heritage caused by wars and spreading conflict in the Near- and Middle East.   Al-Ani\u2019s subtle and moving Untitled May 1991 [Gulf War Work] takes the form of a grid of photographs of subjects ranging from family members, to Sumerian artifacts, to news images of what has become known as \u201cthe first Gulf War.\u201d The work mixes individual with collective histories, evoking the loss of the artist\u2019s family history and cultural heritage while providing the personal perspective of inhabitants that is so often missing from media portrayals of war.   Rakowitz\u2019s powerful, eloquent installation The Invisible Enemy Should not Exist (Recovered, Missing, Stolen) (2003) comprises lifesized reproductions of Mesopotamian artifacts that are missing (or were in 2003) from the collection of the National Museum of Iraq, in Baghdad. The work varies in size depending on where it is installed; at ISAW it comprises 25 reproductions. With each object made of a mass-produced, readily available Iraqi product, such as cigarette cases and milk cartons, The Invisible Enemy draws a parallel between their cheap disposability and the treatment of the priceless evidence of human heritage that was looted or treated as waste after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Hide biography.      Sandra Shapshay is an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Indiana University. Her interests center on 19 th century German philosophy, especially Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as contemporary aesthetics and ethics. Recently she has been working on reconstructing facets of Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic theory especially his theories of the sublime and tragedy in papers that have appeared in the Kantian Review, the British Journal of Aesthetics , and J. Levinson, ed. Suffering Art Gladly. She has also investigated Schopenhauer\u2019s theory of freedom in a paper co-authored with Alex Neill and published in the International Yearbook of German Idealism . Currently, Shapshay is working on a book provisionally titled Degrees of Inherent Value: Schopenhauer\u2019s Ethical Thought that reconstructs Schopenhauer\u2019s ethics of compassion and argues that it offers a hybrid Kantian-Moral Sense theory of ethics that promises to interject a novel, less-anthropocentric option into the ethical-theoretical landscape.

With an instrumentation of Pierrot and percussion, the ensemble is dedicated to performing new and relevant works by contemporary composers, including Iannis Xenakis, Pierre Boulez, Jacob Druckman, Philip Glass, and Julia Wolfe, as well as up-and-coming composers such as Andy Akiho and Timothy Andres. To date, the NYUCME has premiered nearly 25 new works by NYU graduate students of the NYU Program in Music Composition. The ensemble maintains the highest standards of excellence and sustains a rigorous rehearsal and performance schedule. The top NYU students are selected, based on audition, for participation in the ensemble. Recent significant performances include Philip Glass&rsquo;s Fall of the House of Usher in collaboration with the NYU Program in Vocal Performance, the world premiere of Lars Graugaard's Three Places, the world premiere of Zachary Redler's Windows, as well as appearances at the 2012 and 2013 Bang on a Can Marathon in New York City.    Recordings:        Plekto - Iannis Xenakis    Plekt&oacute; is one of Xenakis&rsquo; lesser-known works, composed in the later part of his career. The piece was premiered in 1994 at the Wittener Tage f&uuml;r Neue Kammermusik, by the Ensemble K&ouml;ln. The title stems from the Greek verb &ldquo;plek,&rdquo; which means, &ldquo;to weave.&rdquo; Throughout the work, a variety of contrapuntal shapes and textures are woven together, although unlike many of Xenakis&rsquo; works where these lines contribute to an overall mass of sound, he seems to have placed much more emphasis on the individual in Plekt&oacute;. In addition, the work features a multi-metric section in which each of the six performers are playing at different tempi, similar to one of Xenakis&rsquo; earlier pieces, Persephassa.        Miss Donnithorne's Maggot was conceived at the party following the first performance in 1969 of Eight Songs for a Mad King . Randolph Stow, who wrote the text for the very serious and tragic Eight Songs said, &ldquo;Let's write a funny one, as a sequel.&rdquo; Miss Donnithorne was born five years later, and her music is more introvert, more contemplative, and, I would think, ultimately more disturbing than that written for George III, the Mad King, certainly only &ldquo;funny&rdquo; in a most qualified manner. The music refers constantly to the Victorian salon music with which one must assume Miss Donnithorne was familiar. After the Prelude, her song Green Mooned the White Lady is even strophic, in the manner of a Victorian ballad. The next song starts with a quotation from Shakespeare's Hamlet, &ldquo;They say the owl was a baker's daughter,&rdquo; and the ensemble evokes an empty house full of clocks, at first ticking, and eventually chiming and jangling through the protagonist's disturbed, distorted memories of her tragic wedding day. The Harbour Lay on Her Indigo Back is based on a dump, an Elizabethan dance form, but the surface is close to a Victorian quadrille. The purely instrumental Nocturne that follows is a dreamy distant cousin of Gustav Lange's Blumenlied, a very popular display piece for aspiring late nineteenth-century lady pianists. In Her Rant (On the Doorsills of My Cake) Miss Donnithorne hears sailors drill-marching: her betrothed was a sailor, the music is essentially military - except for her vulgar excursions into Jenny Lind-like operatic recitative. In the following recitative, In the Dusty Afternoon, the Victorian piano style becomes even more distorted into her over-heated personal memories and fantasies, while the violin accompaniment to her actual words suggests the theatrical traditions of Victorian music hall. (Could such a well-bred Victorian lady ever have visited such a common establishment?) Her final reel (Hark, Hark, His Voice!) refers to both Mendelssohn's and Wagner's Wedding March, and quite literally has the lady reeling drunk on her own dandelion wine, as her fantasies about her betrothed become ever more lurid. In her ramblings she hears a bosun's whistle (is it the wind through the trees?), evoking the presence of the betrothed in the next room. She ecstatically rushes into his imagined arms, to a cheap tune summing up the whole masquerade, and we realize that she is imprisoned absolutely in these imaginings in this music, forever estranged and alone. (Peter Maxwell Davies)                          Bash for flute, clarinet, percussion, piano, violin, viola, cello, bass is a joyful party of clashing ideas, Bash is the third piece of a trilogy for quartet, duo and octet of similar instrumentation, in which the musical theme originates in Headspring, wanders around in Wander &amp; Wonder, and clashes with itself in Bash . (Ruben Naeff) After studying mathematics and music in Amsterdam and working some years as an economist, Ruben Naeff is currently enrolled in a graduate program at New York University, where he studies composition with Michael Gordon. Ruben&rsquo;s broad interest led to many interdisciplinary pieces like De B&egrave;tacanon (about the hard sciences), The Dancing Dollar (about the current financial crisis), and the YouOpera .
