Holly Ajala - College of Arts and Science                               Holly Ajala is a third year pre-law student at CAS. She is currently pursuing a major in Politics and a minor in Africana Studies. She is the first-generation daughter of Nigerian parents, and considers herself a \u201cthird culture kid.\u201d She credits her parents for imbuing her with a love of learning and travel. In 2014, she managed to visit 11 cities in 7 countries, and she\u2019s excited to make Abu Dhabi her 12th city and 8th country in 12 months. She is actively involved in the New Generation mentorship program in hometown of Denver Colorado, and works as a Collaborate Writing Partner at Humanities Prepatory High School. Holly is passionate about mentorship and peer support as she sees the facilitation of learning and unlearning as foundational to any social justice end. Holly strives to understand and demonstrate leadership through service and inclusion. She is especially interested in revolutionary concepts of leadership that are not predicated upon replicating oppressive hierarchical structures. In the spirit of avoiding the master\u2019s tools or weapons Holly wants to unpack traditional ideas of leadership that foreground the individual at the expensive of the collective. She firmly believes that the role of a leader is simply to organize and galvanize the myriad of talents within the individuals one hopes to lead. She sees leadership as a strictly collaborate process where instead of \u201cleading\u201d in a traditional sense, the focus is upon facilitation.                                                                                      Tyler Benjamin - Gallatin School of Individualized Studies                               Tyler Benjamin is currently a Sophomore at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where he is Concentrating in Wealth and Social Entrepreneurship with a Minor in Web Development and Programming because he is primarily interested in how non-profit organizations obtain wealth and maximize efficiency for the betterment of local communities. He is from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana where he first began his involvement in non-profit community work. At NYU he is a volunteer at Stride, a member of the Wasserman Diversity Student Advisory Board, and the Treasurer for Gallatin Student Council because he is passionate about addressing and dismantling the systemic inequalities that obstruct minority groups from accessing higher education; he comes for a lower-economic background and worked three jobs so that he could survive and afford a private education, as public education was\u2014and still is\u2014insufficient as a direct result of institutionalized inequity. Utilizing his experience gained at the NYU Global Leadership Summit, he hopes to achieve his dream of establishing a non-profit organization that would enable disenfranchised minorities to better access and complete higher education.                                                                                        Adam Brulhardt - College of Arts and Science                               My name is Adam Brulhardt, and I am from Long Island. I am in my penultimate year in CAS studying Mathematics at the Courant Institute, minoring in Spanish, whilst pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in Mathematics Education in Steinhardt. NYU has afforded me many opportunities to expand my leadership and teaching experience. Through the Alternative Breaks (AB) program, I worked with Outreach 360 in teaching English to primary school students in Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic, and led a trip this year to Tola, Nicaragua with Foundation for Sustainable Development to open a social pharmacy that provides health education. As a Resident Assistant at Lafayette, a Site Leader for AB, and Vice President of Administration of the Class Activities Board, I have learned what it means to be a leader in a community, and how complex leadership can be. I hope to be a leader of positive change in the mathematics education community. What makes mathematics so beautiful and interesting is the process. My philosophy is to use the process of logic, reasoning, and the desire for truth to motivate learning and problem solving, a skill that can be applied to any field, which is why my leadership initiative is to bridge the Mathematics and Mathematics Education departments as a means to improve pedagogical practices in Courant, and hopefully expand to other universities. I believe quality mathematics education creates better problem solvers who become impactful leaders of positive change.                                                                                      Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera S\u00e1nchez - NYU Shanghai                                From the southern lands of churros and flamenco, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera S\u00e1nchez lived most of his life in the rainy north of Spain, as well as the best place on Earth: the Canary Islands. Having moved to Hong Kong at the age of sixteen, where he studied at Li Po Chun United World College, Jos\u00e9 developed a surprisingly strong passion and interest towards China. Its culture and language, as well as its xi\u0103ol\u00f3ngb\u0101o and m\u00e1l\u00e0t\u00e0ng, collectively pushed him to attend NYU Shanghai, where he is currently a sophomore planning on majoring in Economics with a focus on Sino-European relations, as well as doing a minor in Chinese. Jos\u00e9 loves tasty tapas, summers in Spain, and his interest in theatre led him to become part of NYU Shanghai\u2019s first Reality Show, a musical theatre program dealing with health and wellness issues.

Garreth Chan - NYU Abu Dhabi                               My name is Garreth Chan and I\u2019m a sophomore from NYU Abu Dhabi. I am currently majoring in Social Research &amp; Public Policy and Music, and am considering a double minor in Philosophy and Peace Studies. I\u2019m currently doing a semester abroad in Buenos Aires, where I\u2019m focusing on health policies and learning Spanish.   Originally from Hong Kong, I\u2019ve worked for numerous organizations in countries such as Tanzania, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Thailand, the UAE and China, with underprivileged communities in mostly rural settings, doing primarily capacity building and training work for empowerment. I believe in the power of education, and promoting the quality of education in areas where infrastructure for basic school systems are lacking. I also am interested in investigating the use of music as a form of community building and cross-culture dialogue, drawing from my experience in music therapy with children victims of human trafficking in Cambodia.   Outside of my avid interest in community work, I play a lot of music and write poetry for my own leisure. I enjoy conversations over tea, taking long walks with my headphones on, and just hanging around in dining halls. I also enjoy learning about our school\u2019s support staff and faculty, and you will probably see me sitting with the security guards around campus!   I am looking forward to meeting all of you, and learning more about your interests and your inspiring work!

Last year, she served as a student employee for the Student Life and Athletics Department, and currently works for the NYU Shanghai Office of Student Life. She has also served as an NYU Shanghai Student Ambassador and Orientation Ambassador. Constantly trying to combine her interests of science and technology, international relations, and politics, she is very interested in leadership in every stage, whether it in at the club, school, or state level. Her love for animals and people has made her extremely inquisitive, and her life dream is to finish her bucket list, travel the entire world, and integrate with as many cultures as possible. Approachable and always looking for a conversation, she likes to live by Bill Nye\u2019s words, \u201cEveryone you will meet knows something you don\u2019t.\u201d                                                                                      Priya Chidambaram - Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Priya Chidambaram is a junior at NYU Steinhardt studying Global Public Health/Applied Psychology through the Global Institute of Public Health.

Her passion is social justice, which she is pursuing through her love for public health. She dreams of one day changing health policy in America so that marginalized populations have equal and fair access to quality healthcare across the country. Until that fateful day, you can find Priya trying to explain why having Pad Thai for 7 meals a week is not ironic for a public health major.

She attended the Orange County High School of the Arts, where she studied Creative Writing, was an editor for the school\u2019s nationally-recognized literary journal, and was named the best short story writer in her graduating class. Her first published story in the 2010 issue of Bitter Oleander addressed the daily struggles of a homeless veteran in Skid Row, LA. In 2012, she was a Young Arts finalist for her short stories and was named a Presidential Scholar of the Arts semifinalist.   Since graduating high school, she has worked in the fields of homelessness and anti-trafficking advocacy and has interned with leading non-profits in NYC, DC, and India. This past summer, she received the Gallatin Global Fellowship in Human Rights which funded her research with Durbar, an Indian sex worker collective. Next year, she will be studying in Berlin and researching the legalization of sex work and its effects on trafficking. Her work focuses on the intersections of advocacy and narrative. Currently, she is a Michael L. Probst scholar and was selected for the Liberal Studies Dean\u2019s Circle and the University Leadership Honors Course. She hopes to help give voice to the voiceless through her stories while also addressing institutional injustices through her research.                                                                                      Asha Kuziwa - Liberal Studies                               Hello everyone! My name is Asha Kuziwa and I am a Boston native coming from the NYU New York campus, but currently studying in Accra, Ghana. I\u2019m a junior in the Global Liberal Studies program, concentrating in Politics, Rights, and Development &amp;nbsp;with minors in Africana Studies and Social and Cultural Analysis. My course of study emphasizes study abroad as a major component of the program, and this semester will be my fourth studying abroad having spent my freshman year in Paris and last semester in London. I chose to study in Ghana because of my desire to immerse myself in the culture and community - I\u2019m passionate about localized community organizing in developing countries aimed at bringing people above the threshold of poverty and adding value to peoples lives. I\u2019m so excited to meet my fellow summit colleagues, and am excited to explore some complex topics of ethics and leadership with you next month!                                                                                        Hee Eun Kwon - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Hee Eun Kwon is a junior at New York University Abu Dhabi, where she is majoring in Social Research and Public Policy with a concentration in Economics and Music. Her academic and research interests lie in public policy regarding economic development and education, which was furthered by her experience interning with the Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi Foundation for Policy Research. She is also passionate about the international mobility of migrant workers, which led her to serve as an initiative leader for a student group providing assistance to migrant worker communities.    As a Korean raised in Dubai, Hee Eun is interested in bridging the different communities and worked as a resident assistant for her university. Her ambition to listen to the different voices of the communities led her to intern with various organizations such as Sakhi for South Asian Women and SAFIA: Korean Association for Safe Communities. Still faced with numerous questions at the third last semester of her undergraduate career, Hee Eun aims to continue her studies in the field and hopefully discover in what way she can best add value to the community.                                                                                      Kenny Lee - College of Arts and Science                               Kenny Lee is an avid film photographer, aspiring writer, passionate adventurer, and proud South Korean. He firmly believes in the power of inclusive leadership guided by informed intuition based on knowledge and experience. In joining this year\u2019s Global Leadership Summit, he is looking forward to sharing his experiences and passions with his fellow participants.   Since his return to NYU from his two-year military service in Korea, Kenny has been serving in many leadership roles on campus, gaining experiences and skills necessary for effective leadership. Recently, Kenny has started his journey with 18 other NYU Leadership Fellows to understand and expand their potential and capacity as student leaders to empower the rest of the student body. He is also a Resident Assistant at Founders Hall where he serves as a role model, peer educator, and policy enforcer for 730 residents in the building.   Prior to his current positions, Kenny collaborated on various projects with PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants in Seoul to critique third-party evaluations of client\u2019s long-term foreign assets, and witnessed how an organization uses its industry expertise to make executive decisions. Last year winter, Kenny travelled with his fellow NYU Alternative Breakers to Rio Grande Valley, the southernmost tip of Texas, and learned about how a small grassroots organization created a large impact to the local immigrant community.   Kenny is majoring in economics with minors in math and business. During his free time, you can find him curating his latest photography work on Tumblr, and crafting his next adventure plans.                                                                                      Lily Liu - NYU Shanghai                               Lily Liu is a Chinese girl who loves adventurous life. Her major is Business and Finance and she is minoring Interactive Media Arts. Recently she is developing a huge interest in investment banking. She finds out that looking into the volatility in financial market is challenging but interesting. She has been engaged in studying ethical dilemma for a long time, especially related to business. As one of the teenage representatives in AmCham Shanghai CSR Fellowship, Lily speaks out university students\u2019 expectations on the social responsibilities that corporates should take on. In addition to that, Lily is also doing a research project about business feasibilities in Yangtze River Belt with the help of WWF (World Wide Fund). She is calling on corporations to be responsible for the more and more severe pollution into Yangtze River, and to work towards sustainable development. She also loves education and aims at providing equal learning opportunities to students in rural areas. She is the co-founder of PEER Shanghai - an online education program. Lily also has a variety of interests. She is an amateur poet and has a collection of nearly 50 Chinese poems. During her free time, Lily loves travelling and playing musical instruments. She has been to every province in China and she has just come back from the amazing desert in Israel and beautiful mosques in Turkey. Among five musical instruments that she is familiar with, she loves piano the best and has been playing it for 16 years.                                                                                      Jean-Luc Marsh - College of Arts and Science                               Jean-Luc Marsh is a sophomore majoring in International Relations and minoring in Environmental Biology and Middle Eastern Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. Originally from Washington D.C., Jean-Luc moved around the country often as a child, traveling down the West Coast until finally settling in Orange County, California. Always in pursuit of warm weather following his bone-chilling reintroduction to East Coast winters, he is currently enjoying the austral summer while studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   Back in New York, Jean-Luc\u2019s studies of the Portuguese and Arabic languages use up the bulk of his hours, while he donates the remainder to writing for the Washington Square News, serving as a Section Editor for NYU\u2019s travel magazine, attending discussions hosted by the International Relations Society, and surreptitiously eating brigadeiro at Brazilian Society meetings. He has interned for the Consulate General of Peru in New York City, where he was tasked with the tracking down of stolen Inca artifacts in addition to more typical administrative jobs. Currently, he interns at Asociaci\u00f3n Amigos de la Patagonia (AAP), an environmental organization focused on enacting change through education, in Buenos Aires. His aspiration is to one day unite his dual passions for International Relations and Environmental Biology through a career in international resource dispute mediation, focusing on finding equitable solutions to natural resource problems, particularly those involving water.   When he is not rushing to catch the uptown six train or absent-mindedly repeating vocabulary from Al-Kitaab to himself, Jean-Luc can be found traipsing through the city with his camera, writing album reviews for indie music blog Pretty Much Amazing, or satisfying his pierogi addiction at Veselka.                                                                                      Djordje Modrakovic - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Djordje Modrakovic was born and raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he learned English watching Cartoon Network. Prior to coming to New York University Abu Dhabi, he studied at the United World College in Mostar, an international school aiming to facilitate post-conflict integrations of the ethnically divided city. Currently, he is a junior majoring in Psychology and Political Science.   Djordje enjoys travelling, having visited over 20 countries up to now. He studied abroad in London and in Buenos Aires, where he polished his Spanish. During the past two summers he was interning and doing research in New York City relevant for his two majors. The first summer there he worked as a psychiatric social worker at Fortune Society, an NGO in Long Island City committed to reintegration of previously incarcerated individuals. The next  summer he worked as a research assistant at the NYU Social Media and Political Participation Lab.   Djordje cares about community life, having served as a Resident Assistant and Hall Council Advisor in his sophomore year. Because he enjoyed and learned immensely from his job as a Resident Assistant, he will continue it in his senior year. At NYU Abu Dhabi he invests his free time in Student Interest Groups such as the Anchorage Society and Capoeira Club, which he took leadership of during his sophomore year. He was active volunteer at the Somali Social and Cultural Center in Abu Dhabi for a year and a half, where he taught an IELTS preparation course to night school students. If he still manages to find free time, he pursues personal projects such as the Hult Prize 2014, a social entrepreneurship competition, at which his team placed in the final round in Dubai.   He is very passionate about social justice and equality, human rights, being understood and understanding others around him. He hopes to build a career in Law fighting for the aforementioned causes.                                                                                      Shivani Mulji - College of Arts and Science                               Shivani Mulji is a third\u00ad-year Presidential Honors Scholar student in the College of Arts and Science, studying economics whilst on the pre\u00ad-medicine track. She was born in Tanzania but grew up in Queens, New York City. Her hobbies are exercising, reading, traveling and volunteering. Shivani is passionate about universal access to health\u00adcare in the United States and third world countries. Specifically, she would like to examine the role of economic policy\u00admaking in city and private health\u00adcare systems. In addition, Shivani is enthusiastic about strengthening education, and preserving the presence of art in our society. She has volunteered at various organizations around New York City, such as St. Luke\u2019s\u00ad Roosevelt Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital and the Queens Museum of Art, and London, like Action Tutoring and the SHINE Project. Under the international charity Free the Children, she has led a team of students to fundraise in order to build a clean water system for children in Ecuador and to raise awareness about children around the world suffering from exploitation, poverty and denial of education. Currently, she is planning to volunteer with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, a movement dedicated towards advancing cancer research, supporting patients and spreading awareness. After graduation, Shivani hopes to take a bridge year in order to continue working with non\u00adprofit healthcare organizations before attending medical school.                                                                                      Emina Osmandikovic - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Emina Osmandikovic - Coming from a post-war country, I am naturally inclined towards displacement as a phenomenon on a global scale and post-war conflict solving strategies. This was my driving force behind conducting a sociological research on Bosnian refugees in Denmark and Sweden, and contributing to the work of UNHCR in my home country by interning there for two months. This path shaped and gradually developed my interest towards Political Science which I am studying at NYUAD, along with a concentration in Arabic Language, which would be my third foreign language. Prior to my university years, I volunteered at a local Red Cross for two years and continued with the volunteering tradition by being engaged with the Future Centre for Special Needs for almost two years. I devoted my entire first year to interning at the Office of Community Relations where, as an Embassy Relations Assistant, I helped develop relationships between our community and embassies and diplomatic bodies in Abu Dhabi. I have always been interested in public speaking skills, thus I've been involved with MUN where I represented the colors of NYUAD in Helsinki and won the Most Distinguished Delegate Award, and our Debate Society where I travelled to Hong Kong as an adjudicator in my freshman year. This year I've been devoted to developing my organizational skills by being a Global Career Peer for our Career Development Center and a Residential Assistant for our Office of Residential Education. This prepared me for our NYUAD Regional Debate Tournament which I am organizing and will be chairing this April.                                                                                      Dora Palfi - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Dora Palfi is a junior at NYU Abu Dhabi majoring in Brain and Cognitive Sciences with Concentrations in Computer Science and Political Science. She is an aspiring scientist who is extremely interested in understanding how the human brain works, especially the mechanisms behind higher cognitive functions such as decision-making. Dora is just as passionate about teaching as about learning, she has been tutoring natural sciences and English as second language and had been teaching sport classes to children in both Abu Dhabi and Spain. One of her favorite teaching experience was volunteering at the Abu Dhabi Science festival where she had the chance to share her passion with more than a hundred children throughout the span of the 10-day program.   Dora is passionate about travelling, sports and health. She is a member of both the soccer and basketball teams at NYU Abu Dhabi and during her time in NY she was a member of the NYU running club. Dora was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary but after spending some time in Germany as an exchange student and participating in a summer Youth Leadership Program in the US she became interested in continuing her studies abroad. Since starting college in Abu Dhabi she has spent semesters in Madrid and New York and took courses in Florence and Buenos Aires. Due to her travels Dora developed a great appreciation for art history and photography.                                                                                      Toma Pavlov - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Toma Pavlov is a sophomore at NYU Abu Dhabi, where he studies Political Science. Originally from Bulgaria, Toma has extensive international experience starting with a year in the U.S. as a high school exchange student and moving through Abu Dhabi, Nepal and Shanghai to Berlin, where he currently studies.    Since his freshmen year, he has been the president of the European Student Interest Group at his school. Pavlov has initiated and facilitated important discussions on the future of Europe in response to current events, such as the 2014 Euromaidan revolution in Kiev, Ukraine, aiming to raise awareness among the diverse student body.    In May 2014, he was the organizer and MC of the first Europe Day celebration held in the UAE. Approximately 200 students and professors from leading universities in the country were engaged in an informal dialogue with more than 21 European ambassadors and local officials centered on the challenges and prospects facing Europe and the UAE. H.H. Sheikh Nahyan, UAE Minister of Culture, Youth, and Social Development was a special guest of honor at the event. The now-annual commemoration led to the creation of an inter-university platform for partnerships in culture, science and technology.    Toma Pavlov believes that the quality of being ethical and respectful toward others is crucial, and that we should remind ourselves more often of this as the world becomes increasingly globalized and diversified. Only through mutual understanding and tolerance, we would be able to achieve peace. Nowadays the young people have access the more resources and information that is a great privilege, but also with it comes the responsibility of being both critical and considerate.                                                                                      Tyler Rhorick - NYU Shanghai                               Raised in the southern United States, Tyler (Rhorick) possesses a love for \u201cSo Sweet You\u2019ll Slap Your Momma\u201d Sweet Tea (a concept sadly unheard of in China), firmly believes that everyone else\u2019s \u201cwalking speed\u201d is the equivalent to a brisk jog, and usually cannot help slipping into a slight \u201cSouthern Accent\u201d when he talks about Southern cooking (which he has and will continue to debate is the best food that has ever existed). Having only recently obtained his passport, Tyler is excited to be given the chance to see the world. If he\u2019s not among friends, laughter, and the illusion of studying, you might want to start looking for him. Although he still does not know what his major is, he\u2019s been enjoying the chance to explore different types of course work and has learned the most so far from his fellow classmates. At NYU Shanghai, Tyler is currently involved with the NYU Shanghai Student Government, On Century Avenue (NYU Shanghai\u2019s Student Newspaper), NYU Shanghai\u2019s Dean\u2019s Service Scholars Program, and school club life. In the past, Tyler was also been a part of the NYU Shanghai Honors Council Ad Hoc Creation Committee, which worked on creating the structure of NYU Shanghai\u2019s Honors Council. He is excited to see what he might learn during his stay in the United Arab Emirates!                                                                                      Tiffany Rodriguez - Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Tiffany Rodriguez is a sophomore at NYU Steinhardt majoring in Childhood and Special Education with a concentration in English. She hopes to become a teacher in New York City. One of her dreams is to help close the achievement gap between socio-economic classes. She is currently spending a semester at NYU London. In New York, she was the secretary for the NYU DREAM Team, a club that organizes, advocates, and supports undocumented students in gaining access to higher education and a safe space at New York University. Tiffany is also a L.O.V.E. (Latinas on the Verge of Excellence) mentor. During the summit, she hopes to explore the intertwinement of ethics, morals and values, and whether any of those concepts are rooted in cultural or religious beliefs. Personally, she hopes that the conference will help equip her with the skills and confidence to better herself and become an effective leader. She\u2019d also like to work on her public speaking.                                                                                        Rachel Rondon - College of Arts and Science                               Rachel Rondon is a Junior at NYU College of Arts and Sciences majoring in Psychology with a minor in Economics. Rachel has always been curious by nature and she has never felt the need to follow a conventional path. Two of her main goals in life are to travel the world and start her own bakery. By her senior year of High School, Rachel had convinced herself that she wanted to be a linguist and thus spent her senior year studying Japanese, French, Italian, and American Sign Language, despite already being fluent in English and Spanish. Once she began college, it didn\u2019t take her long to realize that her true fascination lies in studying human interaction. She is interested in studying intra/inter group dynamics, implicit biases, and unconscious impressions. When she isn\u2019t studying or in class, Rachel dedicates herself to the endless pursuit of knowledge; which includes watching documentaries and TED talks, listening to podcasts, reading, and stumbling through the internet. Despite little involvement in clubs or extracurricular activities, Rachel likes helping people. She donates money in support of World Education and ending world hunger and homelessness whenever she can, and recently became involved with making and sending care packages to soldiers overseas. She believes that to be a leader she must be the best version of herself, someone that she can be proud of and who has a positive impact on the lives of others.                                                                                      Hediya Sizar - Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Hediya Sizar is a sophomore at New York University, majoring in Media, Culture, and Communications and minoring in Psychology. As a committed honors student and teaching assistant at NYU, Hediya is deeply interested in digital media practice and organizational communication. Aside from being immersed in New York City\u2019s diverse culture and media industry, Hediya runs a non-profit organization, The Bring on the Books Foundation, which currently has donated over 70,000 books to combat the limited access of literacy to impoverished youth in America.    As a result, today Hediya\u2019s strong commitment to service and awareness of social issues has brought her to become passionate in interfaith work. This year, Hediya co-chaired NYU\u2019s Fast-a-Thon 2014,raising $34,000 in humanitarian aid for the Gaza crisis. In addition, Hediya serves as President of World Faith at NYU, a member of the Multifaith Advisory Council for NYU\u2019s Global Center of Spiritual Life, and was recently honored with the Community Choice Award by NYU\u2019s Islamic Center.    As a current NYU Leadership Fellow Hediya is committed to building a strong, community at NYU and seeks to live a value-driven life, where she can make meaningful differences in the world.&quot;                                                                                      Norbert Sobczak - Liberal Studies                               Norbert Sobczak is a sophomore-year student at NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies school with interests history, politics, writing, and travel. His more specific academic interests revolve around the topics of war, conflict resolution, and human rights. Norbert\u2019s passions influenced his decision to spend freshman year at NYU in London where he both studied and traveled extensively, and the first semester of sophomore year at NYU Washington, DC where he took classes and interned at the House of Representatives for Congressman Bill Pascrell (Democrat, NJ District 9). He has been involved in student government as President of Student Council at NYUL, Site Ambassador for NYUDC and Secretary of Advocacy in the NYUDC Hall Congress. Currently, Norbert is an administrative intern at the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science, Program in International Relations. He has also been chosen for Dean\u2019s Circle, a LS school research seminar focused on the topic of globalization of education, where he is exploring the educational influence of the former British Empire. Norbert is also a member of the University Leadership Honors Course, a prestigious NYU-wide leadership development seminar. Outside of school, he is an equestrian and a collector of historic and military memorabilia.                                                                                        Griffin Sutherland - College of Nursing                               Hello, my name is Griffin Sutherland. I am from Denver, Colorado, and I am a junior in the College of Nursing at NYU studying nursing. My NYU story has planted its\u2019 roots in a variety of different communities. I am a Resident Assistant at NYU\u2019s largest, first-year residence hall, Third Avenue North. I am also a member of the Admissions Ambassadors Program. Finally, I sing in NYU\u2019s original, all male a cappella group, Mass Transit. I have been exceptionally fortunate in having the opportunity to call these peers my friends, teachers, and mentors. All of these communities have helped shape my own moral compass, and create my own unique NYU experience.   I am absolutely honored and ecstatic to have been invited to participate in the NYU Leadership Summit for 2015. In a rapidly intersecting world, there is a call for collaboration to help advance science, preserve art, and honor humanity in order to best understand differences and internalize various contexts. As a nursing student, I aspire to explore global health through international, non-governmental organizations, like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8rs, whom provide access to healthcare for disenfranchised people despite profound ethical, political, and social turmoil. In order to gain momentum on a large-scale, it is important to reach out across various communities to increase support and understanding of the issues. The collection of global perspectives at NYU drives my passion for leadership, and it is this idea of integration that I am most excited to explore at the Summit.                                                                                      Liza Tait-Bailey - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Liza Tait-Bailey is currently a sophomore at NYU Abu Dhabi currently studying Social Research and Public Policy. Originally from England, Liza always loves to explore ethical issues, respecting the opinion of others whilst championing equal rights wherever possible. While at NYUAD, Liza\u2019s love for social science took form in an ethnography of The Gazelle, an independent student led publication, the first of its kind in the UAE, while leading its social media department. In order to connect to the community of Abu Dhabi Liza interned with the Office of Community Outreach at NYUAD, co-organizing programs for local migrant workers. Her proudest achievement however, came in the form of the peer-support group she co-founded after noticing a gap between students needs and actual provisions when it came to mental health. Through these events Liza has become not only a leader, but a team player, realizing that organization, delegation and a firm vision are important but that nothing is as key to being a good leader as empathy, listening to those with the quietest voices and seeking out the best in every member of a team.                                                                                        Ying Xin Tan - College of Arts and Science                               Ying Xin Tan is a sophomore in the College of Arts and Science, currently pursuing a double major in Environmental Studies and Economics. She is interested in sustainable development and environmental design. Growing up in Singapore, a country smaller than New York City, also fostered her interest in urban greening and city planning. To that end, she has completed internships at the National Environment Agency of Singapore as well as DP Architects.   At NYU, Ying Xin is part of the Sport Taekwondo team that travels to compete in the Eastern Collegiate Taekwondo Conference. She has also served as the Community Service Officer of Middle C, a service a capella group that performs at charity events and volunteers at hospitals and nursing homes.   She enjoys running, be it in sun or snow, to discover new places and explore other neighborhoods. She also loves yoga, drawing \u2013 or doodling \u2013 and watching movies. An avid traveler, she is currently spending the spring semester at NYU Berlin and is taking every available opportunity to explore Germany and Europe. She would definitely encourage everyone to visit Germany for its history, culture and beautiful architecture.                                                                                      Christine Tran - College of Arts and Science                               Christine Tran is currently a junior and Merit Scholar in the College of Arts &amp; Science, majoring in Biochemistry with minors in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Spanish. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Christine currently lives in Fountain Valley, California. Christine\u2019s move to New York University sparked her conviction to find a voice and create impact in a diverse student framework.    As an Admissions Ambassador and Wasserman Student Liaison, Christine has been a panel speaker for NYU student initiatives and the college transition.

Christine is also a residential assistant at Alumni Residence Hall, as well as former President of the NYU Vietnamese Student Association and Public Relations Chair of Asian Heritage Month.    Christine\u2019s involvement in service groups, such as the Manhattan GO Project, demonstrate her commitment to ethical action in an interconnected world. Christine believes every student has the ability to become a leader and dedicates her energy to helping her peers realize this potential, inside and outside the classroom.

Sarah Xie - Liberal Studies                               Sarah Xie is a sophomore in the Liberal Studies Program, studying Global Liberal Studies with a concentration in Histories, Philosophies and Worldviews and a minor in Chinese Language. In high school, Sarah was heavily involved in the Big Brother/Big Sister mentoring program and saw there was a need for a support system for shy students who need someone to talk to. Coming to NYU, she began to explore other ways of making a difference in society. Sarah joined Peer Health Exchange, or PHE, and was exposed to students from different backgrounds. The mission of PHE is to give teens the knowledge and skills they need to make informed choices. In addition, she was introduced to the national organization Women and Youth Supporting Each Other (W.Y.S.E.) in her sophomore year and is currently mentoring 8th grade girls, a lot of whom lack role models or even involved parents. Sarah also has the honor of being one of the Liberal Studies Leaders, and helps freshmen in the Liberal Studies Core Program and Global Liberal Studies Program acclimate to New York City and New York University. Once every few weeks, Sarah goes back home to New Jersey and helps out at her mother\u2019s clinic, as she has done since she was twelve.    Sarah also loves to dance ballet, modern and hip hop, and to curl up with a good book. She is excited to share her knowledge and experiences with others and to learn from them. Sarah is also enthusiastic about developing her leadership skills and further improve how she approaches her programs and make them more effective for her mentees/students.

She transferred from Suffolk County Community College during the Fall 2014 semester and is recognized as a Community College Transfer Opportunity scholarship recipient.   To live, go to school, and work in Manhattan was a dream of Amanda's since a young age. She also knew at a young age that the fashion industry was her calling in life.   Currently, Amanda is a Public Relations intern for American television personality, author, and the most prominent publicist in the fashion industry, Kelly Cutrone at People's Revolution.   Amanda is also an editorial contributor for socialmediaweek.org's global platform where she writes about marketing, business, and culture from a millennial point of view. Amanda will be speaking at her own session during Social Media Week after Fashion Week in New York.

Holly Ajala - College of Arts and Science                               Holly Ajala is a third year pre-law student at CAS. She is currently pursuing a major in Politics and a minor in Africana Studies. She is the first-generation daughter of Nigerian parents, and considers herself a \u201cthird culture kid.\u201d She credits her parents for imbuing her with a love of learning and travel. In 2014, she managed to visit 11 cities in 7 countries, and she\u2019s excited to make Abu Dhabi her 12th city and 8th country in 12 months. She is actively involved in the New Generation mentorship program in hometown of Denver Colorado, and works as a Collaborate Writing Partner at Humanities Prepatory High School. Holly is passionate about mentorship and peer support as she sees the facilitation of learning and unlearning as foundational to any social justice end. Holly strives to understand and demonstrate leadership through service and inclusion. She is especially interested in revolutionary concepts of leadership that are not predicated upon replicating oppressive hierarchical structures. In the spirit of avoiding the master\u2019s tools or weapons Holly wants to unpack traditional ideas of leadership that foreground the individual at the expensive of the collective. She firmly believes that the role of a leader is simply to organize and galvanize the myriad of talents within the individuals one hopes to lead. She sees leadership as a strictly collaborate process where instead of \u201cleading\u201d in a traditional sense, the focus is upon facilitation.                                                                                      Tyler Benjamin - Gallatin School of Individualized Studies                               Tyler Benjamin is currently a Sophomore at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where he is Concentrating in Wealth and Social Entrepreneurship with a Minor in Web Development and Programming because he is primarily interested in how non-profit organizations obtain wealth and maximize efficiency for the betterment of local communities. He is from Breaux Bridge, Louisiana where he first began his involvement in non-profit community work. At NYU he is a volunteer at Stride, a member of the Wasserman Diversity Student Advisory Board, and the Treasurer for Gallatin Student Council because he is passionate about addressing and dismantling the systemic inequalities that obstruct minority groups from accessing higher education; he comes for a lower-economic background and worked three jobs so that he could survive and afford a private education, as public education was\u2014and still is\u2014insufficient as a direct result of institutionalized inequity. Utilizing his experience gained at the NYU Global Leadership Summit, he hopes to achieve his dream of establishing a non-profit organization that would enable disenfranchised minorities to better access and complete higher education.                                                                                        Adam Brulhardt - College of Arts and Science                               My name is Adam Brulhardt, and I am from Long Island. I am in my penultimate year in CAS studying Mathematics at the Courant Institute, minoring in Spanish, whilst pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in Mathematics Education in Steinhardt. NYU has afforded me many opportunities to expand my leadership and teaching experience. Through the Alternative Breaks (AB) program, I worked with Outreach 360 in teaching English to primary school students in Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic, and led a trip this year to Tola, Nicaragua with Foundation for Sustainable Development to open a social pharmacy that provides health education. As a Resident Assistant at Lafayette, a Site Leader for AB, and Vice President of Administration of the Class Activities Board, I have learned what it means to be a leader in a community, and how complex leadership can be. I hope to be a leader of positive change in the mathematics education community. What makes mathematics so beautiful and interesting is the process. My philosophy is to use the process of logic, reasoning, and the desire for truth to motivate learning and problem solving, a skill that can be applied to any field, which is why my leadership initiative is to bridge the Mathematics and Mathematics Education departments as a means to improve pedagogical practices in Courant, and hopefully expand to other universities. I believe quality mathematics education creates better problem solvers who become impactful leaders of positive change.                                                                                      Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera S\u00e1nchez - NYU Shanghai                                From the southern lands of churros and flamenco, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cabrera S\u00e1nchez lived most of his life in the rainy north of Spain, as well as the best place on Earth: the Canary Islands. Having moved to Hong Kong at the age of sixteen, where he studied at Li Po Chun United World College, Jos\u00e9 developed a surprisingly strong passion and interest towards China. Its culture and language, as well as its xi\u0103ol\u00f3ngb\u0101o and m\u00e1l\u00e0t\u00e0ng, collectively pushed him to attend NYU Shanghai, where he is currently a sophomore planning on majoring in Economics with a focus on Sino-European relations, as well as doing a minor in Chinese. Jos\u00e9 loves tasty tapas, summers in Spain, and his interest in theatre led him to become part of NYU Shanghai\u2019s first Reality Show, a musical theatre program dealing with health and wellness issues. Jos\u00e9 also enjoyes doing volunteering work, particularly with animal organizations such as Sea Turtles 911 in southern China, and Promar, in Spain. At the university, he can be found working as a resident assistant and leading the Breaking Barriers Initiative, a project aiming to foster meaningful cross-cultural interaction of the student body within the university itself and the NYU Global Network at large.                                                                                      Emily Carlson - College of Arts and Science                               Emily Carlson is an English major and Creative Writing minor in the College of Arts and Sciences. She was born and raised in West Windsor, New Jersey, and has spent as much time as possible in college exploring NYU\u2019s global network. She studied in Florence during the Fall 2013 and Summer 2014 semesters and was involved with NYU\u2019s La Pietra Dialogues, Ars et Fides, and Hashtag NYU\u2019s Global Storyteller initiative. She studied in London Fall 2014, where she wrote for Bedford Square News and worked as a volunteer Marketing and Communications Intern at Special Olympics Great Britain. She has been actively involved in her hometown Special Olympics where she has worked as a summer camp counselor and helped organize annual fundraisers. She has also been a member and president of her local 4-H club for seven years. She is extremely excited to go to Abu Dhabi and to work with other students to explore the issue of ethics of leadership in today\u2019s world.                                                                                      Garreth Chan - NYU Abu Dhabi                               My name is Garreth Chan and I\u2019m a sophomore from NYU Abu Dhabi. I am currently majoring in Social Research &amp; Public Policy and Music, and am considering a double minor in Philosophy and Peace Studies. I\u2019m currently doing a semester abroad in Buenos Aires, where I\u2019m focusing on health policies and learning Spanish.   Originally from Hong Kong, I\u2019ve worked for numerous organizations in countries such as Tanzania, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Thailand, the UAE and China, with underprivileged communities in mostly rural settings, doing primarily capacity building and training work for empowerment. I believe in the power of education, and promoting the quality of education in areas where infrastructure for basic school systems are lacking. I also am interested in investigating the use of music as a form of community building and cross-culture dialogue, drawing from my experience in music therapy with children victims of human trafficking in Cambodia.   Outside of my avid interest in community work, I play a lot of music and write poetry for my own leisure. I enjoy conversations over tea, taking long walks with my headphones on, and just hanging around in dining halls. I also enjoy learning about our school\u2019s support staff and faculty, and you will probably see me sitting with the security guards around campus!   I am looking forward to meeting all of you, and learning more about your interests and your inspiring work!                                                                                      Lathika Chandra Mouli - NYU Shanghai                               Lathika Chandra Mouli is a sophomore pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering at NYU Shanghai. She was born in Gwalior, India, but was raised in Bangkok, Thailand, and has been living in Shanghai, China since her freshman year in college. As part of the inaugural class of NYU Shanghai, she has been very active in several programs in school including, but not limited to, founding the Model United Nations Club, the Food &amp; Festivals Club, the weekly student publication On Century Avenue, the Deans\u2019 Service Scholars Program, Student Government, and the Peer Advisor Program. Last year, she served as a student employee for the Student Life and Athletics Department, and currently works for the NYU Shanghai Office of Student Life. She has also served as an NYU Shanghai Student Ambassador and Orientation Ambassador. Constantly trying to combine her interests of science and technology, international relations, and politics, she is very interested in leadership in every stage, whether it in at the club, school, or state level. Her love for animals and people has made her extremely inquisitive, and her life dream is to finish her bucket list, travel the entire world, and integrate with as many cultures as possible. Approachable and always looking for a conversation, she likes to live by Bill Nye\u2019s words, \u201cEveryone you will meet knows something you don\u2019t.\u201d                                                                                      Priya Chidambaram - Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Priya Chidambaram is a junior at NYU Steinhardt studying Global Public Health/Applied Psychology through the Global Institute of Public Health.

Back at NYU New York, she spends her time with various NYU departments. She gives tours for the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions, represents the health and wellness needs of the student body as a Health Leader for the Health Promotion Office, advises incoming students as a Liberal Studies Student Leader, and works at NYU Carlyle Court, one of NYU\u2019s residence halls. She has also interned at Media 4 Humanity, a non-profit that works to end child trafficking in America, and maslansky+partners, a communications firm in downtown Manhattan. More recently, she spent 4 months interning at the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior, and Prevention Studies, where she helped to advance the center\u2019s mission of improving the lives of those affected by HIV, substance abuse, and mental health burden.    Her passion is social justice, which she is pursuing through her love for public health. She dreams of one day changing health policy in America so that marginalized populations have equal and fair access to quality healthcare across the country. Until that fateful day, you can find Priya trying to explain why having Pad Thai for 7 meals a week is not ironic for a public health major.

I\u2019m a junior in the Global Liberal Studies program, concentrating in Politics, Rights, and Development &amp;nbsp;with minors in Africana Studies and Social and Cultural Analysis. My course of study emphasizes study abroad as a major component of the program, and this semester will be my fourth studying abroad having spent my freshman year in Paris and last semester in London. I chose to study in Ghana because of my desire to immerse myself in the culture and community - I\u2019m passionate about localized community organizing in developing countries aimed at bringing people above the threshold of poverty and adding value to peoples lives. I\u2019m so excited to meet my fellow summit colleagues, and am excited to explore some complex topics of ethics and leadership with you next month!                                                                                        Hee Eun Kwon - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Hee Eun Kwon is a junior at New York University Abu Dhabi, where she is majoring in Social Research and Public Policy with a concentration in Economics and Music. Her academic and research interests lie in public policy regarding economic development and education, which was furthered by her experience interning with the Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi Foundation for Policy Research. She is also passionate about the international mobility of migrant workers, which led her to serve as an initiative leader for a student group providing assistance to migrant worker communities.    As a Korean raised in Dubai, Hee Eun is interested in bridging the different communities and worked as a resident assistant for her university. Her ambition to listen to the different voices of the communities led her to intern with various organizations such as Sakhi for South Asian Women and SAFIA: Korean Association for Safe Communities. Still faced with numerous questions at the third last semester of her undergraduate career, Hee Eun aims to continue her studies in the field and hopefully discover in what way she can best add value to the community.                                                                                      Kenny Lee - College of Arts and Science                               Kenny Lee is an avid film photographer, aspiring writer, passionate adventurer, and proud South Korean. He firmly believes in the power of inclusive leadership guided by informed intuition based on knowledge and experience. In joining this year\u2019s Global Leadership Summit, he is looking forward to sharing his experiences and passions with his fellow participants.   Since his return to NYU from his two-year military service in Korea, Kenny has been serving in many leadership roles on campus, gaining experiences and skills necessary for effective leadership. Recently, Kenny has started his journey with 18 other NYU Leadership Fellows to understand and expand their potential and capacity as student leaders to empower the rest of the student body. He is also a Resident Assistant at Founders Hall where he serves as a role model, peer educator, and policy enforcer for 730 residents in the building.   Prior to his current positions, Kenny collaborated on various projects with PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants in Seoul to critique third-party evaluations of client\u2019s long-term foreign assets, and witnessed how an organization uses its industry expertise to make executive decisions. Last year winter, Kenny travelled with his fellow NYU Alternative Breakers to Rio Grande Valley, the southernmost tip of Texas, and learned about how a small grassroots organization created a large impact to the local immigrant community.   Kenny is majoring in economics with minors in math and business. During his free time, you can find him curating his latest photography work on Tumblr, and crafting his next adventure plans.                                                                                      Lily Liu - NYU Shanghai                               Lily Liu is a Chinese girl who loves adventurous life. Her major is Business and Finance and she is minoring Interactive Media Arts. Recently she is developing a huge interest in investment banking. She finds out that looking into the volatility in financial market is challenging but interesting. She has been engaged in studying ethical dilemma for a long time, especially related to business. As one of the teenage representatives in AmCham Shanghai CSR Fellowship, Lily speaks out university students\u2019 expectations on the social responsibilities that corporates should take on. In addition to that, Lily is also doing a research project about business feasibilities in Yangtze River Belt with the help of WWF (World Wide Fund). She is calling on corporations to be responsible for the more and more severe pollution into Yangtze River, and to work towards sustainable development. She also loves education and aims at providing equal learning opportunities to students in rural areas. She is the co-founder of PEER Shanghai - an online education program. Lily also has a variety of interests. She is an amateur poet and has a collection of nearly 50 Chinese poems. During her free time, Lily loves travelling and playing musical instruments. She has been to every province in China and she has just come back from the amazing desert in Israel and beautiful mosques in Turkey. Among five musical instruments that she is familiar with, she loves piano the best and has been playing it for 16 years.                                                                                      Jean-Luc Marsh - College of Arts and Science                               Jean-Luc Marsh is a sophomore majoring in International Relations and minoring in Environmental Biology and Middle Eastern Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. Originally from Washington D.C., Jean-Luc moved around the country often as a child, traveling down the West Coast until finally settling in Orange County, California. Always in pursuit of warm weather following his bone-chilling reintroduction to East Coast winters, he is currently enjoying the austral summer while studying abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   Back in New York, Jean-Luc\u2019s studies of the Portuguese and Arabic languages use up the bulk of his hours, while he donates the remainder to writing for the Washington Square News, serving as a Section Editor for NYU\u2019s travel magazine, attending discussions hosted by the International Relations Society, and surreptitiously eating brigadeiro at Brazilian Society meetings. He has interned for the Consulate General of Peru in New York City, where he was tasked with the tracking down of stolen Inca artifacts in addition to more typical administrative jobs. Currently, he interns at Asociaci\u00f3n Amigos de la Patagonia (AAP), an environmental organization focused on enacting change through education, in Buenos Aires. His aspiration is to one day unite his dual passions for International Relations and Environmental Biology through a career in international resource dispute mediation, focusing on finding equitable solutions to natural resource problems, particularly those involving water.   When he is not rushing to catch the uptown six train or absent-mindedly repeating vocabulary from Al-Kitaab to himself, Jean-Luc can be found traipsing through the city with his camera, writing album reviews for indie music blog Pretty Much Amazing, or satisfying his pierogi addiction at Veselka.                                                                                      Djordje Modrakovic - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Djordje Modrakovic was born and raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he learned English watching Cartoon Network. Prior to coming to New York University Abu Dhabi, he studied at the United World College in Mostar, an international school aiming to facilitate post-conflict integrations of the ethnically divided city. Currently, he is a junior majoring in Psychology and Political Science.   Djordje enjoys travelling, having visited over 20 countries up to now. He studied abroad in London and in Buenos Aires, where he polished his Spanish. During the past two summers he was interning and doing research in New York City relevant for his two majors. The first summer there he worked as a psychiatric social worker at Fortune Society, an NGO in Long Island City committed to reintegration of previously incarcerated individuals. The next  summer he worked as a research assistant at the NYU Social Media and Political Participation Lab.   Djordje cares about community life, having served as a Resident Assistant and Hall Council Advisor in his sophomore year. Because he enjoyed and learned immensely from his job as a Resident Assistant, he will continue it in his senior year. At NYU Abu Dhabi he invests his free time in Student Interest Groups such as the Anchorage Society and Capoeira Club, which he took leadership of during his sophomore year. He was active volunteer at the Somali Social and Cultural Center in Abu Dhabi for a year and a half, where he taught an IELTS preparation course to night school students. If he still manages to find free time, he pursues personal projects such as the Hult Prize 2014, a social entrepreneurship competition, at which his team placed in the final round in Dubai.   He is very passionate about social justice and equality, human rights, being understood and understanding others around him. He hopes to build a career in Law fighting for the aforementioned causes.                                                                                      Shivani Mulji - College of Arts and Science                               Shivani Mulji is a third\u00ad-year Presidential Honors Scholar student in the College of Arts and Science, studying economics whilst on the pre\u00ad-medicine track. She was born in Tanzania but grew up in Queens, New York City. Her hobbies are exercising, reading, traveling and volunteering. Shivani is passionate about universal access to health\u00adcare in the United States and third world countries. Specifically, she would like to examine the role of economic policy\u00admaking in city and private health\u00adcare systems. In addition, Shivani is enthusiastic about strengthening education, and preserving the presence of art in our society. She has volunteered at various organizations around New York City, such as St. Luke\u2019s\u00ad Roosevelt Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital and the Queens Museum of Art, and London, like Action Tutoring and the SHINE Project. Under the international charity Free the Children, she has led a team of students to fundraise in order to build a clean water system for children in Ecuador and to raise awareness about children around the world suffering from exploitation, poverty and denial of education. Currently, she is planning to volunteer with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, a movement dedicated towards advancing cancer research, supporting patients and spreading awareness. After graduation, Shivani hopes to take a bridge year in order to continue working with non\u00adprofit healthcare organizations before attending medical school.                                                                                      Emina Osmandikovic - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Emina Osmandikovic - Coming from a post-war country, I am naturally inclined towards displacement as a phenomenon on a global scale and post-war conflict solving strategies. This was my driving force behind conducting a sociological research on Bosnian refugees in Denmark and Sweden, and contributing to the work of UNHCR in my home country by interning there for two months. This path shaped and gradually developed my interest towards Political Science which I am studying at NYUAD, along with a concentration in Arabic Language, which would be my third foreign language. Prior to my university years, I volunteered at a local Red Cross for two years and continued with the volunteering tradition by being engaged with the Future Centre for Special Needs for almost two years. I devoted my entire first year to interning at the Office of Community Relations where, as an Embassy Relations Assistant, I helped develop relationships between our community and embassies and diplomatic bodies in Abu Dhabi. I have always been interested in public speaking skills, thus I've been involved with MUN where I represented the colors of NYUAD in Helsinki and won the Most Distinguished Delegate Award, and our Debate Society where I travelled to Hong Kong as an adjudicator in my freshman year. This year I've been devoted to developing my organizational skills by being a Global Career Peer for our Career Development Center and a Residential Assistant for our Office of Residential Education. This prepared me for our NYUAD Regional Debate Tournament which I am organizing and will be chairing this April.                                                                                      Dora Palfi - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Dora Palfi is a junior at NYU Abu Dhabi majoring in Brain and Cognitive Sciences with Concentrations in Computer Science and Political Science. She is an aspiring scientist who is extremely interested in understanding how the human brain works, especially the mechanisms behind higher cognitive functions such as decision-making. Dora is just as passionate about teaching as about learning, she has been tutoring natural sciences and English as second language and had been teaching sport classes to children in both Abu Dhabi and Spain. One of her favorite teaching experience was volunteering at the Abu Dhabi Science festival where she had the chance to share her passion with more than a hundred children throughout the span of the 10-day program.   Dora is passionate about travelling, sports and health. She is a member of both the soccer and basketball teams at NYU Abu Dhabi and during her time in NY she was a member of the NYU running club. Dora was born and raised in Budapest, Hungary but after spending some time in Germany as an exchange student and participating in a summer Youth Leadership Program in the US she became interested in continuing her studies abroad. Since starting college in Abu Dhabi she has spent semesters in Madrid and New York and took courses in Florence and Buenos Aires. Due to her travels Dora developed a great appreciation for art history and photography.                                                                                      Toma Pavlov - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Toma Pavlov is a sophomore at NYU Abu Dhabi, where he studies Political Science. Originally from Bulgaria, Toma has extensive international experience starting with a year in the U.S. as a high school exchange student and moving through Abu Dhabi, Nepal and Shanghai to Berlin, where he currently studies.    Since his freshmen year, he has been the president of the European Student Interest Group at his school. Pavlov has initiated and facilitated important discussions on the future of Europe in response to current events, such as the 2014 Euromaidan revolution in Kiev, Ukraine, aiming to raise awareness among the diverse student body.    In May 2014, he was the organizer and MC of the first Europe Day celebration held in the UAE. Approximately 200 students and professors from leading universities in the country were engaged in an informal dialogue with more than 21 European ambassadors and local officials centered on the challenges and prospects facing Europe and the UAE. H.H. Sheikh Nahyan, UAE Minister of Culture, Youth, and Social Development was a special guest of honor at the event. The now-annual commemoration led to the creation of an inter-university platform for partnerships in culture, science and technology.    Toma Pavlov believes that the quality of being ethical and respectful toward others is crucial, and that we should remind ourselves more often of this as the world becomes increasingly globalized and diversified. Only through mutual understanding and tolerance, we would be able to achieve peace. Nowadays the young people have access the more resources and information that is a great privilege, but also with it comes the responsibility of being both critical and considerate.                                                                                      Tyler Rhorick - NYU Shanghai                               Raised in the southern United States, Tyler (Rhorick) possesses a love for \u201cSo Sweet You\u2019ll Slap Your Momma\u201d Sweet Tea (a concept sadly unheard of in China), firmly believes that everyone else\u2019s \u201cwalking speed\u201d is the equivalent to a brisk jog, and usually cannot help slipping into a slight \u201cSouthern Accent\u201d when he talks about Southern cooking (which he has and will continue to debate is the best food that has ever existed). Having only recently obtained his passport, Tyler is excited to be given the chance to see the world. If he\u2019s not among friends, laughter, and the illusion of studying, you might want to start looking for him. Although he still does not know what his major is, he\u2019s been enjoying the chance to explore different types of course work and has learned the most so far from his fellow classmates. At NYU Shanghai, Tyler is currently involved with the NYU Shanghai Student Government, On Century Avenue (NYU Shanghai\u2019s Student Newspaper), NYU Shanghai\u2019s Dean\u2019s Service Scholars Program, and school club life. In the past, Tyler was also been a part of the NYU Shanghai Honors Council Ad Hoc Creation Committee, which worked on creating the structure of NYU Shanghai\u2019s Honors Council. He is excited to see what he might learn during his stay in the United Arab Emirates!                                                                                      Tiffany Rodriguez - Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Tiffany Rodriguez is a sophomore at NYU Steinhardt majoring in Childhood and Special Education with a concentration in English. She hopes to become a teacher in New York City. One of her dreams is to help close the achievement gap between socio-economic classes. She is currently spending a semester at NYU London. In New York, she was the secretary for the NYU DREAM Team, a club that organizes, advocates, and supports undocumented students in gaining access to higher education and a safe space at New York University. Tiffany is also a L.O.V.E. (Latinas on the Verge of Excellence) mentor. During the summit, she hopes to explore the intertwinement of ethics, morals and values, and whether any of those concepts are rooted in cultural or religious beliefs. Personally, she hopes that the conference will help equip her with the skills and confidence to better herself and become an effective leader. She\u2019d also like to work on her public speaking.                                                                                        Rachel Rondon - College of Arts and Science                               Rachel Rondon is a Junior at NYU College of Arts and Sciences majoring in Psychology with a minor in Economics. Rachel has always been curious by nature and she has never felt the need to follow a conventional path. Two of her main goals in life are to travel the world and start her own bakery. By her senior year of High School, Rachel had convinced herself that she wanted to be a linguist and thus spent her senior year studying Japanese, French, Italian, and American Sign Language, despite already being fluent in English and Spanish. Once she began college, it didn\u2019t take her long to realize that her true fascination lies in studying human interaction. She is interested in studying intra/inter group dynamics, implicit biases, and unconscious impressions. When she isn\u2019t studying or in class, Rachel dedicates herself to the endless pursuit of knowledge; which includes watching documentaries and TED talks, listening to podcasts, reading, and stumbling through the internet. Despite little involvement in clubs or extracurricular activities, Rachel likes helping people. She donates money in support of World Education and ending world hunger and homelessness whenever she can, and recently became involved with making and sending care packages to soldiers overseas. She believes that to be a leader she must be the best version of herself, someone that she can be proud of and who has a positive impact on the lives of others.                                                                                      Hediya Sizar - Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development                               Hediya Sizar is a sophomore at New York University, majoring in Media, Culture, and Communications and minoring in Psychology. As a committed honors student and teaching assistant at NYU, Hediya is deeply interested in digital media practice and organizational communication. Aside from being immersed in New York City\u2019s diverse culture and media industry, Hediya runs a non-profit organization, The Bring on the Books Foundation, which currently has donated over 70,000 books to combat the limited access of literacy to impoverished youth in America.    As a result, today Hediya\u2019s strong commitment to service and awareness of social issues has brought her to become passionate in interfaith work. This year, Hediya co-chaired NYU\u2019s Fast-a-Thon 2014,raising $34,000 in humanitarian aid for the Gaza crisis. In addition, Hediya serves as President of World Faith at NYU, a member of the Multifaith Advisory Council for NYU\u2019s Global Center of Spiritual Life, and was recently honored with the Community Choice Award by NYU\u2019s Islamic Center.    As a current NYU Leadership Fellow Hediya is committed to building a strong, community at NYU and seeks to live a value-driven life, where she can make meaningful differences in the world.&quot;                                                                                      Norbert Sobczak - Liberal Studies                               Norbert Sobczak is a sophomore-year student at NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies school with interests history, politics, writing, and travel. His more specific academic interests revolve around the topics of war, conflict resolution, and human rights. Norbert\u2019s passions influenced his decision to spend freshman year at NYU in London where he both studied and traveled extensively, and the first semester of sophomore year at NYU Washington, DC where he took classes and interned at the House of Representatives for Congressman Bill Pascrell (Democrat, NJ District 9). He has been involved in student government as President of Student Council at NYUL, Site Ambassador for NYUDC and Secretary of Advocacy in the NYUDC Hall Congress. Currently, Norbert is an administrative intern at the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science, Program in International Relations. He has also been chosen for Dean\u2019s Circle, a LS school research seminar focused on the topic of globalization of education, where he is exploring the educational influence of the former British Empire. Norbert is also a member of the University Leadership Honors Course, a prestigious NYU-wide leadership development seminar. Outside of school, he is an equestrian and a collector of historic and military memorabilia.                                                                                        Griffin Sutherland - College of Nursing                               Hello, my name is Griffin Sutherland. I am from Denver, Colorado, and I am a junior in the College of Nursing at NYU studying nursing. My NYU story has planted its\u2019 roots in a variety of different communities. I am a Resident Assistant at NYU\u2019s largest, first-year residence hall, Third Avenue North. I am also a member of the Admissions Ambassadors Program. Finally, I sing in NYU\u2019s original, all male a cappella group, Mass Transit. I have been exceptionally fortunate in having the opportunity to call these peers my friends, teachers, and mentors. All of these communities have helped shape my own moral compass, and create my own unique NYU experience.   I am absolutely honored and ecstatic to have been invited to participate in the NYU Leadership Summit for 2015. In a rapidly intersecting world, there is a call for collaboration to help advance science, preserve art, and honor humanity in order to best understand differences and internalize various contexts. As a nursing student, I aspire to explore global health through international, non-governmental organizations, like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8rs, whom provide access to healthcare for disenfranchised people despite profound ethical, political, and social turmoil. In order to gain momentum on a large-scale, it is important to reach out across various communities to increase support and understanding of the issues. The collection of global perspectives at NYU drives my passion for leadership, and it is this idea of integration that I am most excited to explore at the Summit.                                                                                      Liza Tait-Bailey - NYU Abu Dhabi                               Liza Tait-Bailey is currently a sophomore at NYU Abu Dhabi currently studying Social Research and Public Policy. Originally from England, Liza always loves to explore ethical issues, respecting the opinion of others whilst championing equal rights wherever possible. While at NYUAD, Liza\u2019s love for social science took form in an ethnography of The Gazelle, an independent student led publication, the first of its kind in the UAE, while leading its social media department. In order to connect to the community of Abu Dhabi Liza interned with the Office of Community Outreach at NYUAD, co-organizing programs for local migrant workers. Her proudest achievement however, came in the form of the peer-support group she co-founded after noticing a gap between students needs and actual provisions when it came to mental health. Through these events Liza has become not only a leader, but a team player, realizing that organization, delegation and a firm vision are important but that nothing is as key to being a good leader as empathy, listening to those with the quietest voices and seeking out the best in every member of a team.                                                                                        Ying Xin Tan - College of Arts and Science                               Ying Xin Tan is a sophomore in the College of Arts and Science, currently pursuing a double major in Environmental Studies and Economics. She is interested in sustainable development and environmental design. Growing up in Singapore, a country smaller than New York City, also fostered her interest in urban greening and city planning. To that end, she has completed internships at the National Environment Agency of Singapore as well as DP Architects.   At NYU, Ying Xin is part of the Sport Taekwondo team that travels to compete in the Eastern Collegiate Taekwondo Conference. She has also served as the Community Service Officer of Middle C, a service a capella group that performs at charity events and volunteers at hospitals and nursing homes.   She enjoys running, be it in sun or snow, to discover new places and explore other neighborhoods. She also loves yoga, drawing \u2013 or doodling \u2013 and watching movies. An avid traveler, she is currently spending the spring semester at NYU Berlin and is taking every available opportunity to explore Germany and Europe. She would definitely encourage everyone to visit Germany for its history, culture and beautiful architecture.                                                                                      Christine Tran - College of Arts and Science                               Christine Tran is currently a junior and Merit Scholar in the College of Arts &amp; Science, majoring in Biochemistry with minors in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Spanish. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Christine currently lives in Fountain Valley, California. Christine\u2019s move to New York University sparked her conviction to find a voice and create impact in a diverse student framework.    As an Admissions Ambassador and Wasserman Student Liaison, Christine has been a panel speaker for NYU student initiatives and the college transition. Speaking at both Off-Campus Receptions and Weekend on the Square events, Christine has shared her NYU experience with students with the hope of sparking their own curiosity in social and cultural awareness. Christine is also a residential assistant at Alumni Residence Hall, as well as former President of the NYU Vietnamese Student Association and Public Relations Chair of Asian Heritage Month.    Christine\u2019s involvement in service groups, such as the Manhattan GO Project, demonstrate her commitment to ethical action in an interconnected world. Christine believes every student has the ability to become a leader and dedicates her energy to helping her peers realize this potential, inside and outside the classroom.                                                                                      Jesus Vasquez - College of Arts and Science                               Jesus Vasquez is a junior at the College of Arts and Science pursuing a joint major in Mathematics and Economics with a pre-medical track. During Jesus\u2019 first year at NYU Jesus became involved in the Black Student Union as a black solidarity conference facilitator, the Gentlemen of Quality as a youth mentor, and Phi Delta Epsilon, a medical fraternity, as a volunteer at Montefiore Children\u2019s Hospital. Jesus is passionate about soccer, Brazilian jiu jitsu and Dragonboat racing.

In high school, Sarah was heavily involved in the Big Brother/Big Sister mentoring program and saw there was a need for a support system for shy students who need someone to talk to. Coming to NYU, she began to explore other ways of making a difference in society. Sarah joined Peer Health Exchange, or PHE, and was exposed to students from different backgrounds. The mission of PHE is to give teens the knowledge and skills they need to make informed choices. In addition, she was introduced to the national organization Women and Youth Supporting Each Other (W.Y.S.E.) in her sophomore year and is currently mentoring 8th grade girls, a lot of whom lack role models or even involved parents. Sarah also has the honor of being one of the Liberal Studies Leaders, and helps freshmen in the Liberal Studies Core Program and Global Liberal Studies Program acclimate to New York City and New York University. Once every few weeks, Sarah goes back home to New Jersey and helps out at her mother\u2019s clinic, as she has done since she was twelve.    Sarah also loves to dance ballet, modern and hip hop, and to curl up with a good book. She is excited to share her knowledge and experiences with others and to learn from them. Sarah is also enthusiastic about developing her leadership skills and further improve how she approaches her programs and make them more effective for her mentees/students.
