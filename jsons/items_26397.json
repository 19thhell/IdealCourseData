The understanding of the legacy that informs the Scholars Program includes the themes of \u201cthe beloved community\u201d and social justice - Dr. King\u2019s commitment to the proposition that inclusive and just communities are communities where individuals can grow and thrive.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in full-time study and complete their degrees in one of NYU\u2019s undergraduate divisions. In addition, Scholars are awarded a merit and need-based financial aid package and participate in a rich combination of scholarly activities, domestic and international travel colloquia, research, leadership activities including community service, and educational and cultural activities.        Our Story          In 1986, the Association of Black Faculty and Administrators at New York University proposed to the then Chancellor L. Jay Oliva that an all-University honors program be named in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and support his vision of a world free of racism, poverty, violence, and war. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars would not only be among the best and brightest, but they would also be asked to give back in the form of service to others. In 1987, the first group of 16 Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars began their studies in the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education, the Tisch School of the Arts, the Stern School of Business and the Gallatin School. They were from California, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.   Today, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in all undergraduate divisions of the University, hail from coast to coast, and in May 2015 the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program will graduate its 24th Class.

Discussion, debate, outside speakers, social activities, a play that they construct, and a group community service project allow scholars to explore the year\u2019s theme creatively, bringing in issues of leadership development, current events, multiculturalism, social justice, and community. This year\u2019s theme is framed by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s quote, &quot;An individual has not started living until [they] can rise above the narrow confines of [their] individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity&quot; .   Freshman and Sophomore Scholars are expected to maintain a minimum 3.5 GPA and complete 15 hours of community service a semester.        Junior and Senior Years   Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are not required to enroll in Scholars Seminar during Junior and Senior years. They are, however, expected to continue community service and meet the minimum 3.5 GPA.   Scholars in their Junior Year will often spend time completing degree requirements at one of NYU's global sites. The MLK Scholars Program offers support to help defray the cost of study away. Scholars, whose degree program restricts study away during their junior, may receive study away support prior to their junior year.   During the Senior Year, Scholars typically complete internships/fieldwork connected with degree requirements, and may participate in departmental honors and/or honors research.   All MLK Scholars may be invited to participate in University Leadership activities.          Annual Appointment     Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are expected to maintain a 3.5 GPA or better, and to participate actively in program activities as outlined.

The understanding of the legacy that informs the Scholars Program includes the themes of \u201cthe beloved community\u201d and social justice - Dr. King\u2019s commitment to the proposition that inclusive and just communities are communities where individuals can grow and thrive. An all-University honors program, the MLK, Jr. Scholars Program     Promotes excellence in academic achievement and leadership   Builds Community   Helps to prepare and nurture the next generation of leadership for change     The Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program is more than an academic scholarship and requires more of students than outstanding grades. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in full-time study and complete their degrees in one of NYU\u2019s undergraduate divisions. In addition, Scholars are awarded a merit and need-based financial aid package and participate in a rich combination of scholarly activities, domestic and international travel colloquia, research, leadership activities including community service, and educational and cultural activities.        Our Story          In 1986, the Association of Black Faculty and Administrators at New York University proposed to the then Chancellor L. Jay Oliva that an all-University honors program be named in memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and support his vision of a world free of racism, poverty, violence, and war. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars would not only be among the best and brightest, but they would also be asked to give back in the form of service to others. In 1987, the first group of 16 Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars began their studies in the College of Arts and Science, the School of Education, the Tisch School of the Arts, the Stern School of Business and the Gallatin School. They were from California, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas.   Today, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are enrolled in all undergraduate divisions of the University, hail from coast to coast, and in May 2015 the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars Program will graduate its 24th Class.

Discussion, debate, outside speakers, social activities, a play that they construct, and a group community service project allow scholars to explore the year\u2019s theme creatively, bringing in issues of leadership development, current events, multiculturalism, social justice, and community. This year\u2019s theme is framed by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s quote, &quot;An individual has not started living until [they] can rise above the narrow confines of [their] individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity&quot; .   Freshman and Sophomore Scholars are expected to maintain a minimum 3.5 GPA and complete 15 hours of community service a semester.        Junior and Senior Years   Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are not required to enroll in Scholars Seminar during Junior and Senior years. They are, however, expected to continue community service and meet the minimum 3.5 GPA.   Scholars in their Junior Year will often spend time completing degree requirements at one of NYU's global sites. The MLK Scholars Program offers support to help defray the cost of study away. Scholars, whose degree program restricts study away during their junior, may receive study away support prior to their junior year.   During the Senior Year, Scholars typically complete internships/fieldwork connected with degree requirements, and may participate in departmental honors and/or honors research.   All MLK Scholars may be invited to participate in University Leadership activities.          Annual Appointment     Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars are expected to maintain a 3.5 GPA or better, and to participate actively in program activities as outlined.
