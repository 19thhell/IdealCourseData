A block of wood, milk, and air   all have properties. All the material on earth is in three states- solid, liquid,   and gas . The &quot;state&quot; of the matter refers to the group of matter   with the same properties. In other words, you group the objects together according   to their properties.     Solids  The wood block   is solid. A solid has a certain size and shape. The wood   block does not change size or shape. Other examples of solids are the computer,   the desk, and the floor. You can change the shape   of solids. You change the shape of sheets of lumber by sawing it in half or burning   it. From wood    to  How   might you change the shape of a piece of gum?      Liquids  Milk is a liquid.   Milk is liquid matter. It has a size or volume. Volume means it takes up space.   But milk doesn't have a definite shape. It takes the shape of its container.    Liquids can flow, be poured, and spilled. Did you ever spill   juice? Did you notice how the liquid goes everywhere and you have to hurry and   wipe it up? The liquid is taking the shape of the floor and the floor is expansive   limitless boundary (until it hits the wall). You can't spill a wooden block. You   can drop it and it still has the same shape.  What   about jello and peanut butter?  You can spread peanut   butter on bread, but peanut butter does not flow. It is not a liquid at room temperature.   You have to heat peanut butter up to make it a liquid. When you or your mom makes   jello, it is first a liquid. You have to put it in the refrigerator so that it   becomes a solid. These are yummy forms of matter with properties of a liquid and   a solid.     Gases  Run in place very   fast for a minute. Do you notice how hard you are breathing? What you are breathing   is oxygen? You need oxygen to live. That's why you can only hold your breath for   a certain amount of time.  You can't see oxygen. It's   invisible. It is a gas. A gas is matter that has no shape or size of its own.   Gases have no color.  Gases are all around you. You   can feel gas when the wind blows. The wind is moving air. Air is many gases mixed   together.  to Matter Review    Pages and gif animations written and designed by   Sheila M. Estacio.

How does this common material transport heat and sound? And what microscopic changes occur when a glass gains rigidity as it cools?   A team of researchers at NYU\u2019s Center for Soft Matter Research offers a theoretical explanation for these processes in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .   Our understanding of glasses as they change state is relatively limited. This is because, unlike other materials such as metals, their constituent particles--which can be as small as a billionth of a meter in size--are in a disorganized, rather than orderly, arrangement. Understanding what in these disordered arrangements decides if the material is liquid or solid remains a long-lasting challenge of physics and chemistry.   The simplest examples of glasses are colloidal suspensions, which behave essentially as hard spheres. Beyond their conceptual interest, they also matter to scientists because they are the basis for an array of consumer products. For instance, colloidal dispersions comprise such everyday items as paint, milk, gelatin, glass, and porcelain. Moreover, understanding how they evolve from liquids to solids is of concern to medical researchers\u2014for example, the clotting of blood.   Colloids form a liquid at small density, but become solid when the density is increased beyond some threshold. At that point, crowding effects become important: particles are prisoners of the cage formed by their neighbors. Although they can still wiggle somewhat within their cage, they cannot escape far, forbidding flow. Why the assembly of cages can resist the wiggling of particles in the solid phase is a long-standing debate in the field. Explanations have been proposed in very abstract models, but a simple physical picture of what is going on was lacking.   In their theoretical work, spurred by laboratory observations of colloidal glasses, the researchers propose to use 19th-century concepts developed by Maxwell, the founder of electromagnetism, to study the stability of mechanical structures. Thus concepts widely used in architecture and engineering are now applied at a microscopic level in colloidal glasses. Based on these ideas, the authors developed a theory of the emergence of rigidity.   A curious outcome of their work is the prediction that the wiggling motion of particles in their cage is collective: particles dance in a very coordinated way. The structure of the material is predicted to be such that the dance has the largest amplitude it could possibly have without destroying the solid.   The authors show that this coordinated dance is quantitatively affected by the presence of weak spots in the materials. The description leads to various predictions on the dynamics of the particles, as well as the elastic response of the material and the ability to transport heat in molecular glasses.

Abstract: The melting of a solid, like other first-order phase transitions, exhibits an intrinsic time-scale disparity: The time spent by the system in metastable states is orders of magnitude longer than the transition times between the states. Using rare-event sam pling techniques, we find that melting of representative solids\u2014here, copper and aluminum\u2014occurs via multiple, competing pathways involving the formation and migration of point defects or dislocations. Each path is characterized by multiple barrier-crossing events arising from multiple metastable states within the solid basin. At temperatures approaching superheating, melting becomes a single barrier-crossing process, and at the limit of superheating, the melting mechanism is driven by a vibrational instability. Our findings reveal the importance of nonlocal behavior, suggesting a revision of the perspective of classical nucleation theory.
