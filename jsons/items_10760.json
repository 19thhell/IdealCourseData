We will begin with the problem of \"life-having,\" defined both in terms of private property (Lockean possessive individualism) and intersubjective, transhistorical relationality (telepathy, animism, elective affinities). Another topic: the challenge to individual authorship posed by writing collectives and joint or anonymously authored texts (as in, \u201cGuattareuze\u201d or the Italian collective Wu Hung's Manituana). The curatorial techniques of archiving and narrating a free-standing person or singular subject will be examined through its media: papers, photographs, recordings, film and video, testaments, hoarded possessions, bequests, legal obstacles to archival access posed by estate executors. We will analyze cases in which the border between \u201cwork\u201d and \u201clife\u201d is especially blurry. Through a reading of Barthes's seminar on La Pr\u00e9paration du roman, we will consider experiments with biographical form (including recent \"biographies\" of non-real persons [Job], genres [biography of a translation] or cities [Jerusalem]. Other topics may include: conceptual art and literature that deal with fake or what-if biography; the problems faced by archives in-the-making at IMEC, BNF, UC-Irvine, Fales etc. (Foucault, Derrida, Glissant); and finally, the way in which recent critical media theory (Samuel Weber, B\u00e9atrice Jongy) has analyzed posthumous life on internet domains and the transformation of the biographical medium. In their research projects for the course, students will be encouraged to experiment with the practice of critical archiving or new ways of writing biography.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Old Materialisms\u2014Matter and Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d in recent years, it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on continental feminist readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Special Topics in Theory: The Nature of Image  Iampolski This graduate course is designed as a questioning of the nature of the image and its role in human society and culture. We will start with the problem of appearance and expression in animals. In particular, we will use the work of Adolf Portmann and focus on skin and surfaces. We will finish our exploration with modern technologies, screens and interfaces (I am particularly interested in the work of Bill Viola). Two approaches will be explored: the first one is anthropological and the second is a phenomenological approach to image (Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and less know modern phenomenologists). We will use phenomenology to discuss film and newer technologies. The course hopefully will bring to discussion some little known theorists like Gustave Guillaume who claims that language is a spacialization of time and of the unrepresentable, i.e. creation of images. I am also interested in Gilbert Simondon\u2019s little known work on image and imagination. Topics in African Literature: The African Novel Sanders How has the novel evolved in Africa? How have African writers adapted and elaborated this literary form in response to specific African aesthetic, linguistic, ethical and political questions and imperatives? Tracing critical debates on African fiction, we will read classic texts of the post-independence period, by Achebe, Head and others, as well as more recent writing by Kourouma, Diop, and Mpe. Topics in Italian Literature: The Ethics of Pastoral  Tylus &amp; Wofford A team-taught seminar that will focus on some of the critical questions \u2013 aesthetic, ethical, mimetic - generated by pastoral, a literary form that has shown surprising resilience since its \"origins\" in Biblical texts and Theocritus\u2019s Idylls. Among the problems we\u2019ll be puzzling over: to what extent does the poet have the right to speak for the shepherd or peasant \u2013 those who \"cannot represent themselves\"? How does the space of the idyll or pastoral retreat come to mirror the space of literature itself? Why does early modernity engage with pastoral in so many forms \u2013 dramatic, poetic, the novel, painting, etc. \u2013 and what is the lasting legacy of that engagement? The course will also explore the role of the gods in pastoral, from erotic epiphanies to the invisible power of the transcendent. We will ask why the rural gods are so prominent from the earliest periods on in both pastoral poetry and performance. Do the gods lend authority to an alternative stance or social reality, or do they implicitly endorse a traditionalist ideology that sustains the authority of monarch and social order? Other concerns will include the pastoral topics of elegaic loss, erotic lament, the tension between exile and \"otium,\" and the presence of death in the pastoral arcadia. Profs. Wofford and Tylus will move from antiquity (Theocritus, Virgil) to contemporary versions of pastoral (Brokeback Mountain and Jerusalem), with special attention to early modern English, Italian, and Spanish works (Shakespeare, Spenser, Cervantes, Tasso, Andreini, among others). We will also consider the critical tradition that has taken up pastoral as a model for critical and ethical inquiry (William Empson, Harry Berger, John Berger, Gayatri Spivak, Erwin Panofsky, Paul Alpers).  Culture &amp; Critique: Documents and Documentary Modes in Literature, Film and Visual Culture  Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others. This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive, 2)word/image relations, and 3) fiction vs. document. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in an archive of your choice.  Contemporary Critical Theory: Fredric Jameson Zhang   The task of this theory seminar is two-fold: To conduct a close and systematic reading of major works by a leading American theorist and critical thinker of global significance; and to revisit the central questions concerning contemporary theoretical discourse and socio-cultural interpretations through the prism of reading Jameson. In doing so, our interest is to rethink \u201ctheory\u201d against the grain of rhetorical excess and discursive decadence, as a historically defined zone of engagement and, as theory and practice in one, the energetic tip of deep-seated, successive waves of reflection and critique that constitute what is called by Hegel \u201cour times comprehended in thought.\u201d The voluminous corpus by Jameson (so far) is divided into three groups: 1) basic conceptual, methodological work, from The Prison House of Language and Marxism and Form to Valence of Dialectic and Reading Capital, including triumphant methodological demos either in articles (on metacommentary, on cognitive mapping, etc., or in book form (The Political Unconscious); 2) critical interventions in what has come to be a historical study of modernism and modernity, including but not limited to A Singular Modernity, Brecht and Method, and The Modernist Papers; and 3) a systematic interpretation of \u201cthe cultural logic of late capitalism\u201d known as postmodernism, but manifested also in technological, socio-spatial, economic, utopian/ideological, and class-and geo-political terms, all of which are elaborated in Signatures of the Visible, Geopolitical Aesthetics, Postmodernism, The Cultural Turn and Archeology of the Future. At the speed of roughly one book per week, the seminar will be as reading-intensive as discussion-based. The growing body of scholarship on Jameson will be consulted only secondarily in class, but the students will be encouraged to pay attention to how Jameson\u2019s work stands vis-\u00e0-vis other positions within the discursive space of theoretical position-taking (deconstruction, feminism, postcolonialism, to name a few); and to the reception of Jameson in different parts of the world (most notably Asia and Latin America, but increasingly in Europe as well, as indicated by the 2008 Holberg Prize).

Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity Bianchi      In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it  is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific  historical and philosophical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the  Latin \u2018 materia \u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from  Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally,  wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient works on  the origin and constitution of the natural world and its intersections with the  human world, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies  of nature, Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, Greek  atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus , Aristotle\u2019s   Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals , and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence  of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and  gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including  Heidegger, Kristeva, Irigaray, Loraux, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically  engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19 th century conception of Mutterrecht . Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is  advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Topics in Caribbean Literature: Comparatism, Contigency, and the Caribbean Dopico  \u201c The Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has  argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d  What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.

We will begin with the problem of \"life-having,\" defined both in terms of private property (Lockean possessive individualism) and intersubjective, transhistorical relationality (telepathy, animism, elective affinities). Another topic: the challenge to individual authorship posed by writing collectives and joint or anonymously authored texts (as in, \u201cGuattareuze\u201d or the Italian collective Wu Hung's Manituana). The curatorial techniques of archiving and narrating a free-standing person or singular subject will be examined through its media: papers, photographs, recordings, film and video, testaments, hoarded possessions, bequests, legal obstacles to archival access posed by estate executors. We will analyze cases in which the border between \u201cwork\u201d and \u201clife\u201d is especially blurry. Through a reading of Barthes's seminar on La Pr\u00e9paration du roman, we will consider experiments with biographical form (including recent \"biographies\" of non-real persons [Job], genres [biography of a translation] or cities [Jerusalem]. Other topics may include: conceptual art and literature that deal with fake or what-if biography; the problems faced by archives in-the-making at IMEC, BNF, UC-Irvine, Fales etc. (Foucault, Derrida, Glissant); and finally, the way in which recent critical media theory (Samuel Weber, B\u00e9atrice Jongy) has analyzed posthumous life on internet domains and the transformation of the biographical medium. In their research projects for the course, students will be encouraged to experiment with the practice of critical archiving or new ways of writing biography.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Old Materialisms\u2014Matter and Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d in recent years, it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on continental feminist readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Special Topics in Theory: The Nature of Image  Iampolski This graduate course is designed as a questioning of the nature of the image and its role in human society and culture. We will start with the problem of appearance and expression in animals. In particular, we will use the work of Adolf Portmann and focus on skin and surfaces. We will finish our exploration with modern technologies, screens and interfaces (I am particularly interested in the work of Bill Viola). Two approaches will be explored: the first one is anthropological and the second is a phenomenological approach to image (Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and less know modern phenomenologists). We will use phenomenology to discuss film and newer technologies. The course hopefully will bring to discussion some little known theorists like Gustave Guillaume who claims that language is a spacialization of time and of the unrepresentable, i.e. creation of images. I am also interested in Gilbert Simondon\u2019s little known work on image and imagination. Topics in African Literature: The African Novel Sanders How has the novel evolved in Africa? How have African writers adapted and elaborated this literary form in response to specific African aesthetic, linguistic, ethical and political questions and imperatives? Tracing critical debates on African fiction, we will read classic texts of the post-independence period, by Achebe, Head and others, as well as more recent writing by Kourouma, Diop, and Mpe. Topics in Italian Literature: The Ethics of Pastoral  Tylus &amp; Wofford A team-taught seminar that will focus on some of the critical questions \u2013 aesthetic, ethical, mimetic - generated by pastoral, a literary form that has shown surprising resilience since its \"origins\" in Biblical texts and Theocritus\u2019s Idylls. Among the problems we\u2019ll be puzzling over: to what extent does the poet have the right to speak for the shepherd or peasant \u2013 those who \"cannot represent themselves\"? How does the space of the idyll or pastoral retreat come to mirror the space of literature itself? Why does early modernity engage with pastoral in so many forms \u2013 dramatic, poetic, the novel, painting, etc. \u2013 and what is the lasting legacy of that engagement? The course will also explore the role of the gods in pastoral, from erotic epiphanies to the invisible power of the transcendent. We will ask why the rural gods are so prominent from the earliest periods on in both pastoral poetry and performance. Do the gods lend authority to an alternative stance or social reality, or do they implicitly endorse a traditionalist ideology that sustains the authority of monarch and social order? Other concerns will include the pastoral topics of elegaic loss, erotic lament, the tension between exile and \"otium,\" and the presence of death in the pastoral arcadia. Profs. Wofford and Tylus will move from antiquity (Theocritus, Virgil) to contemporary versions of pastoral (Brokeback Mountain and Jerusalem), with special attention to early modern English, Italian, and Spanish works (Shakespeare, Spenser, Cervantes, Tasso, Andreini, among others). We will also consider the critical tradition that has taken up pastoral as a model for critical and ethical inquiry (William Empson, Harry Berger, John Berger, Gayatri Spivak, Erwin Panofsky, Paul Alpers).  Culture &amp; Critique: Documents and Documentary Modes in Literature, Film and Visual Culture  Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others. This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive, 2)word/image relations, and 3) fiction vs. document. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in an archive of your choice.  Contemporary Critical Theory: Fredric Jameson Zhang   The task of this theory seminar is two-fold: To conduct a close and systematic reading of major works by a leading American theorist and critical thinker of global significance; and to revisit the central questions concerning contemporary theoretical discourse and socio-cultural interpretations through the prism of reading Jameson. In doing so, our interest is to rethink \u201ctheory\u201d against the grain of rhetorical excess and discursive decadence, as a historically defined zone of engagement and, as theory and practice in one, the energetic tip of deep-seated, successive waves of reflection and critique that constitute what is called by Hegel \u201cour times comprehended in thought.\u201d The voluminous corpus by Jameson (so far) is divided into three groups: 1) basic conceptual, methodological work, from The Prison House of Language and Marxism and Form to Valence of Dialectic and Reading Capital, including triumphant methodological demos either in articles (on metacommentary, on cognitive mapping, etc., or in book form (The Political Unconscious); 2) critical interventions in what has come to be a historical study of modernism and modernity, including but not limited to A Singular Modernity, Brecht and Method, and The Modernist Papers; and 3) a systematic interpretation of \u201cthe cultural logic of late capitalism\u201d known as postmodernism, but manifested also in technological, socio-spatial, economic, utopian/ideological, and class-and geo-political terms, all of which are elaborated in Signatures of the Visible, Geopolitical Aesthetics, Postmodernism, The Cultural Turn and Archeology of the Future. At the speed of roughly one book per week, the seminar will be as reading-intensive as discussion-based. The growing body of scholarship on Jameson will be consulted only secondarily in class, but the students will be encouraged to pay attention to how Jameson\u2019s work stands vis-\u00e0-vis other positions within the discursive space of theoretical position-taking (deconstruction, feminism, postcolonialism, to name a few); and to the reception of Jameson in different parts of the world (most notably Asia and Latin America, but increasingly in Europe as well, as indicated by the 2008 Holberg Prize).

And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.

We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity  Bianchi This is the first part of a two-course sequence on the history of materialisms in Western philosophy and literature. The second will be taught by Jacques Lezra in Spring 2014. Each class may be taken independently. In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific historical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the Latin \u2018materia\u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally, wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient texts, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies of nature, Greek atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals, and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including those of Kristeva, Irigaray, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19th century conception of Mutterrecht. Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation.  Topics in Black Literature: Fanon &amp; Glissant as Post Negritude Thinkers  Diawara The idea is to take the 1956 Congress of Black Writers and Artists, organized by Presence Africaine in Paris (at the Sorbonne), as a seminal moment, not only for the theories of decolonization, but also for ways of imagining Black and African modernities beyond Negritude. For the first time at this, writers, writers were proposing alternative ideas--Metissage, creolization and national culture--instead of the all encompassing theory of Negritude and its variances of Africanism. The course will first focus on the significance of this Congress to what we call Black Cultural Studies, today, and then attempt to situate and read the texts of Fanon and Glissant in relation to Senghor and Cesaire.  Special Topics in Theory: Edward Said, Comparative Genealogies, and Intellectual Practice Dopico Ten years after his death, we reflect on the intellectual and political legacies, the critical genealogies, and the web of affiliations and interlocutors that Edward Said inscribed for comparative literature. We consider his works from Beginnings on and engage alongside his texts those of his chief influences and interlocutors, including Vico, Gramsci, Arendt, Auerbach, de Man, Derrida, Foucault, Williams and Hall. We will think about his work, his negotiations with various genealogies and intellectual formations, and his role in redefining disciplinary boundaries, historical disciplines like comparatism and emergent fields like postcolonial studies. We will think about his practices as an academic and public intellectual, consider how Said reflected on genre, medium, vocation, and worldliness, and how the essay served as the paradigmatic heuristic practice for his critical engagements.  Culture and Critique: Transnational America   Garcia This seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical junctures and devote special attention to re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. We examine longstanding varieties of comparative cultural studies, including theories of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the planetary. Among our recurrent themes will be the anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual cultures. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, Claude McKay, Sherwood Anderson, Nella Larsen, and Jean Toomer, we consider the implications of recent social theory (Spivak, Laclau, Zizek, among others) for twenty-first century comparative American studies.  Discourse and Society: Third Worldism: Bandung, Afro-Asianness, Non-Alignment, &amp; the Middle East  Halim This course addresses a series of overlapping Third-Worldist internationalist movements starting from Bandung (1955) with a focus on the Middle East. Through theoretical texts, journals of the period, and conference statements, accompanied by some literary texts, we will interrogate the prehistory of postcolonial theory, which is generally dated to the publication in 1978 of Edward W. Said\u2019s Orientalism and ask what political purchase may still attach to the term \u201cThird World,\u201d for example in the Arab Spring. Readings by, among others, Anouar Abdel Malek; Aijaz Ahmad; Samir Amin; Mohamed El-Bisatie; Rachid al-Daif; Arif Dirlik; Frantz Fanon; Amitav Ghosh; Alex LaGuma; Roel Meijer; Kwame Nkrumah; Edward Said; Helmy Sharawy; Richard Wright; and Robert Young.  Literature, History, and Politics: Comparative Internationalisms  Ross Internationalism is a central political and cultural force of the modern era. Yet unlike the vast literature on empire and nationalism, the study of radical internationalism has been comparatively meager. This seminar will study the cultural politics of late 19th century Europe in the wake of the Paris Commune of 1871, paying particular attention to the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Kropotkin\u2019s political theory, the multifarious writing and activities of William Morris, as well as other figures including Elisee Reclus and Paul Lafargue. Topics to include internationalism, anti-productivism, anarchism.   Contemporary Critical Theories: Freud\u2019s Case Histories  Sanders Psychoanalysis has played a crucial part in the evolution of the critical theories that inform our practice in literary studies. From the efforts of the Frankfurt School to come to terms with the terrifying conjuncture represented by the rise of Fascism in Europe, to the emergence of postcolonial critique in Frantz Fanon and others, to deconstruction, and feminist and queer theory, psychoanalysis has been widely appropriated\u2014often critically, but almost always productively. In this seminar, we shall immerse ourselves in what are the key classical demonstrations of the setting to work of psychoanalysis\u2014namely, Freud\u2019s major case histories: from the Studies on Hysteria, to the cases of Dora, Little Hans, the Rat Man, Senatspr\u00e4sident Schreber, and the Wolf Man. Attention will also be devoted to Freud\u2019s papers on technique. In order to link Freud\u2019s texts to more recent developments in theory and cultural studies, we shall be considering them through the lens of the commentaries devoted to them by Jacques Lacan, as well as important subsequent interventions by Jacqueline Rose, Juliet Mitchell, Nicolas Abraham &amp; Maria Torok, Jacques Derrida, Friedrich Kittler, Avital Ronell, and Eric Santner.
