As a performance artist and photographer, I created artistic pieces using the waters of Venice since it is a place of shifting light, mists, and hazes that change as the sun rises.          The seminar, The Artist in Venice, led by Professor William Barcham, gave me the opportunity to view Renaissance paintings throughout Venice. Three mornings a week, we met our professor at different locations, churches, and monuments. It was an adventure finding your way on the water buses through the canals and lagoons of the city. On other mornings, we would work on our personal projects in the Graduate Studio Critique classes. Some would paint, others would practice photography. I would spend my mornings photographing the fishing villages or creating performance pieces on the beaches of the Lido when the light was absolutely beautiful! During the afternoons and early evenings, we participated in artist talks. We would listen to various artists from Italy and view their work. As an artist, this dialogue with other artists and my experiences pursuing my own artwork in another country opened my life to another perspective. So often in America, we think everything is about us and the way we live. I learned that the world is far more complex, that there are other ways of seeing art and indeed the rest of the world. All of this has contributed to my larger world view. I hope I can continue to add to that new global perspective.          Looking for a more personal experience of Venice, I took a boat out to one of the islands of Venice called Burano. I had never seen so much color on an island before. It was a small fisherman's village filled with amazing doorways, alleys, and windows. I had the luxury of my own time that allowed me to view a more personal relationship with the people and islands of Venice where civilizations have lived for centuries. As a student of art, I was most affected by the vivid colors of the places and the strong sense of art history around me. The cobblestone alleys I walked upon reminded me of the centuries of lives I must be passing. A new window had opened to me and as a photographer, I sought to capture time. I enrolled in the Venice Program because I wanted an international experience around art. I also wanted to participate in a global art cooperative. I felt I needed to learn more by living in Europe. And indeed, I learned a lot more than I expected. As a performance artist and photographer, art history and foreign travel are not required in my degree program, but I felt I was missing something. Art history is the foundation of all art. If I learned something about it, then maybe it would improve the way I practice and see art in the world.          Looking for a gondola ride? I had always wanted to take one. It was the first thing that I did when I visited Venice. The accordian music that accompanied the ride added to the journey through small canal streets between buildings. It was the first time I realized that I could really do without my car!          Strolling through the streets and labyrinths of Venice on the way to classes gave us the opportunity to meet local people and observe their way of life. Speaking to them, I learned to improve my Italian. Their friendly faces welcomed me in their country. I soon felt at home. In undergraduate school, I had a chance to live in Spain. I have never forgotten the experience or the people. To this day, I still write to the many friends I had met. Now, visiting Italy as a graduate student, I appreciate things much more. I have met such wonderful people and had a wonderful experience. It is my hope that as an artist I will be able to partner better with people around the world and participate in international exhibitions. My career goal is to become an international artist. I think that is the way life is going now. It is more than America. It is about the world and how we fit into it to make it a better place. And hopefully, a place where I can exhibit and share my art with others!                       This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.

He is most interested in the ways that technical and scientific expertise helped individuals and institutions make sense of the connections between society and nature. He has written about forest and water management in Renaissance Venice, and is currently working on a history of veterinary medicine in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Italy, which examines the connection between widespread zoonotic diseases (especially bovine diseases), changes in the Italian diet, and the establishment of veterinary medicine as an academic discipline at the University of Padua. He is also writing a general environmental history of early modern Europe.     His book, A Forest on the Sea won the American Historical Association\u2019s Herbert Baxter Adams Prize for best first book in European history, as well as the Weyerhaeuser Prize for best book in conservation history and the Delmas Prize for best book in Venetian studies.

As a performance artist and photographer, I created artistic pieces using the waters of Venice since it is a place of shifting light, mists, and hazes that change as the sun rises.          The seminar, The Artist in Venice, led by Professor William Barcham, gave me the opportunity to view Renaissance paintings throughout Venice. Three mornings a week, we met our professor at different locations, churches, and monuments. It was an adventure finding your way on the water buses through the canals and lagoons of the city. On other mornings, we would work on our personal projects in the Graduate Studio Critique classes. Some would paint, others would practice photography. I would spend my mornings photographing the fishing villages or creating performance pieces on the beaches of the Lido when the light was absolutely beautiful! During the afternoons and early evenings, we participated in artist talks. We would listen to various artists from Italy and view their work. As an artist, this dialogue with other artists and my experiences pursuing my own artwork in another country opened my life to another perspective. So often in America, we think everything is about us and the way we live. I learned that the world is far more complex, that there are other ways of seeing art and indeed the rest of the world. All of this has contributed to my larger world view. I hope I can continue to add to that new global perspective.          Looking for a more personal experience of Venice, I took a boat out to one of the islands of Venice called Burano. I had never seen so much color on an island before. It was a small fisherman's village filled with amazing doorways, alleys, and windows. I had the luxury of my own time that allowed me to view a more personal relationship with the people and islands of Venice where civilizations have lived for centuries. As a student of art, I was most affected by the vivid colors of the places and the strong sense of art history around me. The cobblestone alleys I walked upon reminded me of the centuries of lives I must be passing. A new window had opened to me and as a photographer, I sought to capture time. I enrolled in the Venice Program because I wanted an international experience around art. I also wanted to participate in a global art cooperative. I felt I needed to learn more by living in Europe. And indeed, I learned a lot more than I expected. As a performance artist and photographer, art history and foreign travel are not required in my degree program, but I felt I was missing something. Art history is the foundation of all art. If I learned something about it, then maybe it would improve the way I practice and see art in the world.          Looking for a gondola ride? I had always wanted to take one. It was the first thing that I did when I visited Venice. The accordian music that accompanied the ride added to the journey through small canal streets between buildings. It was the first time I realized that I could really do without my car!          Strolling through the streets and labyrinths of Venice on the way to classes gave us the opportunity to meet local people and observe their way of life. Speaking to them, I learned to improve my Italian. Their friendly faces welcomed me in their country. I soon felt at home. In undergraduate school, I had a chance to live in Spain. I have never forgotten the experience or the people. To this day, I still write to the many friends I had met. Now, visiting Italy as a graduate student, I appreciate things much more. I have met such wonderful people and had a wonderful experience. It is my hope that as an artist I will be able to partner better with people around the world and participate in international exhibitions. My career goal is to become an international artist. I think that is the way life is going now. It is more than America. It is about the world and how we fit into it to make it a better place. And hopefully, a place where I can exhibit and share my art with others!                       This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.

He concentrates his interests on the presence of the Sogdians and the Persians in Xinjiang and proper China in the pre-Islamic period. He took part in the Italian-Uzbek excavations in the region of Bukhara directed by Prof. Chiara Silvi Antonini from Rome University \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d in fall 2002 and, in fall 2006, he was invited by the research team directed by Prof. Maurizio Tosi from Bologna University \u201cAlma Mater\u201d to visit their excavations in Samarkand. The result of this fieldwork was the publication of a book (2009) on the identification of a cycle of paintings in pre-Islamic Samarkand (Afrasyab) where important Chinese (and, possibly, Indian) elements are depicted as well. Moreover, the Afrasyab paintings could be considered an ideal link between the decorations of the 6 th century funerary monuments from Xi\u2019an and the Islamic production of book illustrations, specifically the banquet scenes or, in any case, the representations of the royal court.    His scholarly interests range widely, from the archaeology and history of art of Iranian peoples such as the Sasanian Persians and Sogdians to the archaeology and history of art of the pre-Tang and Tang periods with special attention devoted to the presence of external elements (mainly Iranian ones) in 6 th -7 th century Chinese art.    The extraordinary discoveries in the area around Xi\u2018an, the ancient Chinese imperial capital, of a series of newly excavated graves which belonged to Iranian immigrants settled into China during the 6 th century became one of his main interests. In fact, these funerary monuments allow us to better understand the history and culture of Sogdiana motherland and also its largely unknown local form of Zoroastrianism.    While at ISAW, he will be completing a study devoted to the representation of the Senmurv (Neo-Persian Simurgh ) in Iranian arts during pre-Islamic and Islamic periods. This is a mythological fantastic bird much celebrated in Zoroastrian literary sources (a kind of \u201cPersian phoenix\u201d) whose investigation should be reconsidered in the light of new archaeological discoveries in Persia and Central Asia.
