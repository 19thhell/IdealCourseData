The Mindfulness Initiative is a joint collaboration between Counseling and Wellness Services and the Wellness Exchange . This initiative was founded on the belief that mindfulness, the simple act of being aware of one's experience in the present moment, can be transformative to the NYU community. The practice of mindfulness promotes good health of mind, body and spirit by helping members of the community cope with the many challenges of academic life and make choices that aid in living life to the fullest. The mission of the Mindfulness Initiative is to integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the Student Health Center, promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. The Initiative emphasizes a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions.

The Mindfulness Initiative is a joint collaboration between Counseling and Wellness Services and the Wellness Exchange . This initiative was founded on the belief that mindfulness, the simple act of being aware of one's experience in the present moment, can be transformative to the NYU community. The practice of mindfulness promotes good health of mind, body and spirit by helping members of the community cope with the many challenges of academic life and make choices that aid in living life to the fullest. The mission of the Mindfulness Initiative is to integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the Student Health Center, promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. The Initiative emphasizes a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions.
