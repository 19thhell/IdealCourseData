Also mentioned above, during the first year, the student must secure a faculty mentor from within the department who has formally agreed to supervise the thesis research or independent project. Upon approval by the Biomaterials and Biomimetics Department Chairman, a Co-mentor from another department in the University may be assigned to advise the student.   Thesis research protocol.&amp;nbsp;The thesis proposal (protocol) for the completion of original research must be: (1) approved by the mentor and the Department Chair, (2) filed with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Laboratory Manager, and (3) presented and approved at a department research meeting. The student must have received a grade of P in the Introduction to Research in Biomaterials course.   The plan of study and the thesis research are formulated in consultation with the faculty mentor(s). The thesis must represent original, independent research in a significant area of biomaterials and biomimetics at a level comparable to research published in recognized journals or as professional monographs. When the thesis is completed and has been approved by the mentor(s) and by a research advisory committee (readers) assigned by the Director of Graduate Studies, the candidate defends the results of the research before a faculty committee. No more than twelve months should lapse between the approved proposal and the thesis defense. Exceptions requiring time extension must be approved by the Chair of the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics or program director.   Non-thesis option. The nature of the independent project in Biomaterials must be developed in consultation with a faculty mentor and approved by the director of graduate studies.

Introduction to Research (BIOM-DN 2001)                               [2 points. Course Director: D. Mijares].This course offers much of the necessary information for conduct thesis research and preparing the Masters thesis. It includes how to prepare scientific abstracts, papers, and presentations, use of reference databases, and also includes information on the different research program and topics that are actively being studied by department faculty.                                                              Imaging Science (BIOM-DN 1016)                               [4 points. Course Director: T. Bromage,]. This course will highlight basic principles of preparation and imaging relevant to biomaterials research, particularly as they relate to 2D and 3D transmitted and reflected light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy of bone and tooth microanatomy. Each student will have the opportunity to work with samples, the purpose being to integrate preparation methods for some specific imaging mode(s). Students will also be exposed to and perform digital processing, analysis, and measurements of images acquired from their prepared samples.                                                              Complex Material Systems (BIOMA-DN 1017)                               [3 credits. Course Director: Y. Zhang] Many structural and biomedical components encounter service conditions that require materials performance to vary with location within the component. Conventional design using monolithic materials often fail to meet the application demands. This course offers graduate students a comprehensive study of structure-function-property relationships in composites across a range of applications. A background in composite materials design is provided, including multiphase metal, ceramic and polymer systems. This background is supplemented by study of the interactions between micro, meso and macro structures within several biological structures as a basis for biomimetic materials design. A number of lecturers from a broad range of disciplines give presentations in this integrated course.                                                              Independent Project in Biomaterials (BIOM-DN 3001)                               [2 credits. Course Directors: Faculty]This course requires an independent project that can be a thorough review of an advanced literature topic, evidenced based review, or researched subject resulting in manuscript or presentation on a topic previously accepted by the department.

It is anticipated that the student will complete most of the course requirement in the first academic year and the research requirements in the second year.     First Semester: Begin coursework. Begin selection process for thesis research project as well as mentor and committee selection.   Second Semester: At this time the mentor and committee should be selected and a preliminary proposal should be prepared. By mid semester these steps should be complete. By the end of this semester the student should have submitted their first draft of a thesis proposal.   Third Semester: By the beginning of the third semester of graduate study, the student should have an approved thesis proposal or independent project and be starting their writing. The student should also begin writing the final dissertation. The bulk of the thesis work and data acquisition should be conducted during this semester.   Fourth Semester: Work in the fourth semester should revolve around completion of thesis research, writing of the final dissertation, and completion of the Master\u2019s Degree Checklist. At the middle of this semester arrangements should be made for submission of the final dissertation and arrangement of the thesis defense date. By the end of the semester, all thesis requirements should be completed so the student can graduate.                       apply online now Read More                                                                     Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}, {"content": "Biomaterials                                                                                                     NYU.edu requires JavaScript be enabled in your browser in order to use important features of the site.

The mission of the program is to provide education and training in biomaterials science and immersion in state-of the art technology, while ultimately contributing to improving human health through biomaterials-based treatment modalities.   The goals of this program are to:     Provide students with state-of-the-art knowledge and training in biomaterials science that will prepare them for careers in research and development in academia and industry   Enhance the students' understanding of biomaterials-based treatment modalities by providing them with a broad background in biomaterials structure, fabrication, function and interactions with cells and tissues   Serve as a basis for further advanced studies, e.g. Ph.D. programs in biology, physical and health sciences   Provide clinicians with the knowledge for materials selection and application     The department is located at the New York University College of Dentistry, a world-class craniofacial research and healthcare institution, and the largest dental school in the world. The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics is uniquely positioned to build upon its existing strengths in biomaterials fabrication, characterization, and testing to achieve the goal of the program and to bridge the gap between bench top research and clinical application. The Department will be moving to a new state-of-the-art facility in the new Nursing, Dentistry, and Biomedical Engineering Building located on First Avenue and 26th Street, to be completed in January 2015.   Overview of the Program   The program includes the study of basic material properties and structure of a full range of biomaterials used in medicine and dentistry. The biologic interactions of these materials related to their composition, surface, architectural features and function; and the methods employed to investigate structure, function, and biologic interactions are presented and explored.   Two degree options are available to the student dependent on their scholastic requirements.                                                  Thesis option                               The program represents a challenge to students in managing course work while designing and completing a thesis research project. Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science requires 36 credit hours of course work as well as completion and acceptance of a research thesis based on the student\u2019s original work. Of the 36 required credit hours, 2-6 credit hours may be approved for the student\u2019s research work. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation and the uncertainties of research. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). The research for the thesis will overlap with the didactic program. A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3 years. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN.4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop a research protocol. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the research can commence. Students are free to propose their own research topic but final project selection must be approved by the faculty mentor and department. Constraints regarding feasibility, time, cost to the department, safety and regulatory issues, availability of materials, access to fabrication and investigation facilities, and mentor interest are all factors in project selection. The department will try to provide alternatives that are satisfactory to the student.                                                              Non-thesis option                               In lieu of a thesis the student will be required to conduct an Independent Project in Biomaterials.   Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science, non-thesis option, requires 40 credit hours of course work, 2 credit hours will be utilized for the student\u2019s independent project. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years.   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3.5 years. A student who is enrolled in an International Clinical program can take 5-8 credits in our program, and still complete both programs in two years if they are motivated to do so. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN 4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop an independent project. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the project can commence.

However, in any case, continuous matriculation is required.                                                              Requirements for the First Year                               Research Methods and Principles of Biomaterials Science. All beginning graduate students are required to register in their first Fall semester for BIOM-DN 2001, \u201cIntroduction to Research\u201d (2 credits), and BIOM-DN 1000, \u201cPrinciples of Biomaterials Science\u201d (3 credits). For Introduction to Research there are two requirements for obtaining a grade of P (Pass) on this course: (1) Satisfactory attendance and participation in the course and (2) Submission of a research protocol (not necessarily the thesis protocol).   Also mentioned above, during the first year, the student must secure a faculty mentor from within the department who has formally agreed to supervise the thesis research or independent project. Upon approval by the Biomaterials and Biomimetics Department Chairman, a Co-mentor from another department in the University may be assigned to advise the student.   Thesis research protocol.&amp;nbsp;The thesis proposal (protocol) for the completion of original research must be: (1) approved by the mentor and the Department Chair, (2) filed with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Laboratory Manager, and (3) presented and approved at a department research meeting. The student must have received a grade of P in the Introduction to Research in Biomaterials course.   The plan of study and the thesis research are formulated in consultation with the faculty mentor(s). The thesis must represent original, independent research in a significant area of biomaterials and biomimetics at a level comparable to research published in recognized journals or as professional monographs. When the thesis is completed and has been approved by the mentor(s) and by a research advisory committee (readers) assigned by the Director of Graduate Studies, the candidate defends the results of the research before a faculty committee. No more than twelve months should lapse between the approved proposal and the thesis defense. Exceptions requiring time extension must be approved by the Chair of the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics or program director.   Non-thesis option. The nature of the independent project in Biomaterials must be developed in consultation with a faculty mentor and approved by the director of graduate studies.                                                              Special Program                               Special Program Emphasis may be arranged by the Department Chair or program director for students desiring to participate in a Special Emphasis research study (e.g. concentration in another department of the University, but still related to Biomaterials and Biomimetics (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.). Students working with a Special Program Emphasis may, in consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies, be required to take courses in addition to the 36 points mentioned above.                                                              Departmental Meetings and Seminars                               Mandatory attendance is required of all graduate students to periodic departmental seminars and/or research group meetings and various sessions of Laboratory Safety (see section \u201cRequirements for Participation in Research\u201d). At these seminars and research group meetings, students, faculty and scholars from other institutions discuss their research plans and findings. In addition, the department may co-sponsor special seminars throughout the year for which attendance is also mandatory unless specifically excused by the Director of Graduate Studies.

This course will highlight basic principles of preparation and imaging relevant to biomaterials research, particularly as they relate to 2D and 3D transmitted and reflected light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy of bone and tooth microanatomy. Each student will have the opportunity to work with samples, the purpose being to integrate preparation methods for some specific imaging mode(s). Students will also be exposed to and perform digital processing, analysis, and measurements of images acquired from their prepared samples.                                                              Complex Material Systems (BIOMA-DN 1017)                               [3 credits. Course Director: Y. Zhang] Many structural and biomedical components encounter service conditions that require materials performance to vary with location within the component. Conventional design using monolithic materials often fail to meet the application demands. This course offers graduate students a comprehensive study of structure-function-property relationships in composites across a range of applications. A background in composite materials design is provided, including multiphase metal, ceramic and polymer systems. This background is supplemented by study of the interactions between micro, meso and macro structures within several biological structures as a basis for biomimetic materials design. A number of lecturers from a broad range of disciplines give presentations in this integrated course.

It is anticipated that the student will complete most of the course requirement in the first academic year and the research requirements in the second year.     First Semester: Begin coursework. Begin selection process for thesis research project as well as mentor and committee selection.   Second Semester: At this time the mentor and committee should be selected and a preliminary proposal should be prepared. By mid semester these steps should be complete. By the end of this semester the student should have submitted their first draft of a thesis proposal.   Third Semester: By the beginning of the third semester of graduate study, the student should have an approved thesis proposal or independent project and be starting their writing. The student should also begin writing the final dissertation. The bulk of the thesis work and data acquisition should be conducted during this semester.   Fourth Semester: Work in the fourth semester should revolve around completion of thesis research, writing of the final dissertation, and completion of the Master\u2019s Degree Checklist. At the middle of this semester arrangements should be made for submission of the final dissertation and arrangement of the thesis defense date. By the end of the semester, all thesis requirements should be completed so the student can graduate.                       apply online now Read More                                                                     Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}, {"content": "Biomaterials                                                                                                     NYU.edu requires JavaScript be enabled in your browser in order to use important features of the site.

The mission of the program is to provide education and training in biomaterials science and immersion in state-of the art technology, while ultimately contributing to improving human health through biomaterials-based treatment modalities.   The goals of this program are to:     Provide students with state-of-the-art knowledge and training in biomaterials science that will prepare them for careers in research and development in academia and industry   Enhance the students' understanding of biomaterials-based treatment modalities by providing them with a broad background in biomaterials structure, fabrication, function and interactions with cells and tissues   Serve as a basis for further advanced studies, e.g. Ph.D. programs in biology, physical and health sciences   Provide clinicians with the knowledge for materials selection and application     The department is located at the New York University College of Dentistry, a world-class craniofacial research and healthcare institution, and the largest dental school in the world. The Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics is uniquely positioned to build upon its existing strengths in biomaterials fabrication, characterization, and testing to achieve the goal of the program and to bridge the gap between bench top research and clinical application. The Department will be moving to a new state-of-the-art facility in the new Nursing, Dentistry, and Biomedical Engineering Building located on First Avenue and 26th Street, to be completed in January 2015.   Overview of the Program   The program includes the study of basic material properties and structure of a full range of biomaterials used in medicine and dentistry. The biologic interactions of these materials related to their composition, surface, architectural features and function; and the methods employed to investigate structure, function, and biologic interactions are presented and explored.   Two degree options are available to the student dependent on their scholastic requirements.                                                  Thesis option                               The program represents a challenge to students in managing course work while designing and completing a thesis research project. Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science requires 36 credit hours of course work as well as completion and acceptance of a research thesis based on the student\u2019s original work. Of the 36 required credit hours, 2-6 credit hours may be approved for the student\u2019s research work. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation and the uncertainties of research. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). The research for the thesis will overlap with the didactic program. A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3 years. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN.4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop a research protocol. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the research can commence. Students are free to propose their own research topic but final project selection must be approved by the faculty mentor and department. Constraints regarding feasibility, time, cost to the department, safety and regulatory issues, availability of materials, access to fabrication and investigation facilities, and mentor interest are all factors in project selection. The department will try to provide alternatives that are satisfactory to the student.                                                              Non-thesis option                               In lieu of a thesis the student will be required to conduct an Independent Project in Biomaterials.   Completion of the M.S. program in Biomaterials Science, non-thesis option, requires 40 credit hours of course work, 2 credit hours will be utilized for the student\u2019s independent project. The time required to complete the program is not specified and will vary as it is affected by time commitment, motivation. Most of the didactic portion of the program for full time students can be completed over approximately two regular semesters (one academic year). A full time student can complete the program, including research, in approximately two academic years.   A part time student is encouraged to register for 6 credits a semester and could complete the program in approximately 3.5 years. A student who is enrolled in an International Clinical program can take 5-8 credits in our program, and still complete both programs in two years if they are motivated to do so. Students must be in continuous enrollment during the period of their participation in the program, either by course registration or by the maintenance of matriculation registration (BIOM-DN 4747). All requirements must be satisfied within a period of 5 years from the time of original registration for courses.   The student is responsible for the selection of a mentor and for working with that mentor to develop an independent project. The protocol must be presented to the faculty for approval before the project can commence.
