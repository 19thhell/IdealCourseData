FALL 2014 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Moloney (Music)  s yllabus Drawing from selected studies and recordings of music in a variety of world cultures and a semester-long series of live in-class performances by, and interviews with, some of the world's greatest musicians, we examine the complex roles that music plays in day-to-day life. We explore the ways in which music is learned, composed, performed, admired, critiqued, used, and consumed, and look at the multi-faceted relationships between music and music making and race, gender, sexual preference, class, and regional and national identities. Close attention is paid to the ways in which different kinds of music can function as crucial identity markers, particularly in times of great social change and population movements. We consider the ways we 'hear' music in multiple social situations, such as individual and community rituals, and performance events, such as concerts and festivals, and we also look at how music is 'used' in media forms such as film and television and, more generally, as a commodity in the world market place. We study the increasingly complex ways all of us 'consume' or enjoy music in multiple modalities, from street music to radio, CD players and iPods, and downloading from internet sites. In our journey we familiarize ourselves with and interrogate terms like 'musicality', 'musical literacy', 'musical language', 'orality', 'aurality', and various other analytical and descriptive constructs that have been used in discussions on music and society. Most of all, we try to learn not to take music for granted but to be mindful, appreciative, and questioning of the various ways it touches, and can enrich, our lives.

Are they circumstantial? Some musical practices seem, at least at first sight, non-technological; others are overtly technological and use screens, speakers, computers, and other gadgets, as central aspects of their music. Focusing on experimental electronic and computer music and a diverse range of popular music produced in the 20th and 21st Century, we ask: What is music? What is sound? What is noise? What is music technology? Is music inherently technological? Is technology expressive? FALL 2014 CORE-UA 740, Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics &amp; the Aquila Theatre)  syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary America--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability.

Our screenings explore a range of films from from \u2018sci fi\u2019 to fantasy and horror, extending from the 1950s to the present, and far into the future. We explore varied questions and issues including the increasing prevalence of apocalyptic endings to present and future worlds; contrasts between a fragile democratic \u2018now\u2019 vs. an authoritarian techno-future; race, gender, and sexuality in the \u2018scientifically\u2019 engineered and overdetermined future; class, labor and social privilege among replicants, cyborgs, and humans; the consumption of virtual reality, cyber-sex, and other commodities; post-technological tribalism; future \u2018hoods and cityscapes; warnings of cyber-surveillance, techno-collapse, and eco-disaster.

Before the twentieth century, the cultural and artistic life of the Indian subcontinent was primarily supported by rulers in various regional centers. During the period, paintings on paper filled several important roles. They fused the indigenous tradition of devotional imagery with new, primarily secular functions. In the Indian cultural tradition paintings provide visual metaphors for various moods, seasons, times of day and concepts. They celebrate the lives and accomplishments of individual rulers through the medium of narrative pictures and portraits. They also recall the lives and personalities of gods and heroes. The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds an important collection of Indian paintings and during the spring of 2015 is hosting a major loan exhibition devoted to Indian art, creating a unique opportunity for students to encounter these works.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Dang (Music)  syllabus The art of listening through close study of musical performances from a wide range of cultures and places, from Kaluli song to Corsican polyphony, from Cuban rumba to Aboriginal rock. We explore the sensory details of musical sounds, the cultural and historical encounters informing those sounds, and their contemporary circulation in the global marketplace. Through our varied musical excursions, we raise questions about homelands, heritage, and belonging; about the diverse genres of music-making, from mimicry of nature to multi-track remixes, song, dance, and drumming; about music\u2019s role in articulating the individual\u2019s relationship to society, the environment, and the metaphysical world; about language, authenticity, and hybridity; and finally, about the complicated politics of global exchange that influence musical production and consumption. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus   Explores the unsettling ability of science fiction and horror movies, or combinations thereof, to depict society\u2019s range of repressed, charged and subversive issues. Many of these films represent a variety of socially constructed identities and differences in their nightmare narratives, monsters and fantastic settings. Covering a roughly historical trajectory of popular horror and sci-fi flicks, we ponder how they engage difference in various social expressions from race, childhood, gender, to ideology, class, and imagined, confabulated representations of the body, including \u2018the post-human condition.\u2019 Readings draw on a number of relevant critical insights and discourses, from psychoanalysis to cultural and class analysis, queer theory, futureology and beyond. Films include Picture of Dorian Gray, Gattica, The Hunger, J.D.\u2019s Revenge, Children of the Corn, Solaris, Forbidden Planet.

Italy was above all the home of opera, and we explore both the economic side of the \u201copera industry\u201d and the most important works of the peninsula\u2019s greatest composers of the day: Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Puccini, and above all Giuseppe Verdi, the most dominant artistic figure in 19th century Italy. We follow Verdi\u2019s stylistic development from the \u201cgalley years\u201d of the 1840\u2019s through the late masterpieces as well as examine the impact of Italian politics on his operas. We also read works of literature by Stendhal, di Lampedusa, Svevo, and Pirandello, and conclude with Martinetti, Boccioni, and the futurist movement in the visual arts and the relationship of these and other artists to fascism.

FALL 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Crow (Institute of Fine Arts)  syllabus The Pop Revolution in Art, Music, and Design. In a burst of change that resonated across the world, the early 1960s witnessed the arrival of Pop Art. At first concentrated in the studios and galleries of lower Manhattan, its commercialized imagery and eye-catching colors soon made their appearance across the globe, providing the signature visual accompaniment for this notorious decade of youthful experimentation and dissent. The fierce resistance encountered by early Pop artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol demonstrated how severely Pop had challenged and shaken the existing hierarchy of culture. A high seriousness and need for profundity had typified fine art, qualities deemed antithetical to the everyday pastimes and seductions of popular culture. That such motifs were invading galleries and museums signified the collapse of that exclusivity under the weight of unrealizable aspirations. This newly accepting outlook on the artifacts and images of everyday life, however, was not as new as it appeared. In London, artists, designers, and dissident intellectuals had shown the way from the early 1950s. Similarly and much earlier in downtown Manhattan, sophisticated revivals of American folk art and music had brought popular expression to the fore as a counterweight to high-minded artistic imports from Europe. As the idea of a Pop Art had been drawn from a wider world, so its innovations of the early 1960s soon migrated to the international counterculture. Young, non-conformist designers, musicians, and filmmakers applied that same artistic self-consciousness to their own endeavors. And these waves persist into the present day.

We encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case studies we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.

FALL 2015 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) Hollywood 1939. For critics and fans, 1939 is a year that crystallized the cultural and even artistic potential of the Hollywood studio system. This, after all, was the year of such revered works as Gone With the Wind, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights, Stagecoach, and The Wizard of Oz. Intending to avoid any notion of special genius or historical accident, we set out to account for Hollywood's achievements in concrete cultural terms: What was the Hollywood system and what sorts of films did it produce and how and to what effect? Topics include studio structure and its operations, institutional support and pressure (such as the role of censorship and regulation), the role of critics, audience taste.

China may boast a civilization several thousand years old, but we did not know much about the images produced at its early stages until fairly recently in the twentieth century. The discovery of over 8,000 life-size terracotta warriors near the mausoleum of the first emperor surprised and dazzled the world. How did ancient Chinese artisans create and mass-produce those vivid terracotta warriors? Such a visual wonder could not burst into existence without prior experiments in aesthetics and technology, just as the ideas and skills embedded in it made an impact on later artistic developments. Drawing on the excellent Asian art collections in New York museums, we explore art and design in ancient China through selected masterpieces in decorated pottery, engraved jade objects, cast bronze vessels, sculpture, architecture, and painting, paying attention to how artisans overcame the limits of various materials with their hands and imagination, as well as the cultural contexts in which those masterpieces were situated.

Why do performers perform? (and what difference does that performance make?) We consider a wide range of performances\u2014on the stage, page, screen, and street\u2014in order to explore these questions, focusing on performance as a form of cultural expression, as a site of cultural change, and as a building block for \u201cculture\u201d itself.  SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus* We   screen, read and discuss a range of utopian/dystopian visions of the   future as forecast in our popular cinema, and literature. Our screenings   explore a range of films from from \u2018sci fi\u2019 to fantasy and horror,   extending from the 1950s to the present, and far into the future. We   explore varied questions and issues including the increasing prevalence   of apocalyptic endings to present and future worlds; contrasts between a   fragile democratic \u2018now\u2019 vs. an authoritarian techno-future; race,   gender, and sexuality in the \u2018scientifically\u2019 engineered and   overdetermined future; class, labor and social privilege among   replicants, cyborgs, and humans; the consumption of virtual reality,   cyber-sex, and other commodities; post-technological tribalism; future   \u2018hoods and cityscapes; warnings of cyber-surveillance, techno-collapse,   and eco-disaster. And finally, we ask: what is \u2018utopia,\u2019 how is it   \u2018imagined,\u2019 and is it still possible? We develop our seminar   discussions, screenings and papers with readings from the likes of   George Orwell, Ray Kurzweil, Paul Vrilio, and Aldous Huxley, among   others. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 762, Expressive Culture: Viva Verdi Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus * The rich artistic life of Italy between the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 and the consolidation of the fascists in power in the 1920\u2019s. Italy was above all the home of opera, and we explore both the economic side of the \u201copera industry\u201d and the most important works of the peninsula\u2019s greatest composers of the day: Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Puccini, and above all Giuseppe Verdi, the most dominant artistic figure in 19th century Italy. We follow Verdi\u2019s stylistic development from the \u201cgalley years\u201d of the 1840\u2019s through the late masterpieces as well as examine the impact of Italian politics on his operas. We also read works of literature by Stendhal, di Lampedusa, Svevo, and Pirandello, and conclude with Martinetti, Boccioni, and the futurist movement in the visual arts and the relationship of these and other artists to fascism.
