While abroad at NYU in Ghana, Lindsey took a course called Documenting the African City, through which she and her group created a 15-minute documentary film on the topic of identity politics. They interviewed and filmed African Americans living in Ghana, Ghanaian professors and university students, and other local residents. Lindsey says, \u201cHaving the opportunity to document the ideas and perspectives of so many individuals was truly an eye-opening experience.\u201d      Since graduating, Lindsey returned to her hometown of New Orleans, where she became the archive and library assistant at the Amistad Research Center. Housed at Tulane University, it is the nation\u2019s largest independent archives of manuscripts, photographs, oral histories, books, periodicals, and works of art about the history of African Americans and other ethnic groups. Currently, Lindsey is the program coordinator at the Neighborhood Story Project, a nonprofit organization in partnership with the University of New Orleans. She works with writers to create documentary books about their communities using oral histories and photography. Lindsey says, \u201cWhat I experienced in Ghana has influenced my professional decisions. Traveling and exploring in an unfamiliar place removed me from my comfort zone and therefore changed me.

Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary undertaking devoted to scholarship on the histories, political and cultural movements, institutions, economies and identities of Africans and the African diaspora across the globe. Africa\u2019s own overlapping modernities and the transnational migrations of its peoples &ndash; whether forced or voluntary &ndash; have complicated the meanings of \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cAfrican\u201d identities and experiences, prompting us to rethink the geographical boundaries and conceptual paradigms surrounding the production of knowledge about Africa and its diasporic communities.      NYU's location in one of the western hemisphere\u2019s most cosmopolitan cities &ndash; home to many of the broad constituencies we aim to study in relation to their other continental settings &ndash; places us in a privileged position to lead and shape the development of Africana Studies in the 21st century. Accordingly, the program is a site for interdisciplinary and cross-cultural teaching and research in the histories, cultures, economies, politics, and languages and cultural practices of Africans in Africa, the Americas\u2013North and South, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle-East. The program maintains close relationships with community programming and research activities by NYU's Institute of African-American Affairs and Africa House.
