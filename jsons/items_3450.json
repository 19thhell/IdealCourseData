From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula.

While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Internship placements are made by EUSA, an internship placement organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.     Sample Syllabus coming soon                                                                          The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Spanish Poetry in Context - SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

This course offers an introduction to the construction of modern Spain through the study of a variety of cultural texts\u2014literature, film, the visual arts, advertising and pop music--from the 19th century to the end of the 1980s.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Spain will be presented in its diversity, richness, and uniqueness with the help of supporting materials such as newspaper articles, TV and radio programs, commercials, short films, chats, etc. Finally, our goal is that the students gain an understanding of the new culture and that they be able to create new intercultural spaces by means of the comparisons to their own culture. This course is based on culture, language and training in oral communication.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Sample Syllabus coming soon                                                                          The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Spanish Poetry in Context - SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

This introductory course will provide a survey of the development of applied linguistics from the late 1960s to the present, as well as an overview of new trends in academic research. The course is divided into three modules, each taught by a specialist, that represent three key areas within the field of applied linguistics: 1) An introduction to social and psychological aspects of the study of language; 2) Language learning: how language systems are cognitively internalized and taught; and 3) An overview of applied linguistics in translation studies and theory. The course aims to provide students with the relevant theoretical frameworks needed to pursue these three key areas of linguistic study at graduate level.    Stylistics and Semantics of Written Spanish    SPAN-GA 9108 4 points. 2013-14. The main objective of this course is to reinforce the linguistic foundations for advanced students of Spanish, aiming to improve communicative competence through a systematic study of grammatical, discursive, and pragmatic systems together with a practical study of form, function and usage in Spanish. Students will gain practice on several levels as well as guidance for their own language teaching through: 1) advanced grammar review, with special emphasis on difficult points for native English speakers, 2) identification of different grammatical structures in literary texts and journalism, allowing students to provide their own examples from other course materials, 3) a broadening of students' mastery of Spanish with specific exercises and writing activities based on textual models.

The practical component is supplemented through English Teaching Assistantships in local schools. All seminars are developed through lectures, peer commentary, and practical examples providing an overview of theories in pedagogy to be elaborated upon in future coursework. Students will prepare didactic activities, a teaching portfolio with a Statement of Teaching Philosophy, and a final written work for the course, as well as share their work with their peers in oral presentations in Spanish. Seminars will cover the following aspects of language teaching: communicative competence; new approaches to teaching grammar; acquisition of pragmatic competence; teaching culture and intercultural issues; the development of different linguistic skills (auditory, oral, written, reading comprehension); correction of errors; and language level assessment. The hours allocated to fieldwork include student collection and analysis of field data.    Applied Methodology for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9202 4 points. 2013-14. This course follows the Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language course offered in the Fall semester as a continued study of materials, approaches, and techniques used to teach language skills to second and foreign language learners while applying language acquisition theories to practice. In addition, this course emphasizes practical issues of day-to-day lesson planning to develop teaching skills, plus different methods for promoting student motivation and positive reinforcement through classroom communication. All students will observe one another's student teaching and subsequently discuss the experience together in class. A range of 3 undergraduate courses at NYU Madrid\u2014at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels\u2014will be used to offer the MA students teaching experience.    Advanced Workshop in Contemporary Hispanic Issues    SPAN-GA 9203 4 points. 2013-14.

Translation of Literary, Legal, Medical, and Business Texts    SPAN-GA 9301 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to introduce students to translation theory by working through relevant readings and, above all, practical exercises in translating literary, legal, medical and business texts. In this way, students will become familiar with the use of translation instruments (dictionaries, maps, etc.) and translation techniques (borrowing, the decision to translate proper nouns, transposition, etc.), confronting problems associated with both direct and inverse translation. These include: translating groups and clich\u00e9s; differences in customs, civilization, and culture; literal\" translation; adaptations; and casual and intentional historical allusions. Throughout the course students will have the opportunity to work on different kinds of texts related to Spain and Latin America.    Cervantes: Don Quijote    SPAN-GA 9472 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The Quijote is one of the most renowned and read works in the world, and its ability to generate critical literature seems to have no limits. In Cervantes' work, the reader assumes the role of interpreter, with both writing and reading subjected to revisions which transform the idea of literature and the fiction it represents. Students will address questions posed by the critical canon and recent studies: the Quijote as the first modern novel; its transgression of works that came before it; its inscription in a category of burlesque, humorous literature; its ability to appropriate nearly all literary models from its time. The course will situate Cervantes within the history of ideas in order to approach vital questions such as the ethical value of good intentions resolved with negative effects; the construction of identity; the dispersion and agony of the subject; reality conceived as a limitless text; the function of objects and their nominalization.    Introduction to Textual Criticism    SPAN-GA 9555 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course aims to provide students with a graduate-level introduction to criticism by studying Spanish and Latin American texts and writing analytical academic essays.

Applied Phonetics and Spoken Contemporary Spanish    SPAN-GA 9556 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the study of Spanish phonology and phonetics in order to analyze various features of spoken Spanish. The course will also explore the current state of teaching phonetics in second language acquisition and the linguistic disciplines in which phonetics proves to be a useful tool to study language. The course has both theoretical and practical components that include analyzing the distinct features of the sound systems of peninsular and American variants of spoken Spanish, allowing students to distinguish regional and social varieties of the language.    History, Memory, and Nostalgia in Contemporary Spain    SPAN-GA 9833 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The course will examine the profound imprint left by the history of Spain in the first half of the 20thcentury on the consolidation\u2014or not\u2014of a Spanish identity after the 1960s. It begins with representations in film and novels of the unresolved or unprocessed past of the Spanish Civil War. After examining the dialog between fiction and history in the \"historiographic metafiction\" of the Transition, it turns to the role of memory in cultural production, paying attention to the political debate on the recuperation of historical memory. It concludes by analyzing the nostalgic transformation of the past in the television series Cu\u00e9ntame c\u00f3mo pas\u00f3. The course aims to develop an understanding of the production and consumption of culture as a site of social action and intervention, through which power relations are established and potentially unsettled. Materials studied will include theoretical readings, cinema, television, fiction and journalism.    Photography: A Critical History    SPAN-GA 9847 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.

Interdisciplinary approaches to the studied material are encouraged through reading assignments in contemporary and critical thought (Barthes, Benjamin, Burgin, Krauss, Sontag, among others), as well as formal approaches. Literary and aesthetic texts related to the images will be read in order to examine the historical &amp; social conditions of photography from a contemporary perspective. Other topics addressed are genre studies, the relationship between text &amp; image, etc. After a general introduction on the study of form, class discussion will focus on case studies of photographic production in its historical context. The theoretical classes will be followed by mandatory practical sessions at the Reina Sof\u00eda and other museums or institutions.

This course aims to study the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian cultural heritage of Medieval Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on the contributions of Muslims, Christians, and Jews on Spanish Literature, the history of Spain, religion, philosophy, and the arts and sciences. A large part of the course will be dedicated to a comparative study among these contributions. We will also analyze the social circumstance of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in both Christian and Muslim contexts as well as the roles women played in both. The course will also analyze the problems of integration in al-Andalus and Christian Spain, as well as break from the convivencia, the Inquisition, the expulsion of the Jews, and the end of Muslim rule in 1492. Particular attention will be paid to questions of identity in minority groups in a multicultural environment. In class we will analyze, comment and discuss primary sources translated into Spanish, from each one of the three cultures, as well as documents from the era.    Literature &amp; Modernity in 19th Century Latin America    SPAN-GA.9967 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course explores the relationships between literature and discourses of political and cultural modernity in nineteenth-century Latin America. Reading critical essays, short stories and novels, we will examine how writers responded, ideologically and formally, to three key challenges in the historical transformation of political independence from Spain: the construction of modern nation-states in ethnically heterogeneous societies, political and cultural decolonization, and the commodification of social relations. We will focus on the ways in which these authors received, adapted, and contested forms of European modernity; we will analyze their rhetorical strategies and will explore how they tried to resolve profound social, cultural, and economic divisions between the criollo elites and the non-white majority, as well as between men and women.    Topics in Art History: The Power of Images in Spain and Its American Viceroyalties, 16th-18th Centuries    SPAN-GA 9990 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The colonization of Spanish America in the 16th century coincided with the rise of the power of images throughout Counter-Reformation Europe. This course looks at images, and especially paintings, as instruments of persuasion on both sides of the Atlantic. Through a series of thematic units, students will learn about the various roles that images played in all spheres of life from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Special emphasis will be placed on how paintings helped forge identities, both individual and collective, and how the same types of images could transmit different ideas depending on audience and setting. The two central aims of the course are for students to gain a greater awareness of how images are not mere illustrations of history but, on the contrary, themselves construct historical discourse; and secondly, of how cultural transfer\u2014the imposition of Spanish culture on Spanish America\u2014was accompanied by complex processes of adaptation and transformation. The course will include class visits to local museums and collections, including the Prado Museum, the convent of the Descalzas Reales, and the Museo de Am\u00e9rica, preceded by a session on how museums construct history.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.     Note: This Class does NOT currently include a trip to Morocco as in past semesters.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

Sample Syllabus coming soon                                                                          The Politics of Climate Change - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               This course examines the interaction between two coupled systems, the Earth system and humanity\u2019s political systems. Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Modern Spanish Poetry in Context - SPAN-UA 9951 - 4 points                               Course description coming soon.                                                                    Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

Applied Linguistics: A Survey of Issues in the Study of Language, Language Learning, and Translation    SPAN-GA 9107 Required of all students for the concentration in Applied Linguistics. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This introductory course will provide a survey of the development of applied linguistics from the late 1960s to the present, as well as an overview of new trends in academic research. The course is divided into three modules, each taught by a specialist, that represent three key areas within the field of applied linguistics: 1) An introduction to social and psychological aspects of the study of language; 2) Language learning: how language systems are cognitively internalized and taught; and 3) An overview of applied linguistics in translation studies and theory. The course aims to provide students with the relevant theoretical frameworks needed to pursue these three key areas of linguistic study at graduate level.    Stylistics and Semantics of Written Spanish    SPAN-GA 9108 4 points. 2013-14. The main objective of this course is to reinforce the linguistic foundations for advanced students of Spanish, aiming to improve communicative competence through a systematic study of grammatical, discursive, and pragmatic systems together with a practical study of form, function and usage in Spanish. Students will gain practice on several levels as well as guidance for their own language teaching through: 1) advanced grammar review, with special emphasis on difficult points for native English speakers, 2) identification of different grammatical structures in literary texts and journalism, allowing students to provide their own examples from other course materials, 3) a broadening of students' mastery of Spanish with specific exercises and writing activities based on textual models.    Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9201 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course comprises a weekly three-hour seminar combined with observations of \"Spanish as a second language (ELE)\" classes from NYU Madrid's undergraduate program. The practical component is supplemented through English Teaching Assistantships in local schools. All seminars are developed through lectures, peer commentary, and practical examples providing an overview of theories in pedagogy to be elaborated upon in future coursework. Students will prepare didactic activities, a teaching portfolio with a Statement of Teaching Philosophy, and a final written work for the course, as well as share their work with their peers in oral presentations in Spanish. Seminars will cover the following aspects of language teaching: communicative competence; new approaches to teaching grammar; acquisition of pragmatic competence; teaching culture and intercultural issues; the development of different linguistic skills (auditory, oral, written, reading comprehension); correction of errors; and language level assessment. The hours allocated to fieldwork include student collection and analysis of field data.    Applied Methodology for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language    SPAN-GA 9202 4 points. 2013-14.

All students will observe one another's student teaching and subsequently discuss the experience together in class. A range of 3 undergraduate courses at NYU Madrid\u2014at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels\u2014will be used to offer the MA students teaching experience.    Advanced Workshop in Contemporary Hispanic Issues    SPAN-GA 9203 4 points. 2013-14. This course aims to improve Spanish language fluency and accuracy through the study of political and social issues in the Spanish-speaking world today.

Hispanic Dialectology and Sociolinguistics    SPAN-GA 9208 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course provides a comprehensive overview of different factors that influence geographic and sociolinguistic variation in Spanish. In addition to geographic variation, students will explore gender- and age-based linguistic differences, as well as sociolinguistic variants due to social and cultural factors in Spain, Latin America, and the United States. Students will be introduced to theoretical and methodological concepts of dialectal, social, and linguistic variants in research on language contact. Through this analysis, the course will explore language as a source of cultural identity. Students will conduct their own research on specific varieties of Spanish and their social context for a final paper and will be expected to present a portion of this material and participate actively in class discussions.    Translation of Literary, Legal, Medical, and Business Texts    SPAN-GA 9301 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.

These include: translating groups and clich\u00e9s; differences in customs, civilization, and culture; literal\" translation; adaptations; and casual and intentional historical allusions. Throughout the course students will have the opportunity to work on different kinds of texts related to Spain and Latin America.    Cervantes: Don Quijote    SPAN-GA 9472 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The Quijote is one of the most renowned and read works in the world, and its ability to generate critical literature seems to have no limits. In Cervantes' work, the reader assumes the role of interpreter, with both writing and reading subjected to revisions which transform the idea of literature and the fiction it represents. Students will address questions posed by the critical canon and recent studies: the Quijote as the first modern novel; its transgression of works that came before it; its inscription in a category of burlesque, humorous literature; its ability to appropriate nearly all literary models from its time. The course will situate Cervantes within the history of ideas in order to approach vital questions such as the ethical value of good intentions resolved with negative effects; the construction of identity; the dispersion and agony of the subject; reality conceived as a limitless text; the function of objects and their nominalization.

The course will examine the profound imprint left by the history of Spain in the first half of the 20thcentury on the consolidation\u2014or not\u2014of a Spanish identity after the 1960s. It begins with representations in film and novels of the unresolved or unprocessed past of the Spanish Civil War. After examining the dialog between fiction and history in the \"historiographic metafiction\" of the Transition, it turns to the role of memory in cultural production, paying attention to the political debate on the recuperation of historical memory. It concludes by analyzing the nostalgic transformation of the past in the television series Cu\u00e9ntame c\u00f3mo pas\u00f3. The course aims to develop an understanding of the production and consumption of culture as a site of social action and intervention, through which power relations are established and potentially unsettled. Materials studied will include theoretical readings, cinema, television, fiction and journalism.    Photography: A Critical History    SPAN-GA 9847 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15.

We will focus on the ways in which these authors received, adapted, and contested forms of European modernity; we will analyze their rhetorical strategies and will explore how they tried to resolve profound social, cultural, and economic divisions between the criollo elites and the non-white majority, as well as between men and women.    Topics in Art History: The Power of Images in Spain and Its American Viceroyalties, 16th-18th Centuries    SPAN-GA 9990 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The colonization of Spanish America in the 16th century coincided with the rise of the power of images throughout Counter-Reformation Europe. This course looks at images, and especially paintings, as instruments of persuasion on both sides of the Atlantic. Through a series of thematic units, students will learn about the various roles that images played in all spheres of life from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Special emphasis will be placed on how paintings helped forge identities, both individual and collective, and how the same types of images could transmit different ideas depending on audience and setting. The two central aims of the course are for students to gain a greater awareness of how images are not mere illustrations of history but, on the contrary, themselves construct historical discourse; and secondly, of how cultural transfer\u2014the imposition of Spanish culture on Spanish America\u2014was accompanied by complex processes of adaptation and transformation. The course will include class visits to local museums and collections, including the Prado Museum, the convent of the Descalzas Reales, and the Museo de Am\u00e9rica, preceded by a session on how museums construct history.
