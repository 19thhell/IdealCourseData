This four-year project       (January 1999 - December 2002) is funded by the Josiah Macy, Jr., Foundation.       The project began with a collaborative effort to identify and define the       critical communication skills needed by physicians in the practice of       medicine. These skills are outlined in Our Competency Document that encompass       three domains: communicating with the patient, communicating about the       patient, and communicating about medicine and science. Each school is       encorporating these competencies into a communications curriculum. Other       key elements of the Macy initiative include: faculty development, curriculum       implementation, and evaluation of the education and training intervention.       A Macy Scholars Program in Health Communication will also be initiated.              Background:       The Need Identified        Beginning in the late       1960's, a growing body of research and conceptual analysis of physician-patient       ineractions documented the paramount importance of communication in health       care. Improved communication skills in practitioners increases the health       of patients by increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness       of acute, chronic, and preventive health care and enhances the satisfaction       of patients and practitioners.       Because our ability       to communicate is the major medium of practice and advancement of our       field, as well as the basis by which the public judges our profession,       improved communications will advance the field itself in fundamentally       important ways.       Medical school began       to teach communication skills, typically a six-week course given during       the first or second year. Although in 1988, 35% of schools had such teaching,       and by 1993, 65% had, communication skills during the clinical years were       not addressed and student skills were documented to decline markedly in       the clinical years.       Major leadership       organizations in academic medicine, such as the American Association of       Medical Colleges, and the LCME (the medical school accrediting agency)       have called recently for curriculum development in the area of enhanced       communication. The Macy Initiative will help medical educators at all       levels respond to this need.

The major aligns with the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication's emphasis on the intersections of media and culture as crucial to understanding and navigating an increasingly interconnected world. Students study a variety of topics such as epidemiology, media culture, politics, health policy, technology, and ethics. Students work closely with an MCC adviser to select the right mix of electives to complement individual interests and career paths.    NYU's MCC/GPH major offers undergraduate students a theoretical foundation and practical experience to prepare for entry into a wide range of career fields and graduate study. Popular industry options include: advertising and marketing, public relations, digital media, publishing, public policy, non-profit and government organizations.

Global Public Health Majors at New York University    The NYU Global Institute of Public Health (GIPH) crosses disciplinary boundaries to address the world's most pressing health problems. Drawing from resources across NYU's schools, the Institute delivers truly interdisciplinary public health education at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral level. The Institute also supports cutting-edge and collaborative research on public health issues around the world.    The GIPH builds on the global reach of NYU's unique Global Network University; draws strength from the entrepreneurial spirit of NYU's many talented faculty and students; and serves as a conduit for groundbreaking research and education that advances and promotes equitable health for all.    The highly selective, demanding undergraduate majors in Global Public Health (GIPH) allow students to choose a course of study that is a combination of public health and an academic discipline or a professional subject area housed in one of four NYU schools: the College of Arts and Science , the College of Nursing , the Silver School of Social Work , and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development .    Global Public Health is not a stand-alone major; rather, students in the various combined majors benefit from instructor, advisers, and courses both in their home school and from across the entire University. The unique structure responds to the ever-increasing demand for interdisciplinary public health practitioners both in the U.S. and abroad. The coursework is combined with experiential learning and study away requirements to ensure that students are broadly trained and uniquely prepared for a variety of careers.    In all of these majors, students take one required course in each of the six core public health areas:       Biostatistics    Epidemiology    Health policy    Environmental health    Sociobehavioral health    Internship       Students also take courses in their chosen field within Steinhardt, with the exact number of courses varying by major. Students fill out their coursework with electives in global public health and/or the Steinhardt major field (chosen in consultation with an adviser) to compliment individual interests and career paths and study of a foreign language.
