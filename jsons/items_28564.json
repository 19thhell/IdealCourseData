Tolerance of borderline clinical competence and unprofessional behavior is also toxic to the educational and patient care environment and does not go unnoticed by the student body . With performance-based clinical competence measures becoming increasingly important in medical training, medical educators are in need of rational, respectful and effective programs to deal with trainees who are experiencing difficulties meeting clinical standards\u2014most of whom will become practicing physicians.     In our experiences working with individual trainees who underperform on high-stakes clinical skills examinations, or are singled out on the wards, we have found that these learners are a heterogeneous group who present a broad range of complex issues. Many are not identified as needing help until late in their clerkship years or after. In order to assist these learners, we have developed an evolving framework of strategies for understanding and diagnosing clinical performance problems and a systematic approach to remediation that includes reflective writing, role-play, clinical observation, videotape self-assessment, and consultations with cognitive psychologists, psychiatrists and learning specialists as needed.     We are also working to expand institutional capacity to address inadequate clinical competence in trainees along the spectrum of medical education by equipping NYUSOM faculty with the requisite skills. \u00a0 Initial results of our clinical skills remediation faculty workshop were presented before a national audience:              Kalet AL, Tewksbury LR, Hyland Bruno J, Taffel L, Zabar S.

Tolerance of borderline clinical competence and unprofessional behavior is also toxic to the educational and patient care environment and does not go unnoticed by the student body . With performance-based clinical competence measures becoming increasingly important in medical training, medical educators are in need of rational, respectful and effective programs to deal with trainees who are experiencing difficulties meeting clinical standards\u2014most of whom will become practicing physicians.     In our experiences working with individual trainees who underperform on high-stakes clinical skills examinations, or are singled out on the wards, we have found that these learners are a heterogeneous group who present a broad range of complex issues. Many are not identified as needing help until late in their clerkship years or after. In order to assist these learners, we have developed an evolving framework of strategies for understanding and diagnosing clinical performance problems and a systematic approach to remediation that includes reflective writing, role-play, clinical observation, videotape self-assessment, and consultations with cognitive psychologists, psychiatrists and learning specialists as needed.     We are also working to expand institutional capacity to address inadequate clinical competence in trainees along the spectrum of medical education by equipping NYUSOM faculty with the requisite skills. \u00a0 Initial results of our clinical skills remediation faculty workshop were presented before a national audience:              Kalet AL, Tewksbury LR, Hyland Bruno J, Taffel L, Zabar S.

Effect            Course Number: CSCD-GE.2136/MPAVP-GE.2175    Instructor: Celia Stewart    Points: 2    Course meets: 1/12 &amp; 1/13 MoTu 12:30-4:15pm; 1/14 &amp; 1/15 WedTh 1:30-4pm; 1/20 &amp; 1/21 TuWed 1:30-4pm; 1/23/2015 Fri 4-6pm    Description: This course will focus on the collaborative interdisciplinary remediation of singers by vocologists (speech language pathologist &amp; singing teachers), &amp; otolaryngologists. Through master clinician demonstrations, student led discussions, &amp; hands on voice training experience, student clinicians will work as a team to evaluate, develop, implement, &amp; critique the effectiveness of the training/treatment. Students will use evidence based practice, discipline specific vocal exercises, &amp; approaches to heighten efficiency of the vocal mechanism in order to reduce effort. Psychological aspects of voice use as well as body awareness will be discussed to aid in the promotion of sustainable production of voice in both speech &amp; singing.    For more information regarding professors and meeting times, students can use Albert directly. The course can be found under both the Department of Communcative Sciences and Disorders and the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions.
