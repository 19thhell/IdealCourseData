Reactions and kinetics are also discussed for inorganic, organometallic, and bioinorganic compounds. Selected topics in main group chemistry are also included. CHEM-UA 881 Biochemistry I (4 credits) Professor: Traaseth (lecture) Lecture: Tuesday and Thursday, 4:55PM-6:10PM Prerequisite: Organic Chemistry II (or equivalent) with a grade of C or better. Offered in the spring and fall. Course Summary: Introduction to the chemistry of living cells. Topics include structure and function of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids; enzyme structure, mechanism and regulation of enzyme activity, and membrane structure and transport; and mechanisms of cellular processes and cellular physiology, including ion channels and pumps, cell motility, and the immune response. The second term emphasizes analysis of basic metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as mechanisms of metabolic regulation and integration.

CHEM-UA 890 Advanced Biochemistry (4 credits) Professor: Geacintov Lecture: Monday and Wednesday 11:00AM-12:15PM Registration Notes: Formerly CHEM-GA 1814 (Biophysical Chemistry). Prerequisite or corequisite: Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics &amp; Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) and Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics &amp; Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652). Recommended: Biochemistry I (CHEM-UA 881). Offered in the Fall. Course Summary: Overview of physical and chemical principles and their applications to modern topics of biochemical, biomedical and biological interest. The emphasis is on the basic principles of typical biophysical techniques that are used to study important macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. Topics include molecular spectroscopic techniques such as light absorption, fluorescence techniques, optical activity, electrophoresis, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Applications from selected areas of biomedicine and biotechnology are described that include examples focused on biomolecular spectroscopy, single molecule spectroscopy and molecular beacons, DNA technology, and fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging.  CHEM-UA 911 Advanced Organic Chemistry (4 credits) Professor: Arora Lecture: Tuesday and Thursday 3:30PM-4:45PM Prerequisite: Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226) or Majors Organic Chemistry II (CHEM-UA 228) with a C or better. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Course Summary: This course focuses on structure and theory in organic chemistry with a particular emphasis on the application of stereoelectronic and conformational effects on reaction mechanisms, catalysis and molecular recognition. CHEM-UA 996 Senior Honors in Chemistry (2-4 credits) Professor: Goldberg Lecture: Seminar Style - TBD Registration Notes: Prerequisites: completion of the required core courses for the major and permission of the department. Open only to chemistry or biochemistry majors, entering their senior year, who have maintained an overall average of 3.65 in their course of study and in the courses required for their major. Required for candidates for the degree with honors. CHEM-UA 995 offered in the fall; CHEM-UA 996 offered in the spring. Course Summary: In consultation with the director of undergraduate studies, the student chooses a faculty member to serve as adviser in an independent program of research in experimental or theoretical chemistry. The student selects an adviser in the spring of the junior year or earlier and undertakes the work that spring, the following summer, and into the senior year. A written progress report at the end of the fall semester of the senior year is required. The research is completed during the spring term, and the student presents the work at the annual College of Arts and Science Undergraduate Research Conference near the end of the term. The research culminates in the writing of a senior thesis that must be approved by the adviser and the director of undergraduate studies. CHEM-UA 998 Advanced Independent Study and Research (2-4 credits) Professor: Kahr Lecture: Research Registration Notes: Prerequisite: permission of the department. Open to students majoring in chemistry or biochemistry who have maintained an average of 3.0 or better in all departmentally required courses and who possess the necessary ability to pursue research in a field of chemistry or biochemistry. The research adviser is selected in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Laboratory. CHEM-UA 997 offered in the fall; CHEM-UA 998 offered in the spring. Course Summary: Individual study in a selected area tailored to the student\u2019s needs insofar as is possible. Training is provided in current research areas. Requires a written progress report at the end of the fall semester and a final research report at the close of the academic year (spring semester).
