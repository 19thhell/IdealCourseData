It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq. FREN-UA 991.002 La Politique des Images en France Prof. Ludovic Cortade TR, 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm 194 Mercer, 208 #6884 Ce s\u00e9minaire, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants \u00abSenior\u00bb, offre une m\u00e9thode pour comprendre l\u2019importance et l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence des images dans notre civilisation, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, en France. Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.  FREN-UA 965 (conducted in French ) Topics in French Literature: Slavery in the Francophone World Prof. C\u00e9cile Bishop MW, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-19 #8726 Between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century, France was responsible for the kidnapping, forced transport and brutal enslavement of over a million Africans. This course examines representations of slavery in a wide range of media including literature, film and visual arts, from the late 18th century to the present day. In addition to exploring the role of slavery in shaping French and francophone cultures, students will develop new perspectives on the power and limits of literature and art in representing violence and suffering. Authors studied include Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Claire de Duras, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Maryse Cond\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 Schwarz-Bart and Patrick Chamoiseau.

Adopting a chronological approach, we will explore the different stages of Paris\u2019 development through the analysis of numerous historical and literary texts, maps, paintings, photographs and movies. In the process, we will journey through over 2000 years of French history, discovering major political, social and artistic events, and developing a vision of the organic growth of the city.

One film is viewed per week and   analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and   poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media   and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these   media so often focus.

FREN-UA 145 Approaches to Francophone Literature Prof. St\u00e9phane Gerson TR, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-4 #8249 The course examines the conceptualizing of Francophonie through the literature from a network of French-speaking countries which together form a Francophone space. It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq. FREN-UA 991.002 La Politique des Images en France Prof. Ludovic Cortade TR, 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm 194 Mercer, 208 #6884 Ce s\u00e9minaire, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants \u00abSenior\u00bb, offre une m\u00e9thode pour comprendre l\u2019importance et l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence des images dans notre civilisation, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, en France. Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.  FREN-UA 965 (conducted in French ) Topics in French Literature: Slavery in the Francophone World Prof. C\u00e9cile Bishop MW, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-19 #8726 Between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century, France was responsible for the kidnapping, forced transport and brutal enslavement of over a million Africans. This course examines representations of slavery in a wide range of media including literature, film and visual arts, from the late 18th century to the present day. In addition to exploring the role of slavery in shaping French and francophone cultures, students will develop new perspectives on the power and limits of literature and art in representing violence and suffering. Authors studied include Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Claire de Duras, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Maryse Cond\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 Schwarz-Bart and Patrick Chamoiseau.

Adopting a chronological approach, we will explore the different stages of Paris\u2019 development through the analysis of numerous historical and literary texts, maps, paintings, photographs and movies. In the process, we will journey through over 2000 years of French history, discovering major political, social and artistic events, and developing a vision of the organic growth of the city.

One film is viewed per week and   analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and   poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media   and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these   media so often focus.

By analyzing plays, chronicles, poems, and novels, students explore the role and status of literature within the era's larger intellectual, political, and social framework.

FREN-UA 145 Approaches to Francophone Literature Prof. St\u00e9phane Gerson TR, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-4 #8249 The course examines the conceptualizing of Francophonie through the literature from a network of French-speaking countries which together form a Francophone space. It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria. FREN-UA 164 Contemporary France Prof. Nils Froment TR, 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Silver 404 #8728 An introduction to French history, politics, and social relations from 1900 to the present.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq. FREN-UA 991.002 La Politique des Images en France Prof. Ludovic Cortade TR, 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm 194 Mercer, 208 #6884 Ce s\u00e9minaire, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants \u00abSenior\u00bb, offre une m\u00e9thode pour comprendre l\u2019importance et l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence des images dans notre civilisation, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, en France. Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.
