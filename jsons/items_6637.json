Description       This is a course about ostensibly illicit, sometimes illegal, acts done to works of art, such as destruction, theft, forgery, ruinous or deceitful restoration, and unwitting conflation with divinity or living reality. To think about what we\u2019re not supposed to do with art is also to historicize what we now seem encouraged or permitted to do with it, like emote, collect, trade, authenticate, display, conserve, and sometimes censor, or worship after all. In examining how such practices and values coalesced, and the controversies that have attended them, we aim to better understand how artworks have challenged the boundaries among intellectual property, personal property, and cultural property\u2014and why, long into the secular age, they are often treated not only as matter, but presence. In addition to readings drawn from art history, anthropology, philosophy, and law, course materials include forgers\u2019 memoirs, art-heist films, and artworks that have at some point been deemed improper, whether idolatrous, pornographic, or (under Nazism) \u201cdegenerate.\u201d                   Course Type       First-Year Program: Research Seminars (FIRST-UG)                               top of page                                                                   NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

The increase in international art transactions has incubated a booming market for stolen and fraudulent art, and major U.S. arts institutions still grapple with repatriation of stolen or looted objects in their collections. Co-organized by Jane C.H. Jacob , art historian and provenance research expert, Jacob Fine Art, Inc., Chris Marinello, director and founder, Art Recovery Group, and Alice Farren-Bradley, Museum Security Network, the symposium brings together experts from major museums and auction houses, the NYU School of Law, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the President\u2019s Cultural Property Advisory Committee, as well as independent scholars and authors, art crime victims, art crime attorneys, forensic scientists, and other major players working to address art crime worldwide.   Join us and learn about the legal, forensic, governmental, and political strategies being employed to address the enormity of this global phenomenon. Topics include the history of fakes and forgeries, insurance fraud, art theft and art scams, scientific and forensic approaches, provenance research, cultural repatriation, issues facing auction houses and purchasers, and current case studies.         CLE units and financial aid are available for those who qualify. Attorneys attending the symposium can earn 8 CLEs in Professional Practice: 3.5 CLEs (June 4), 2.5 CLEs (June 5), and 2.0 CLEs (June 6). CLEs are transitional.
