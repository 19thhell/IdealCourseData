Students should not schedule any classes immediately before or after this class to allow ample time to travel to off-site locations including museums and galleries. Students are expected to pay for their own travel expenses.                    Description       Exhibitions are spaces of knowledge, experience, and entertainment. This course studies the methods, functions, and conditions of exhibition practice, through visual and textual analysis as well as exhibition visits. Although the history of exhibitions and museums, from the 18th to 21st century, will provide a foundation for this course, special attention will be paid to the present. New York will be considered as a center of cultural experimentation where artists (including Latin American artists) share ideas in a global context. We will visit a variety of exhibitions on view in the city, when class will be on-site in order to develop critical skills and address the following questions: What are the major theoretical and practical issues at stake in different kinds of exhibitions, and how can we perceive their significance? What is the relationship between the curator and artist/s? What role does museum architecture play in creating a context for experiencing exhibitions? What are some productive interactions between exhibitions and contemporary thought? Finally, what is an exhibition? Readings will include essays by curators, writers, and critics such as Walter Benjamin, Jorge Luis Borges, Michael Brenson, Brian O\u2019Doherty and Mari Carmen Ram\u00edrez.

The course begins with discussions concerning author, text, and context that took place within the British and American literary circles of the 1940s, \u201950s, and \u201960s \u2013 clashes over the origin and location of meaning that challenged the ways in which artists and critics had traditionally conceived of their work. These debates led to broad reevaluations \u2013 sometimes quite radical \u2013 of the interpretive act itself within both the academic and public spheres. The course continues with close analysis of the so-called \u201cLinguistic Turn\u201d of the 1970s and early \u201980s, which both reflected and fomented broader shifts and revolutions of thought within the contemporary western world. The final weeks of the semester culminate with an exploration of critical interpretive trends today: theories of culture, narrative, memory, representation, power, disciplinarity, and interdisciplinarity. Students will emerge from the course with a stronger historical grasp of the interpretive theory of the past century, and will be challenged to use the course\u2019s introductory framework to identify and to develop further the theoretical underpinnings of their own individual graduate work. Readings will be applicable to all humanities fields and shall include cultural critics such as Bhabha, Butler, and Fish, as well as more philosophical voices such as Barthes, Derrida, Spivak, and Zizek. Guest appearances by Gallatin faculty will facilitate a broad interdisciplinary discussion of not only the theory, but its application in research and practice.

Students should not schedule any classes immediately before or after this class to allow ample time to travel to off-site locations including museums and galleries. Students are expected to pay for their own travel expenses.                    Description       Exhibitions are spaces of knowledge, experience, and entertainment. This course studies the methods, functions, and conditions of exhibition practice, through visual and textual analysis as well as exhibition visits. Although the history of exhibitions and museums, from the 18th to 21st century, will provide a foundation for this course, special attention will be paid to the present. New York will be considered as a center of cultural experimentation where artists (including Latin American artists) share ideas in a global context. We will visit a variety of exhibitions on view in the city, when class will be on-site in order to develop critical skills and address the following questions: What are the major theoretical and practical issues at stake in different kinds of exhibitions, and how can we perceive their significance? What is the relationship between the curator and artist/s? What role does museum architecture play in creating a context for experiencing exhibitions? What are some productive interactions between exhibitions and contemporary thought? Finally, what is an exhibition? Readings will include essays by curators, writers, and critics such as Walter Benjamin, Jorge Luis Borges, Michael Brenson, Brian O\u2019Doherty and Mari Carmen Ram\u00edrez.

The course begins with discussions concerning author, text, and context that took place within the British and American literary circles of the 1940s, \u201950s, and \u201960s \u2013 clashes over the origin and location of meaning that challenged the ways in which artists and critics had traditionally conceived of their work. These debates led to broad reevaluations \u2013 sometimes quite radical \u2013 of the interpretive act itself within both the academic and public spheres. The course continues with close analysis of the so-called \u201cLinguistic Turn\u201d of the 1970s and early \u201980s, which both reflected and fomented broader shifts and revolutions of thought within the contemporary western world. The final weeks of the semester culminate with an exploration of critical interpretive trends today: theories of culture, narrative, memory, representation, power, disciplinarity, and interdisciplinarity. Students will emerge from the course with a stronger historical grasp of the interpretive theory of the past century, and will be challenged to use the course\u2019s introductory framework to identify and to develop further the theoretical underpinnings of their own individual graduate work. Readings will be applicable to all humanities fields and shall include cultural critics such as Bhabha, Butler, and Fish, as well as more philosophical voices such as Barthes, Derrida, Spivak, and Zizek. Guest appearances by Gallatin faculty will facilitate a broad interdisciplinary discussion of not only the theory, but its application in research and practice.
