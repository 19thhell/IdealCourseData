Admission Requirements   To be eligible for admission to the School of Engineering&#39;s MS in Transportation Management program, you must hold at least a baccalaureate degree from an acceptable institution. You must also show evidence of quantitative analytic ability, generally including a minimum of 2 years of college mathematics. A college-level course in statistics is desirable.   If admitted, students lacking such skills must take remedial courses in addition to degree requirements to strengthen their analytic competency.   All foreign students admitted to transportation programs must take an examination in English before registration.

The program has a strong foundation in traffic engineering, transportation planning, transportation economics, public transportation systems, and intelligent transportation systems. To ensure that you are immediately productive upon graduation, you will tackle projects you will face on the job and work hands-on with modern tools, including, but not limited to Synchro and SIM-Traffic and other simulation programs, HCS+, AutoCAD templates for intersection design, and data collection and processing software.   The program includes a strong focus on the rapidly emerging field of intelligent transportation systems. This field applies telecommunications and information technology to solving a variety of transportation functions, from route guidance systems to automated toll collection systems to the automated highway.   Admission Requirements   You must hold at least a baccalaureate degree from an acceptable institution. You must also have a firm background in quantitative analytic skills. If admitted, students lacking such skills must take remedial courses in addition to degree requirements to strengthen their analytic competency.   In addition, you must show evidence of quantitative analytic ability, generally including a minimum of 2 years of college mathematics. A college-level course in statistics is desirable.   Finally, all foreign students admitted to the program must take an examination in English before registration. Based upon an evaluation of the examination, you may be required to take up to 2 additional courses in English as a Second Language (ESL) for which no graduate credit is given.
