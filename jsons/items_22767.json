The journal was created in 2006 and published its first edition on &quot;Development Issues&quot; the same year.

THRILL is unique in that it focuses on issues and topics that put the needs of the human being first- not the needs of the state, the shareholder, the donor or the recipient, an industry, or even the international community as a whole. As a growing concentration, it should follow suit that human rights and international law students have adequate representation in academia, student affairs, SCPS events and external networks. THRILL exists to help bridge this gap in three particular ways:     Host events and discussions that fit our academic and career interests and goals;     Hold student discussion groups to debate and discuss issues relevant to the field of     international law and human rights;     Advocate for events and initiatives related to human rights and international law within the MSGA program as a whole.         THRILL is open to any student interested in the topic areas.

Nearly every day we wake up to something new and unanticipated. This concentration is designed to give students an advanced understanding of the factors shaping IR, and to place these factors in a futures context. What alternate future scenarios can we imagine? What are the forces for change in IR? How are these forces shaping the policies and capabilities of states and nonstate actors? What are the emerging issues that the world will have to face, and how might they be addressed? Courses within this concentration help students improve their ability to anticipate change, and equip them with the analytical tools essential for professional success in a transforming environment.

This concentration introduces students to the new transnational security agenda by combining the study of traditional issues such as war and disarmament with more contemporary issues, including terrorism, organized crime, and human security scourges. These complex and interconnected challenges are as often the domain of aid workers, police officers, and development specialists as they are of soldiers, spies, and diplomats. The concentration provides students with a combination of knowledge and practical skills preparing them to address security issues and risk assessment in the context of the private and NGO sector, as well as government service.
