Offers several areas of study, including:       game design    game development    game research    a student-customized area of study under faculty supervision          The program can be pursued full- or part-time (see degree requirements for more information ).    Student Learning Goals    In this program, students will learn to be game design practitioners who not only understand technical and development practices but also the social, cognitive, emotional and cultural issues involved in the design of games for the specific purpose of learning in formal and informal settings, and across the lifespan. To that end, students will be able to:       Explain the potential values and limitations of the use of digital games for learning, and for what kinds of learning, what types of learners, in what content domains, and in what settings games have the potential to support learning, as supported by current theory and research.          Discuss the role and function of play in games for learning and, in that context, the contribution of diverse features of games, such as role playing, immersion, narrative, feedback, situated experience, distributed cognition, lower consequences of failure, etc.          Apply the social, cognitive, emotional and cultural dimensions of factors that influence learning, in game design.          Demonstrate competency in one of the following areas: the technical development of digital games for learning; the learning design of digital games; the methods for research and evaluation of games for learning; or in a related area as deemed appropriate by program faculty.       Students will also be prepared to use evidence-based research to facilitate the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of programs that integrate games in a broad range of formal and informal learning settings. To that end, students will be able to:       Apply theories in the learning sciences and cognitive science that are relevant to effective game design for learning, for a broad range of learners, using theory in both formal and informal settings; and drawing implications from these theories, in the form of instructional and learning strategies and principles, to design effective games for learning.          Demonstrate competency in conducting design-based research to support the development of effective games for learning, including usability research, playtesting and various approaches to evaluation.       Games for Learning Institute       Students enrolled in the Games for Learning M.S. program benefit from exposure to and participation in the Games for Learning Institute's ongoing research endeavors and emerging ideas about gaming. The establishment of the Games for Learning Institute (G4LI) demonstrates NYU's leadership in research on games in learning environments. G4LI, which involves nine other universities, conducts research on the design of effective games for learning in a variety of formal and informal settings, in school and out of school, at a computer/game console and on the go, and for a broad variety of learners. G4LI is co-directed by Jan Plass , Professor of Educational Communication and Technology at NYU Steinhardt.       Comparison with Other Programs    The Games for Learning M.S. program is different from the M.A. program in Digital Media Design for Learning (DMDL) , which prepares professionals who design, implement and evaluate a wider range of multimedia for learning, including educational web environments, video drama and documentary, and other genres in digital form. The M.S. in Games for Learning also differs from graduate degrees focusing on general game design by focusing on the unique training required to design games that focus on learning.    Career Opportunities    The M.S. degree program prepares students for careers as:       directors of projects related to games for learning    learning game designers    game researchers    program evaluators       Graduates work in such settings as:       university-based research centers    community agencies    not-for profit organizations    school systems    private industry, such as game design studios, educational design firms, and educational research firms       Inquiries    For complete details on how to apply and application requirements, visit our application guide on the Graduate Admissions website.

Students may also participate in an optional 3-credit internship.    In addition to the required foundation courses, students can specialize in one of four areas of study.    International students may be required to take English language courses in addition to the 36 credits required for the Master of Science degree. This determination is made on the basis of scores on an English language proficiency examination all international students take upon arriving at NYU.          Areas of Study       Students also pursue one or more of the following four areas of study, based on their selection of electives (students are permitted to choose courses from more than one area of study). It is recommended that students choose one area of study in which they take at least 12 credits, but modifications may be made (i.e., choosing 12 credits from two different areas of study) or a new area of study may be selected. Both of these options must be exercised under the advisement, supervision, and approval of program faculty. Game Design: Focus on design principles and problems, as well as historical factors, related to commercial and educational game design. Game Development: Focus on game development skills, such as programming, graphic design, 3-D development and audio design. Game Research: Focus on research approaches and methods (qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods) as related to game and media evaluation and development. Other Areas of Study: With special permission from program faculty, a student can elect another area of study as applicable through independent study, through selection of courses from multiple areas of study as specified above, or other courses offered at the university.

This work culminates in a final integrative project (e.g., a publishable quality research thesis, learning game design document and game prototype, learning game usability, playtesting, or evaluation study).          Residency and Transfer Credit       Of the 36 credits required for the Master of Science degree, students are required to take 24 credits in residency, defined as courses taken at NYU. A maximum of 30% of the 36 credits required for the degree may be considered for transfer from other universities; such courses must be evaluated by faculty advisors to establish whether they meet criteria established by the Steinhardt School.          Tenure of Matriculation       The Steinhardt School requires students to complete requirements for the Master of Science degree within six (6) years of matriculation, defined as the first semester of enrollment for courses leading to the degree. The clock stops only during official leaves of absence. This applies to both full-time and part-time students. Regardless of matriculation, the validity of courses towards a degree expire after 10 years.    From the Steinhardt Graduate Bulletin: \"A candidate has a six-year period following the date of matriculation for the completion of all requirements. If continuous matriculation has not been maintained, a reevaluation of credentials is necessary, and only those courses completed within the last 10-year period will be credited.\"          Scholastic Average       Master of Science students must maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average in Games for Learning courses and in their overall academic record.          Maintenance of Matriculation       Students must maintain \"active status\" throughout their studies, beginning with the first semester of matriculation and including the semester in which they intend to graduate. To do so, Master of Science students must complete at least three (3) graduate-level credits each fall and spring semester (not summer). If students cannot enroll in course work in a given fall or spring semester, they must register for Maintaining Matriculation (MAINT-GE 4747), for which they pay a non-credit bearing maintenance of matriculation fee.    Registration for Maintaining Matriculation entitles students to use the libraries and other facilities, consult members of the faculty, participate in University activities, and use student health services and the Coles Sports Center. This option may be used during the semester in which students intend to graduate, if they are completing incomplete course work but taking no additional course work. Students may register for MAINT-GE 4747 only after they have been enrolled during one academic year for a minimum of three (3) credits and with permission of a faculty advisor. Students may register for MAINT-GE 4747 for up to a total of two (2) years within the six-year period allowed to complete the degree.          Course Selection       Students should select their classes in conjunction with their academic advisor. Please use the Course registration worksheet (advising form), and once your advisor has approved it, turn it in to the department staff in 600 Pless Hall. After the department enters your advisor clearance (typically within 1-2 business days), you can sign up for courses online in Albert .                     There is a guide to planning your courses available .
