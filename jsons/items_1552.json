By noon the god hangs high,   and she sits in the shade of home,   the trickle-wind of the river grazing   her forearms that strain dicing   spheres of tomato small,   meticulating with knife and hand,   sharp and damp, the girth of fruit   and mother   by the light that told Eratosthenes   the circumference of the world.   She labors to the cusp of night,   working into filling   the parts of beast and field   she&#146;s ground, salted, oiled   and rolls then folds, bit by bit,   the veined linen of the vine,   wrapping the flat-lain leaves   as full of care as Isis   tethered first the head,   then each finger, every toe,   weeping resin to hold   the pieces of her husband.   (a Hebrew mother used   pitch and bitumen glue   to hold a bulrush ark to save   her son from Pharaoh)   While the mummies boil to life   she sits to sew a sleeve,   twining the fabric of the fields   make-shift as the byblus boat   the widow-queen made, frantic   in the swallow-craze of sorrow,   the delta reeds where she split   pressing Horus out at vernal equinox,   that first green break through earth.   She treads the steps of the Holy Family   downstairs to the Hanging Church   and crosses herself on the threshold-   pause of mother, brink of barren,   the last drop she would flood   and grieve like ancient reapers   crying out to the magic goddess   whom the Virgin eclipsed.   At home, under the moon of ancient Jesus,   she builds a pyramid of the flesh she&#146;s made   and offers, steaming live and holy, to her family.   The father sees, by the smoke of priest and tomb,   God blessing bounty.     The Third     Crying and crying in the Cairene alley,   myriad cats cannot hear the adhan;   Things blow up; the peaces cannot hold   al-jihad is loosed upon the world--   the holy strife is loosed, and everywhere   the capacity for compassion wanes;   the best negotiate, while the worst   burst with their bombs, fight stones with fire.   Surely some solution is at hand;   surely Allahu Akhbar is at hand.   Allahu Akhbar! How could He with seed bless them all   as the dust of the earth, the number of stars,   and only some with land? Somewhere in the desert   a spawn with pigeon body and the head of a ram,   a pull crazy and constant as the moon&#146;s,   is flitting its lame wings, while all about it   alight doves spurned into belligerent hawks.   The morning strikes again, but now I know   that half a century of betrayal   was terrorized by a dual promise.   And what sleek flight, its moment mounting fast,   reels back to Jerusalem to land?             Crossing     Forehead, chest, right, left-   I crossed Catholicly at Coptic[1] mass,   sat wrong, with the men,   faced God with no foulard[2]   and had not fasted.     Left shoulder is holy ghost   and right amen, I tried   to train my brain,   to kneel and stand as long as they   and pray.     I did not commune today,   but learned the body order   of father, son, and holy ghost,   amen.------------------------------------------------------------------------   [1] Egyptian orthodox   [2] headscarf; should be worn by Coptic women in church     Ramadan Vigil     Though not present   at the gibbous moon   this laylat al-qadr,   he kneeled and bent and lay,   pressed his head to the carpet to say   allahu akhbar, up and down alone   in waxing foreign light,   while Cairene mosques teemed   at midnight towards Mecca.   As women wandered through   the Gamaliya alleyways,   waddled under platters of fuul   to fill the prayers at Al-Azhar   he told the Jersey City factory:   &#147;fasting is exam for the people&#148;   that 27th day he did not eat.   At sunset, he broke fast in break-time,   showing that Ramadan is easier   in this kind of winter, and   &#147;this day is better than a thousand months&#148;   while his fathers spoke again   every word that had come down   to light the Night of Measure.       &#147;A Brief Talk about History&#148;     History, what is history?           Was it Menes or the Nile that linked the   lotus and papyrus, put the body to the head?   Past events,                A perfect   pyramid marked the order of man,   the measure of the god in Cheops, how the eye to the northern star can be keener   than the compass.   a record of the past,             Herodotus on the gift of the Nile   people,                  farmers flooded out of the fields from   August to September toiling up the ramps, building to the sky, for twenty years   people that make events.           Akhenaton worshipped only one- the disk of   the rising sun, until the priests of Thebes erased him; Alexander came and conquered.     It is continuous, a continuous process,      Greece flowed into Egypt&#133;   like a stream that flows through time       the Nile fed Rome;   and goes back to ancient times      Thutmose tombed first in the rock of   before any written record.           the valley.

The old apartment was black and bare: the beds and couches   had been removed, the carpets reversed, the mirrors and pictures turned to the   walls. Though he had been away for over a decade, the men in the living   room barely stirred to greet him. They were sitting quietly, smoking and   sipping Turkish coffee from black cups with no sugar while their women wailed   from Mina&#146;s bedroom; not even the joy of homecoming should disrupt the   vigil. &#145;Adel walked through solemnly, touched the hand of his older   brother Saad, and sank down to the ottoman beside him. Friends and relatives   had flocked from all over Egypt to grieve with them. There were cousins   who had grown up, uncles who had balded, the boab who&#146;d been guarding that   building for decades, and a host of other familiar faces. They, like the   government, had expected him to return after finishing medical school in London.   He was supposed to come back immediately and serve in the military. But   &#145;Adel had stayed away. From London he crossed the Atlantic on a red   carpet to Philadelphia. In the thick of Vietnam, America needed doctors.   This was his first time home. His Egyptian passport had expired; he was   safe, American.   When Amin, who was one of the long lost faces mourning with the family, realized   who had entered he couldn&#146;t restrain himself and called, &#147;ahlan wa   sahlan, Doctor &#145;Adel!&#148; from across the room, initiating a solemn chorus   of &#147;maalaysh, ya doctor&#148; among the others. As a child, he used   to serve &#145;Adel and his siblings Parisian style pastries and creamed British   tea in their villa in Asyut during the final years of Faruq. Their father   died before the revolution, and the headless family moved to the delta, leaving   both the man and the boy in the last Christian village of the country.   While the boys grew into doctors and the girls into teachers, he fathered six   children and widowed a wife. &#145;Adel didn&#146;t recognize him that   day, but he could tell from his accent that he was a saidy. &#147;Ahlan,   ya oustaz,&#148; he said, acknowledging him with a nod of the head, and the   old man gleamed with gratitude.   &#145;Adel found this spontaneous display of excitement far less offensive than   the shrill zagreet of lamentation with which the female guests would announce   themselves at the door, inciting rounds of shrieks from the women in the back.   He was glad he had missed the first outburst of grief at the moment of death,   when even the men were to show their pain. He remembered how terrible   it was when his mother died. His sisters and aunts ran about her bed like   chickens being slaughtered, wailing and screaming, &#147;ya mama! ya okhty!&#148;   to get her to rise and see what sorrow she had caused. He hated to see   them crazy like that, and to have to cry out loud in public. He was relieved   when he and his brother could retreat into the living room while their sisters   washed and dressed the body.   Saad had been in medical school at the time, and &#145;Adel was following in   his footsteps at the University of Alexandria. Despite their orphanage   and age, the men had little privacy or freedom. Mina, the oldest of the   siblings, succeeded her mother as the matriarch of the family, and she was more   tyrannical than any father could have been. They were a good Coptic family,   and they had to maintain their dignified name. She had no problems with   her younger sister, who was incapable of vanity or defiance. Mary didn&#146;t   paint her face or cinch her waist with the leather left from Europe to walk   by the boys at the cinema with theless respectable girls. Most of the   time she was in the home cooking and cleaning up after her brothers, leaving   only to shop and go to church, where she taught the children the about the saints.   She had had a couple of suitors, but she could not engage until her older sister   married, and Mina had rejected the few proposals she had received. She   fancied herself the last pillar of the family: Saad was too immature and selfish   to take control, Mary too meek and fragile, and &#145;Adel was the baby.     As the youngest in the family &#145;Adel had always been the most adored and   the most pampered. He didn&#146;t attend school until the age of twelve   because of his severe asthma, and the sisters would wait on him as if he were   a little king. Even after he grew up they smothered him with attention   and affection, and he bore the burden of being the preferred brother.     Saad had no patience for their meddling and doting. Soon after his mother   died Mina found out that he&#146;d having an affair with a pharmacist.   He couldn&#146;t be carousing around with a young woman to whom he wasn&#146;t   engaged, and she was not suitable for marriage. She was from a Protestant   family of shopkeepers; she smoked in public like a man. Saad denied that   he was involved with her and continued seeing her in secret. Saad was   also drinking a lot- Scotch he&#146;d been getting off of the black market.   &#145;Adel was worried, but he wouldn&#146;t interfere. Egypt was suffocating   both of them, and every little freedom was precious when Nasser was aligned   with the Soviets, when people would disappear in the night and never be heard   from again. He would let his brother have his woman and his whisky, and   he would find his own liberation.   He had a lover in America, where he could look at a woman and like it.   He&#146;d met Laura in the operating room. She was a nurse and beautiful.   She had looked back, her green eyes gleaming, like no Egyptian woman would.   It was simple: there were no secret rendez-vous, no mothers putting their heads   together, making matches.   On the balcony stood a woman and a girl, both wearing shabby indigo robes, on   a break from their frenzy. The tall, strong girl looked wild- her frizzy brown   mane flailing in the Mediterranean breeze, her skin splotched red from having   hit herself. She was Amin&#146;s oldest daughter, and though she had never   met Mina, she was grieving hard like she&#146;d learned when her mother died   deep down in the valley. The little woman was gripping her hand, as if   she needed the savage to hold her up. Her straight black hair hung in   disheveled streams down her meager torso, though she usually kept it tied in   a tight bun. &#145;Adel recognized that humble hunching body as his sister.   He stepped out with dread to greet her. &#147; &#145;Adel!&#148; she screamed   when she saw him, shrill as her grieving, and threw her feeble arms around his   waist. &#147;Al-hamdulilla, habibti, il-hamdulilla!&#148; she said, crying   into the barrel of his chest.   &#147;Ahlan, ya okhty,&#148; he said calmly patting her back.   &#147;You look sick,&#148; she said, still clutching him, &#147;there is no   one to take care of you over there.&#148;   But there was. He was practically living with Laura. &#147;I&#146;m   fine, ya okhty,&#148; he said. &#147;I think I&#146;m going to buy ahouse.&#148;   He&#146;d be making more money when he went into a private practice.   &#147;Shh!&#148; she reprimanded with stern, superstitious eyes. &#147;Don&#146;t   speak like that out here,&#148; she said, looking down on the street, &#147;il   atrah!&#148; reminding him of the evil someone with an envious heart could cast   through the eye, and he was infuriated. The superstition was based on   a Biblical story about a child and a stone- &#145;Adel couldn&#146;t remember   the details, and he didn&#146;t want to. He hated the fact that his sister   believed in it. She even attributed Mina&#146;s death to the evil eye.   She suspected Sousan, the butcher&#146;s wife. Her husband had sold Mina   bad meat, and she had gone to get her money back. Sousan refused, and   the two women argued. Mina vowed that she would never buy from them again.   The next morning she didn&#146;t wake from sleep. Mary burst into tears   again when she finished whispering the story. &#145;Adel couldn&#146;t   bring himself to comfort her. It was tooridiculous. She was a diabetic!   he thought, though the cause of death could not be confirmed. The church   would not permit any cutting of the body; it would have to be buried as soon   as possible. That&#146;s why he had had to rush home on the day of death.   He had to drop everything in America to come endure this crazy night, to grieve   before the body decayed. She had nothing to envy! he thought, still seething.   But he didn&#146;t argue. It would be in vain.     The priests arrived in the morning to walk the body out of the house. They followed   six policemen in the procession to the church wearing black stoles and chanting   the Three Holies: &#147;Remember me, O Lord, when Thou has come to Thy kingdom&#148;.   After them were the deacons and the acolytes in white and then the carpet of   mercy, carried at the corners by four distinguished women. Finally, &#145;Adel,   Saad, and two of Saad&#146;s best friends carried the coffin before the rest   of the entourage.   On this solemn walk along the Corniche from Azarita to Sporting, &#145;Adel   finally saw Alexandria again. To one side the city looked as it always   had- its ancient arm, loaded with the structures of civilization, curved out   to the old fort that marked in the distance what neither the Arabs nor the Allies   had torn down. The sea was shimmering the high August light, splashing   up sides of ships and the rocky shore, beating baptism into steel and stone.   The street side was changed. When &#145;Adel had left, it bore the ruins   of Faruq- shiny signs that read Italian and Greek, naming vacant caf&eacute;s,   bright striped awnings shading the ghosts of the wealthy and the foreign savoring   smooth, strong coffee, pulp of guava and mango, apricots dried in Syrian sun,   sheer leaves of philo, feta, olive, the pastry art of Paris. He returned   to find it littered with the venders and the beggars that the open market was   starving, the souls Egypt had lost with the Sinai.     &#145;Adel relieved himself of the load of Mina&#146;s body on the front threshold   of the St. George church in Sporting and sat with the men on the left side of   the sanctuary. Most of them matched the dresses of the women with black   ties and sunglasses. In the center, a portrait of Mina was mounted on   a wooden cross, obstructing a painting of the Virgin. Abouna Girgius recited   the prayer of thanksgiving and then the cantor chanted the prayer for the dead.   The blind man held the vowels, quivering on the soul of language as if he would   never let go. &#145;Adel had never learned Coptic- it was ancient, useless,   and yet he felt the prayer in his heart. It was patience, devotion- the   sound of the martyred church, and the low, solemn tones that only memory could   hold took him took him back to the temples the monks lit after Mark. They   had made their own tongue from what was there and what had come and kept it   all the way from Aigyptos to Copt, through Europe and the Arabs .   The holy father opened the casket and put aside the lid that had been strewn   with flowers and sprinkled with rose water. He then scattered dust on   the body, making Mina&#146;s blue silk dress as dingy as the grieving robes,   covering the jewels her sister had packed in, and saying, &#147;from dust, and   unto dust shalt thou return&#148;. Finally, the deacons carried the coffin   three times around the church while the choir chanted the Three Holies.   The cantor beat the rhythm on his knee with one hand and showed them the melody   with the other. Some of the singers cupped their ears, straining to hear.     The congregation rose to touch the hands of Saad, &#145;Adel, and Mary.   They were the chief mourners, and the brothers were almost through. Soon   Saad would resume his busy life at the clinic, and &#145;Adel would return to   America. But Mary would mourn for a year. She would wear black and   no jewelry, go only to the cemetery on feast days, and wail with women on everyholiday.   For the first forty days she would not leave the house, but stay in and sing   her sorrow, long and low and slow, to the streets. With her sister gone   and grieved she would be free to marry. But she was too tired, and &#145;Adel   knew it. Saad would have to stay with her.        At the cemetery   the last legs of the family stood among the holy men and their dearest friends.   Abouna Girgius sealed the coffin, saying a final blessing. The brothers   lifted Mina to the family vault and slid her in next to their mother.   There were inscriptions also for the father who was laid in Asyut below his   parents, his brothers and sisters, and the infant corpse of his first son.        Those who   were left returned to the apartment in Azarita to eat for the first time since   the death. &#145;Adel found his brother smoking his pipe alone on the   balcony. &#147;Izzayak, ya huya?&#148; he said as he stepped out to join   him. It was their first chance to talk.      &#147;Ana   taban,&#148; said Saad, looking out at the sea.      &#147;Wa   ana kamen,&#148; &#145;Adel replied, looking down to the broken sidewalk, the   debris that seemed to be seeping from the earth, filthy cats skulking in the   trash, as if they had reign over the land.   &#147;What happened?&#148; he asked. &#145;Adel had left with the last   Europeans, after the High Dam lit the valley, calmed the flood, when the people   finally had land and nothing to buy. He&#146;d read Nasser in Al-Ahram,   heard him on the radio saying he would throw Israel into the Dead Sea.   He&#146;d seen the empty rockets rolling in the streets of Cairo, pointing north,   the people dancing, the march across the Sinai. Five days later he heard   the fire, hours after salat, over Egypt eating ful medammas. The women   wailed the loss, and later the sad, sudden heart attack. &#147;I thought we   were progressing, liberalizing.&#148; Sadat had kicked the Soviets out   and opened Egypt to the West. There was trade again, and he let anyone   have a passport.   &#147;It&#146;s not working.&#148; The people couldn&#146;t afford   the foreign goods; the university graduates couldn&#146;t find jobs. &#147;And   they&#146;re taking revenge,&#148; he whispered, pointing to the minaret of   the Ibrahimiya mosque, with the gleam of prophecy. Veils were spreading   like ivy from face to face; al-jihad was afoot.   &#147;I thought&#133;&#148;   &#147;You&#146;ve been watching from America! Sure, he&#146;s flying to   Jerusalem talking peace&#133;&#148; &#145;Adel was relieved that Sadat   had the good sense to end the war. It was going to ruin Egypt. &#147;&#133;but   he&#146;s making it a nightmare for us here,&#148; said Saad, wiping his hands   with one another over the iron railing. &#145;Adel didn&#146;t understand.   &#147;He&#146;s trying to please them, to show them how much he believes- did   you know he put Abouna Shenouda in jail?&#148;      &#145;Adel   gasped inside. &#147;Walla?&#148;      &#147;But   that wasn&#146;t enough,&#148; he said. &#147;They&#146;re still killing   us.&#148; The women had resumed their shrieking in the back room, and   &#145;Adel felt the shrill pierce of fear. He had seen the rage.   They had been only boys bullying him in the bathroom. He was bigger than   they, and better- he knew it, and yet he was afraid when he felt their crazed   hatred, spitting him in the face, calling him kafir. He wanted to   save his brother. &#147;Why don&#146;t you follow me back?&#148; he asked.   Saad seemed surprised by the proposal and yet solemn in his response, as if   he&#146;d already deliberated over it. &#147;Mary can&#146;t live in America,&#148;   he said. &#147;She can&#146;t speak English or drive. There is no   kinesa for her. She would be miserable.&#148; He was right, and   &#145;Adel knew that Saad couldn&#146;t leave her, especially not then.   &#147;And besides,&#148; he continued, &#147;I am a king here. I get the   freshest fish, the choicest fruits, the best patch of beach at Ma&#146;moura,   because I am Dr. Saad. I have nothing in America.&#148;   &#147;Yes,&#148; said &#145;Adel, relieved that Saad hadn&#146;t taken his rash   offer. He wouldn&#146;t have been able to stand his sister watching over   him. He couldn&#146;t live like that anymore. &#147;And here you   are king of the trash.&#148;   &#147;And the sea,&#148; he said, looking out again, still proud of his city.   &#147;I&#146;m just looking for a queen.&#148; But he had ruined himself   with that pharmacist. He stayed with her for eight years, until he couldn&#146;t   stand it, and all the good Coptic girls were married.         &#147;Yalla, brothers,&#148;   summoned Mary as she burst out onto the balcony, interrupting their t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te   to tell them that the food was ready.      &#147;Taib!&#148;   snapped Saad, irritated by her abrupt urgency.      &#147;You   see how he treats me?&#148; she said, appealing to &#145;Adel.      &#147;Like   a sheikh&#146;s wife,&#148; he said, poking fun, &#147;a dog.&#148;      &#147;Ekhs   alayk!&#148; she scolded. &#147;And I thought I had my sweet brother back.&#148;      &#147;Only   until the night of peace**,&#148; he said.      &#147;Eh   da!?&#148; she said, both incredulous and outraged. &#147;You must stay   until the fortieth day.&#148; There would be another service for Mina.   It would end the first period of mourning.      &#147;I can&#146;t   stay away from my practice for forty days,&#148; he said, beginning to lose   his temper. She didn&#146;t understand- he had a life in America.   He had a woman and a practice. He was making it on his own; he had gotten   out.      &#147;Not   for your oldest sister?&#148; she said, beginning to cry again.      &#147;Mary,   khalas!&#148; yelled Saad, and she obeyed.        The next   day &#145;Adel went to Abouna Girgius to confess his sins so that he could take   communion on the night of peace, the night he would flee Egypt again.   He faced the father for the first time since he was just barely a man and confessed   the usual: &#147;I have been jealous and proud; I have looked at a woman with   lust.&#148; He did not tell that he had slept with a her. It was   different in America; abouna wouldn&#146;t understand.   Abouna Girgius sat solemn, his eyes cast down, his ear full of sins. This   was the part &#145;Adel hated most- the moment of judgment, the feigned shame,   the thick silence in which he was to repent. He didn&#146;t feel bad.   Any man who didn&#146;t want a woman, money, and prestige would be sick.   He was human.   Finally, the father spoke. &#147;The bond of a lustful eye ties the soul   to the bottom of the grave,&#148; he said. &#147;When your eye is evil,   your body is also full of darkness.&#148; This evil eye again! thought   &#145;Adel, nodding obediently. Even Abouna! &#147;The lamp of the   body is the eye, therefore if your eye us good, your whole body will be full   of light.&#148;(Matthew, 6:22-23) The priest delivered this prescription   with the zeal of revelation. &#145;Adel was exasperated.     On the afternoon of the third day the priests came to send the soul away.   They blessed the dining table and the bread that was to be offered as alms to   the poor and sprinkled all the rooms, now reconstituted with furniture and decorations,   with holy water. They prayed low and softly to soothe the suffering, and   by this solemn holy magic, the family was slowly freed of Mina. &#145;Adel   felt his spirit rise. The shrieking had subsided, and he would leave before   the saddest part- the seventh day, when the women would gather again to sing   their sorrow. He&#146;d heard it when his mother died. After a week   of peace, they were no longer demented by death. The grief had set in.   Their souls were sobbing, and that he couldn&#146;t stand. It was the   sound that broke his heart.     The evening mass was hard. After America, &#145;Adel&#146;s body was no   longer accustomed to fasting, nor fit to stand so long- through the preparation   of the elements, the prayers of thanksgiving, absolution, supplication, the   sermon, the creed, the kiss of peace. By the time the water and wine was   unveiled he had decided: he would marry. And the congregation cried: &#147;Kyrie   Eleison!&#148; He would run back to America and propose to Laura.   The instant the holy bread hit the wine the flesh took the blood. He would   buy a home; she wouldn&#146;t have to nurse anymore. And the priest professed:   &#147;This is in truth the Body and the Blood of Emmanuel our God.&#148;   &#145;Adel joined the people&#146;s response, saying &#147;Amen. I believe.&#148;    The choir praised the Lord with Te Deum Laudamus and cymbals of joy. The   priest prayed silently and partook of the third part of the bread. He   paused for a moment, thinking hard on the holy Sacrament, then raised the chalice,   crossed the air, and spooned the wine into his mouth, marrying the blood to   the flesh. He stopped and thought again, then turned to the congregation.   They all kneeled and cried, &#147;Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the   Lord!&#148; And &#145;Adel went. He would commune. Fasting   and confession had prepared him for it. He circled the altar and received   the bread from the fingers of the father. He would begin his family!   He touched the spoon of wine with his tongue. He would not wither waiting.   In a miracle flash the texture of the bread and the taste of the wine became   one in his mouth. As he savored the Son of man he anticipated the night   of peace. He would announce the marriage, and the women would rejoice   with a clap of ululation. The weight of grief would reel into the trill   of joy.        *Copts refer to the night after someone dies as the night of loneliness   **the seventh night after someone dies, which in Coptic tradition constitutes   a break from the grievous mourning rituals       Glossary of Terms     abouna father, title for a Coptic priest   ahlan wa sahlan welcome   Aigyptos the Greek word for Egyptian   al-atrah the evil eye   boab a doorman   corniche a boardwalk     ekhs alayk shame on you   ful medammus a fava bean dish eaten for breakfast   habibi dear, love, sweetheart   al-Hamdullilah thank God   huya brother   kafir an unbeliever   kaman also   khalas the end; stop; enough   kinesa church   maalaysh it doesn&#146;t matter   okhty sister   oustaz title of respect for a man   saidy a man from Upper Egypt   salaam peace   sheriya street   taban tired   taib yes; ok   walla really!   zagreet an utterance of grief     Back to OJEMH"}]},

By noon the god hangs high,   and she sits in the shade of home,   the trickle-wind of the river grazing   her forearms that strain dicing   spheres of tomato small,   meticulating with knife and hand,   sharp and damp, the girth of fruit   and mother   by the light that told Eratosthenes   the circumference of the world.   She labors to the cusp of night,   working into filling   the parts of beast and field   she&#146;s ground, salted, oiled   and rolls then folds, bit by bit,   the veined linen of the vine,   wrapping the flat-lain leaves   as full of care as Isis   tethered first the head,   then each finger, every toe,   weeping resin to hold   the pieces of her husband.   (a Hebrew mother used   pitch and bitumen glue   to hold a bulrush ark to save   her son from Pharaoh)   While the mummies boil to life   she sits to sew a sleeve,   twining the fabric of the fields   make-shift as the byblus boat   the widow-queen made, frantic   in the swallow-craze of sorrow,   the delta reeds where she split   pressing Horus out at vernal equinox,   that first green break through earth.   She treads the steps of the Holy Family   downstairs to the Hanging Church   and crosses herself on the threshold-   pause of mother, brink of barren,   the last drop she would flood   and grieve like ancient reapers   crying out to the magic goddess   whom the Virgin eclipsed.   At home, under the moon of ancient Jesus,   she builds a pyramid of the flesh she&#146;s made   and offers, steaming live and holy, to her family.   The father sees, by the smoke of priest and tomb,   God blessing bounty.     The Third     Crying and crying in the Cairene alley,   myriad cats cannot hear the adhan;   Things blow up; the peaces cannot hold   al-jihad is loosed upon the world--   the holy strife is loosed, and everywhere   the capacity for compassion wanes;   the best negotiate, while the worst   burst with their bombs, fight stones with fire.   Surely some solution is at hand;   surely Allahu Akhbar is at hand.   Allahu Akhbar! How could He with seed bless them all   as the dust of the earth, the number of stars,   and only some with land? Somewhere in the desert   a spawn with pigeon body and the head of a ram,   a pull crazy and constant as the moon&#146;s,   is flitting its lame wings, while all about it   alight doves spurned into belligerent hawks.   The morning strikes again, but now I know   that half a century of betrayal   was terrorized by a dual promise.   And what sleek flight, its moment mounting fast,   reels back to Jerusalem to land?             Crossing     Forehead, chest, right, left-   I crossed Catholicly at Coptic[1] mass,   sat wrong, with the men,   faced God with no foulard[2]   and had not fasted.     Left shoulder is holy ghost   and right amen, I tried   to train my brain,   to kneel and stand as long as they   and pray.     I did not commune today,   but learned the body order   of father, son, and holy ghost,   amen.------------------------------------------------------------------------   [1] Egyptian orthodox   [2] headscarf; should be worn by Coptic women in church     Ramadan Vigil     Though not present   at the gibbous moon   this laylat al-qadr,   he kneeled and bent and lay,   pressed his head to the carpet to say   allahu akhbar, up and down alone   in waxing foreign light,   while Cairene mosques teemed   at midnight towards Mecca.   As women wandered through   the Gamaliya alleyways,   waddled under platters of fuul   to fill the prayers at Al-Azhar   he told the Jersey City factory:   &#147;fasting is exam for the people&#148;   that 27th day he did not eat.

Was it Menes or the Nile that linked the   lotus and papyrus, put the body to the head?   Past events,                A perfect   pyramid marked the order of man,   the measure of the god in Cheops, how the eye to the northern star can be keener   than the compass.   a record of the past,             Herodotus on the gift of the Nile   people,                  farmers flooded out of the fields from   August to September toiling up the ramps, building to the sky, for twenty years   people that make events.           Akhenaton worshipped only one- the disk of   the rising sun, until the priests of Thebes erased him; Alexander came and conquered.     It is continuous, a continuous process,      Greece flowed into Egypt&#133;   like a stream that flows through time       the Nile fed Rome;   and goes back to ancient times      Thutmose tombed first in the rock of   before any written record.           the valley.

The old apartment was black and bare: the beds and couches   had been removed, the carpets reversed, the mirrors and pictures turned to the   walls. Though he had been away for over a decade, the men in the living   room barely stirred to greet him. They were sitting quietly, smoking and   sipping Turkish coffee from black cups with no sugar while their women wailed   from Mina&#146;s bedroom; not even the joy of homecoming should disrupt the   vigil. &#145;Adel walked through solemnly, touched the hand of his older   brother Saad, and sank down to the ottoman beside him. Friends and relatives   had flocked from all over Egypt to grieve with them. There were cousins   who had grown up, uncles who had balded, the boab who&#146;d been guarding that   building for decades, and a host of other familiar faces. They, like the   government, had expected him to return after finishing medical school in London.   He was supposed to come back immediately and serve in the military. But   &#145;Adel had stayed away. From London he crossed the Atlantic on a red   carpet to Philadelphia. In the thick of Vietnam, America needed doctors.   This was his first time home. His Egyptian passport had expired; he was   safe, American.   When Amin, who was one of the long lost faces mourning with the family, realized   who had entered he couldn&#146;t restrain himself and called, &#147;ahlan wa   sahlan, Doctor &#145;Adel!&#148; from across the room, initiating a solemn chorus   of &#147;maalaysh, ya doctor&#148; among the others. As a child, he used   to serve &#145;Adel and his siblings Parisian style pastries and creamed British   tea in their villa in Asyut during the final years of Faruq. Their father   died before the revolution, and the headless family moved to the delta, leaving   both the man and the boy in the last Christian village of the country.   While the boys grew into doctors and the girls into teachers, he fathered six   children and widowed a wife. &#145;Adel didn&#146;t recognize him that   day, but he could tell from his accent that he was a saidy. &#147;Ahlan,   ya oustaz,&#148; he said, acknowledging him with a nod of the head, and the   old man gleamed with gratitude.   &#145;Adel found this spontaneous display of excitement far less offensive than   the shrill zagreet of lamentation with which the female guests would announce   themselves at the door, inciting rounds of shrieks from the women in the back.   He was glad he had missed the first outburst of grief at the moment of death,   when even the men were to show their pain. He remembered how terrible   it was when his mother died. His sisters and aunts ran about her bed like   chickens being slaughtered, wailing and screaming, &#147;ya mama! ya okhty!&#148;   to get her to rise and see what sorrow she had caused. He hated to see   them crazy like that, and to have to cry out loud in public. He was relieved   when he and his brother could retreat into the living room while their sisters   washed and dressed the body.   Saad had been in medical school at the time, and &#145;Adel was following in   his footsteps at the University of Alexandria. Despite their orphanage   and age, the men had little privacy or freedom. Mina, the oldest of the   siblings, succeeded her mother as the matriarch of the family, and she was more   tyrannical than any father could have been. They were a good Coptic family,   and they had to maintain their dignified name. She had no problems with   her younger sister, who was incapable of vanity or defiance. Mary didn&#146;t   paint her face or cinch her waist with the leather left from Europe to walk   by the boys at the cinema with theless respectable girls. Most of the   time she was in the home cooking and cleaning up after her brothers, leaving   only to shop and go to church, where she taught the children the about the saints.   She had had a couple of suitors, but she could not engage until her older sister   married, and Mina had rejected the few proposals she had received. She   fancied herself the last pillar of the family: Saad was too immature and selfish   to take control, Mary too meek and fragile, and &#145;Adel was the baby.     As the youngest in the family &#145;Adel had always been the most adored and   the most pampered. He didn&#146;t attend school until the age of twelve   because of his severe asthma, and the sisters would wait on him as if he were   a little king. Even after he grew up they smothered him with attention   and affection, and he bore the burden of being the preferred brother.     Saad had no patience for their meddling and doting. Soon after his mother   died Mina found out that he&#146;d having an affair with a pharmacist.   He couldn&#146;t be carousing around with a young woman to whom he wasn&#146;t   engaged, and she was not suitable for marriage. She was from a Protestant   family of shopkeepers; she smoked in public like a man. Saad denied that   he was involved with her and continued seeing her in secret. Saad was   also drinking a lot- Scotch he&#146;d been getting off of the black market.   &#145;Adel was worried, but he wouldn&#146;t interfere. Egypt was suffocating   both of them, and every little freedom was precious when Nasser was aligned   with the Soviets, when people would disappear in the night and never be heard   from again. He would let his brother have his woman and his whisky, and   he would find his own liberation.   He had a lover in America, where he could look at a woman and like it.   He&#146;d met Laura in the operating room. She was a nurse and beautiful.   She had looked back, her green eyes gleaming, like no Egyptian woman would.   It was simple: there were no secret rendez-vous, no mothers putting their heads   together, making matches.   On the balcony stood a woman and a girl, both wearing shabby indigo robes, on   a break from their frenzy. The tall, strong girl looked wild- her frizzy brown   mane flailing in the Mediterranean breeze, her skin splotched red from having   hit herself. She was Amin&#146;s oldest daughter, and though she had never   met Mina, she was grieving hard like she&#146;d learned when her mother died   deep down in the valley. The little woman was gripping her hand, as if   she needed the savage to hold her up. Her straight black hair hung in   disheveled streams down her meager torso, though she usually kept it tied in   a tight bun. &#145;Adel recognized that humble hunching body as his sister.   He stepped out with dread to greet her. &#147; &#145;Adel!&#148; she screamed   when she saw him, shrill as her grieving, and threw her feeble arms around his   waist. &#147;Al-hamdulilla, habibti, il-hamdulilla!&#148; she said, crying   into the barrel of his chest.   &#147;Ahlan, ya okhty,&#148; he said calmly patting her back.   &#147;You look sick,&#148; she said, still clutching him, &#147;there is no   one to take care of you over there.&#148;   But there was. He was practically living with Laura. &#147;I&#146;m   fine, ya okhty,&#148; he said. &#147;I think I&#146;m going to buy ahouse.&#148;   He&#146;d be making more money when he went into a private practice.   &#147;Shh!&#148; she reprimanded with stern, superstitious eyes. &#147;Don&#146;t   speak like that out here,&#148; she said, looking down on the street, &#147;il   atrah!&#148; reminding him of the evil someone with an envious heart could cast   through the eye, and he was infuriated. The superstition was based on   a Biblical story about a child and a stone- &#145;Adel couldn&#146;t remember   the details, and he didn&#146;t want to. He hated the fact that his sister   believed in it. She even attributed Mina&#146;s death to the evil eye.   She suspected Sousan, the butcher&#146;s wife. Her husband had sold Mina   bad meat, and she had gone to get her money back. Sousan refused, and   the two women argued. Mina vowed that she would never buy from them again.   The next morning she didn&#146;t wake from sleep. Mary burst into tears   again when she finished whispering the story. &#145;Adel couldn&#146;t   bring himself to comfort her. It was tooridiculous. She was a diabetic!   he thought, though the cause of death could not be confirmed. The church   would not permit any cutting of the body; it would have to be buried as soon   as possible. That&#146;s why he had had to rush home on the day of death.   He had to drop everything in America to come endure this crazy night, to grieve   before the body decayed. She had nothing to envy! he thought, still seething.   But he didn&#146;t argue. It would be in vain.     The priests arrived in the morning to walk the body out of the house. They followed   six policemen in the procession to the church wearing black stoles and chanting   the Three Holies: &#147;Remember me, O Lord, when Thou has come to Thy kingdom&#148;.   After them were the deacons and the acolytes in white and then the carpet of   mercy, carried at the corners by four distinguished women. Finally, &#145;Adel,   Saad, and two of Saad&#146;s best friends carried the coffin before the rest   of the entourage.   On this solemn walk along the Corniche from Azarita to Sporting, &#145;Adel   finally saw Alexandria again. To one side the city looked as it always   had- its ancient arm, loaded with the structures of civilization, curved out   to the old fort that marked in the distance what neither the Arabs nor the Allies   had torn down. The sea was shimmering the high August light, splashing   up sides of ships and the rocky shore, beating baptism into steel and stone.   The street side was changed. When &#145;Adel had left, it bore the ruins   of Faruq- shiny signs that read Italian and Greek, naming vacant caf&eacute;s,   bright striped awnings shading the ghosts of the wealthy and the foreign savoring   smooth, strong coffee, pulp of guava and mango, apricots dried in Syrian sun,   sheer leaves of philo, feta, olive, the pastry art of Paris. He returned   to find it littered with the venders and the beggars that the open market was   starving, the souls Egypt had lost with the Sinai.     &#145;Adel relieved himself of the load of Mina&#146;s body on the front threshold   of the St. George church in Sporting and sat with the men on the left side of   the sanctuary. Most of them matched the dresses of the women with black   ties and sunglasses. In the center, a portrait of Mina was mounted on   a wooden cross, obstructing a painting of the Virgin. Abouna Girgius recited   the prayer of thanksgiving and then the cantor chanted the prayer for the dead.   The blind man held the vowels, quivering on the soul of language as if he would   never let go. &#145;Adel had never learned Coptic- it was ancient, useless,   and yet he felt the prayer in his heart. It was patience, devotion- the   sound of the martyred church, and the low, solemn tones that only memory could   hold took him took him back to the temples the monks lit after Mark. They   had made their own tongue from what was there and what had come and kept it   all the way from Aigyptos to Copt, through Europe and the Arabs .   The holy father opened the casket and put aside the lid that had been strewn   with flowers and sprinkled with rose water. He then scattered dust on   the body, making Mina&#146;s blue silk dress as dingy as the grieving robes,   covering the jewels her sister had packed in, and saying, &#147;from dust, and   unto dust shalt thou return&#148;. Finally, the deacons carried the coffin   three times around the church while the choir chanted the Three Holies.   The cantor beat the rhythm on his knee with one hand and showed them the melody   with the other. Some of the singers cupped their ears, straining to hear.     The congregation rose to touch the hands of Saad, &#145;Adel, and Mary.   They were the chief mourners, and the brothers were almost through. Soon   Saad would resume his busy life at the clinic, and &#145;Adel would return to   America. But Mary would mourn for a year. She would wear black and   no jewelry, go only to the cemetery on feast days, and wail with women on everyholiday.   For the first forty days she would not leave the house, but stay in and sing   her sorrow, long and low and slow, to the streets. With her sister gone   and grieved she would be free to marry. But she was too tired, and &#145;Adel   knew it. Saad would have to stay with her.        At the cemetery   the last legs of the family stood among the holy men and their dearest friends.   Abouna Girgius sealed the coffin, saying a final blessing. The brothers   lifted Mina to the family vault and slid her in next to their mother.   There were inscriptions also for the father who was laid in Asyut below his   parents, his brothers and sisters, and the infant corpse of his first son.        Those who   were left returned to the apartment in Azarita to eat for the first time since   the death. &#145;Adel found his brother smoking his pipe alone on the   balcony. &#147;Izzayak, ya huya?&#148; he said as he stepped out to join   him. It was their first chance to talk.      &#147;Ana   taban,&#148; said Saad, looking out at the sea.      &#147;Wa   ana kamen,&#148; &#145;Adel replied, looking down to the broken sidewalk, the   debris that seemed to be seeping from the earth, filthy cats skulking in the   trash, as if they had reign over the land.   &#147;What happened?&#148; he asked. &#145;Adel had left with the last   Europeans, after the High Dam lit the valley, calmed the flood, when the people   finally had land and nothing to buy. He&#146;d read Nasser in Al-Ahram,   heard him on the radio saying he would throw Israel into the Dead Sea.   He&#146;d seen the empty rockets rolling in the streets of Cairo, pointing north,   the people dancing, the march across the Sinai. Five days later he heard   the fire, hours after salat, over Egypt eating ful medammas. The women   wailed the loss, and later the sad, sudden heart attack. &#147;I thought we   were progressing, liberalizing.&#148; Sadat had kicked the Soviets out   and opened Egypt to the West. There was trade again, and he let anyone   have a passport.   &#147;It&#146;s not working.&#148; The people couldn&#146;t afford   the foreign goods; the university graduates couldn&#146;t find jobs. &#147;And   they&#146;re taking revenge,&#148; he whispered, pointing to the minaret of   the Ibrahimiya mosque, with the gleam of prophecy. Veils were spreading   like ivy from face to face; al-jihad was afoot.   &#147;I thought&#133;&#148;   &#147;You&#146;ve been watching from America! Sure, he&#146;s flying to   Jerusalem talking peace&#133;&#148; &#145;Adel was relieved that Sadat   had the good sense to end the war. It was going to ruin Egypt. &#147;&#133;but   he&#146;s making it a nightmare for us here,&#148; said Saad, wiping his hands   with one another over the iron railing. &#145;Adel didn&#146;t understand.   &#147;He&#146;s trying to please them, to show them how much he believes- did   you know he put Abouna Shenouda in jail?&#148;      &#145;Adel   gasped inside. &#147;Walla?&#148;      &#147;But   that wasn&#146;t enough,&#148; he said. &#147;They&#146;re still killing   us.&#148; The women had resumed their shrieking in the back room, and   &#145;Adel felt the shrill pierce of fear. He had seen the rage.   They had been only boys bullying him in the bathroom. He was bigger than   they, and better- he knew it, and yet he was afraid when he felt their crazed   hatred, spitting him in the face, calling him kafir. He wanted to   save his brother. &#147;Why don&#146;t you follow me back?&#148; he asked.   Saad seemed surprised by the proposal and yet solemn in his response, as if   he&#146;d already deliberated over it. &#147;Mary can&#146;t live in America,&#148;   he said. &#147;She can&#146;t speak English or drive. There is no   kinesa for her. She would be miserable.&#148; He was right, and   &#145;Adel knew that Saad couldn&#146;t leave her, especially not then.   &#147;And besides,&#148; he continued, &#147;I am a king here. I get the   freshest fish, the choicest fruits, the best patch of beach at Ma&#146;moura,   because I am Dr. Saad. I have nothing in America.&#148;   &#147;Yes,&#148; said &#145;Adel, relieved that Saad hadn&#146;t taken his rash   offer. He wouldn&#146;t have been able to stand his sister watching over   him. He couldn&#146;t live like that anymore. &#147;And here you   are king of the trash.&#148;   &#147;And the sea,&#148; he said, looking out again, still proud of his city.   &#147;I&#146;m just looking for a queen.&#148; But he had ruined himself   with that pharmacist. He stayed with her for eight years, until he couldn&#146;t   stand it, and all the good Coptic girls were married.         &#147;Yalla, brothers,&#148;   summoned Mary as she burst out onto the balcony, interrupting their t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te   to tell them that the food was ready.      &#147;Taib!&#148;   snapped Saad, irritated by her abrupt urgency.      &#147;You   see how he treats me?&#148; she said, appealing to &#145;Adel.      &#147;Like   a sheikh&#146;s wife,&#148; he said, poking fun, &#147;a dog.&#148;      &#147;Ekhs   alayk!&#148; she scolded. &#147;And I thought I had my sweet brother back.&#148;      &#147;Only   until the night of peace**,&#148; he said.      &#147;Eh   da!?&#148; she said, both incredulous and outraged. &#147;You must stay   until the fortieth day.&#148; There would be another service for Mina.   It would end the first period of mourning.      &#147;I can&#146;t   stay away from my practice for forty days,&#148; he said, beginning to lose   his temper. She didn&#146;t understand- he had a life in America.   He had a woman and a practice. He was making it on his own; he had gotten   out.      &#147;Not   for your oldest sister?&#148; she said, beginning to cry again.      &#147;Mary,   khalas!&#148; yelled Saad, and she obeyed.        The next   day &#145;Adel went to Abouna Girgius to confess his sins so that he could take   communion on the night of peace, the night he would flee Egypt again.   He faced the father for the first time since he was just barely a man and confessed   the usual: &#147;I have been jealous and proud; I have looked at a woman with   lust.&#148; He did not tell that he had slept with a her. It was   different in America; abouna wouldn&#146;t understand.   Abouna Girgius sat solemn, his eyes cast down, his ear full of sins. This   was the part &#145;Adel hated most- the moment of judgment, the feigned shame,   the thick silence in which he was to repent. He didn&#146;t feel bad.   Any man who didn&#146;t want a woman, money, and prestige would be sick.   He was human.   Finally, the father spoke. &#147;The bond of a lustful eye ties the soul   to the bottom of the grave,&#148; he said. &#147;When your eye is evil,   your body is also full of darkness.&#148; This evil eye again! thought   &#145;Adel, nodding obediently. Even Abouna! &#147;The lamp of the   body is the eye, therefore if your eye us good, your whole body will be full   of light.&#148;(Matthew, 6:22-23) The priest delivered this prescription   with the zeal of revelation. &#145;Adel was exasperated.     On the afternoon of the third day the priests came to send the soul away.   They blessed the dining table and the bread that was to be offered as alms to   the poor and sprinkled all the rooms, now reconstituted with furniture and decorations,   with holy water. They prayed low and softly to soothe the suffering, and   by this solemn holy magic, the family was slowly freed of Mina. &#145;Adel   felt his spirit rise. The shrieking had subsided, and he would leave before   the saddest part- the seventh day, when the women would gather again to sing   their sorrow. He&#146;d heard it when his mother died. After a week   of peace, they were no longer demented by death. The grief had set in.   Their souls were sobbing, and that he couldn&#146;t stand. It was the   sound that broke his heart.     The evening mass was hard. After America, &#145;Adel&#146;s body was no   longer accustomed to fasting, nor fit to stand so long- through the preparation   of the elements, the prayers of thanksgiving, absolution, supplication, the   sermon, the creed, the kiss of peace. By the time the water and wine was   unveiled he had decided: he would marry. And the congregation cried: &#147;Kyrie   Eleison!&#148; He would run back to America and propose to Laura.   The instant the holy bread hit the wine the flesh took the blood. He would   buy a home; she wouldn&#146;t have to nurse anymore. And the priest professed:   &#147;This is in truth the Body and the Blood of Emmanuel our God.&#148;   &#145;Adel joined the people&#146;s response, saying &#147;Amen. I believe.&#148;    The choir praised the Lord with Te Deum Laudamus and cymbals of joy. The   priest prayed silently and partook of the third part of the bread. He   paused for a moment, thinking hard on the holy Sacrament, then raised the chalice,   crossed the air, and spooned the wine into his mouth, marrying the blood to   the flesh. He stopped and thought again, then turned to the congregation.   They all kneeled and cried, &#147;Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the   Lord!&#148; And &#145;Adel went. He would commune. Fasting   and confession had prepared him for it. He circled the altar and received   the bread from the fingers of the father. He would begin his family!   He touched the spoon of wine with his tongue. He would not wither waiting.   In a miracle flash the texture of the bread and the taste of the wine became   one in his mouth. As he savored the Son of man he anticipated the night   of peace. He would announce the marriage, and the women would rejoice   with a clap of ululation. The weight of grief would reel into the trill   of joy.        *Copts refer to the night after someone dies as the night of loneliness   **the seventh night after someone dies, which in Coptic tradition constitutes   a break from the grievous mourning rituals       Glossary of Terms     abouna father, title for a Coptic priest   ahlan wa sahlan welcome   Aigyptos the Greek word for Egyptian   al-atrah the evil eye   boab a doorman   corniche a boardwalk     ekhs alayk shame on you   ful medammus a fava bean dish eaten for breakfast   habibi dear, love, sweetheart   al-Hamdullilah thank God   huya brother   kafir an unbeliever   kaman also   khalas the end; stop; enough   kinesa church   maalaysh it doesn&#146;t matter   okhty sister   oustaz title of respect for a man   saidy a man from Upper Egypt   salaam peace   sheriya street   taban tired   taib yes; ok   walla really!   zagreet an utterance of grief     Back to OJEMH"}, {"content": "Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian Studies | New York University                               NEW YORK UNIVERSITY       ARTS AND SCIENCE       COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE       GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE                                                                    Home     People       Graduate Program       Events       Resources       Affiliated Departments and Programs at NYU                           The Program in Ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian Studies grants MA and PhD degrees as preparation for careers in research, teaching, and museum work in the areas of Egypt, Mesopotamia, or the northern Levant. Faculty members are drawn from several departments and institutes of New York University and approach the region from a wide variety of disciplines and perspectives.      Students in the program will concentrate on the ancient Near East or Egypt, but the study of neighboring ancient cultures and comparative work is strongly encouraged, facilitated by NYU's impressive faculty in Classics and Hebrew & Judaic Studies. The small size of the program means that students will receive individual guidance in tailoring their programs specifically to their needs and interests, but will have access to the tremendous resources of the university and the city of New York.           Applications for Fall 2015 are due no later than January 4, 2015. Note that the program will only be accepting MA applications for Fall 2015; no fellowships for the doctoral program have been allocated for this admissions cycle, and therefore no applications for the PhD program can be accepted .
