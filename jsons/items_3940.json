The study, which appears in the Journal of Neuroscience , provides fresh evidence on the brain\u2019s role in communication.     \u201cOur findings show that the brains of both speakers and listeners take language predictability into account, resulting in more similar brain activity patterns between the two,\u201d says Suzanne Dikker, the study\u2019s lead author and a post-doctoral researcher in New York University\u2019s Department of Psychology and Utrecht University. \u201cCrucially, this happens even before a sentence is spoken and heard.\u201d   \u201cA lot of what we've learned about language and the brain has been from controlled laboratory tests that tend to look at language in the abstract\u2014you get a string of words or you hear one word at a time,\u201d adds Jason Zevin, an associate professor of psychology and linguistics at the University of Southern California and one of the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cThey\u2019re not so much about communication, but about the structure of language. The current experiment is really about how we use language to express common ground or share our understanding of an event with someone else.\u201d    The study\u2019s other authors were Lauren Silbert, a recent PhD graduate from Princeton University, and Uri Hasson, an assistant professor in Princeton\u2019s Department of Psychology.   Traditionally, it was thought that our brains always process the world around us from the \u201cbottom up\u201d\u2014when we hear someone speak, our auditory cortex first processes the sounds, and then other areas in the brain put those sounds together into words and then sentences and larger discourse units. From here, we derive meaning and an understanding of the content of what is said to us.   However, in recent years, many neuroscientists have shifted to a \u201ctop-down\u201d view of the brain, which they now see as a \u201cprediction machine\u201d: We are constantly anticipating events in the world around us so that we can respond to them quickly and accurately. For example, we can predict words and sounds based on context\u2014and our brain takes advantage of this. For instance, when we hear \u201cGrass is\u2026\u201d we can easily predict \u201cgreen.\u201d   What\u2019s less understood is how this predictability might affect the speaker\u2019s brain, or even the interaction between speakers and listeners.   In the Journal of Neuroscience study, the researchers collected brain responses from a speaker while she described images that she had viewed. These images varied in terms of likely predictability for a specific description. For instance, one image showed a penguin hugging a star (a relatively easy image in which to predict a speaker\u2019s description). However, another image depicted a guitar stirring a bicycle tire submerged in a boiling pot of water\u2014a picture that is much less likely to yield a predictable description: Is it \u201ca guitar cooking a tire,\u201d \u201ca guitar boiling a wheel,\u201d or \u201ca guitar stirring a bike\u201d?   Then, another group of subjects listened to those descriptions while viewing the same images. During this period, the researchers monitored the subjects\u2019 brain activity.   When comparing the speaker\u2019s brain responses directly to the listeners\u2019 brain responses, they found that activity patterns in brain areas where spoken words are processed were more similar between the listeners and the speaker when the listeners could predict what the speaker was going to say.   When listeners can predict what a speaker is going to say, the authors suggest, their brains take advantage of this by sending a signal to their auditory cortex that it can expect sound patterns corresponding to predicted words (e.g., \u201cgreen\u201d while hearing \u201cgrass is...\u201d). Interestingly, they add, the speaker's brain is showing a similar effect as she is planning what she will say: brain activity in her auditory language areas is affected by how predictable her utterance will be for her listeners.     \u201cIn addition to facilitating rapid and accurate processing of the world around us, the predictive power of our brains might play an important role in human communication,\u201d notes Dikker, who conducted some of the research as a post-doctoral fellow at Weill Cornell Medical College\u2019s Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology. \u201cDuring conversation, we adapt our speech rate and word choices to each other\u2014for example, when explaining science to a child as opposed to a fellow scientist\u2014and these processes are governed by our brains, which correspondingly align to each other.\u201d   This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (P01-HD001994, R01-MH094480), Chinese Academy of Sciences Fellowships for Young International Scientists (2012Y1SA0004), and a Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research Innovation Scheme Veni Grant (275-89-018).

Hear names like Scooby Doo, Spice, and K2 in a high school and you can be pretty sure students aren\u2019t talking about their favorite entertainers.   Synthetic cannabinoids, designed to have similar effects to those of cannabis and marketed under such names, are often sold as a legal alternative to marijuana, though they are more harmful. Synthetics have been linked to 11,561 U.S. reports of poisonings between January and 2009 and April 2011, and 11.4% of high school seniors reported using them in 2011. Which teenagers are most likely to try them? NYU\u2019s Center for Drug Use and HIV Research found that those most at risk are male, white, go out 3 to 4 times a week, use other substances, are regular smokers, use natural marijuana regularly, or have been lifetime users of a different illicit drug.    The draw? Avoiding arrest.     Location Location Location   Would you buy an iPhone from the wrong side of the tracks?   Residents of lower-income areas are often the most hard-pressed for extra cash\u2014and yet when it comes selling goods online, their very neighborhoods can work to stigmatize them as untrustworthy, researchers in NYU\u2019s department of sociology found .   In their experiment, they evaluated responses to online classified ads for iPhone 5\u2019s in 12 cities\u2014placed in various neighborhoods determined to be advantaged or disadvantaged based on census data. All other factors being equal, the ads originating from the disadvantaged neighborhoods received 16 percent fewer responses than did those from tonier ones. And the disparity was even greater\u2014about 21 percent fewer responses\u2014for poor neighborhoods that were predominantly black.   It\u2019s yet another example of how perceptions\u2014even false ones\u2014can reinforce disparities in economic opportunity. The rich get richer...     Stop the Presses!   Velcro. Penicillin. The microwave oven.   To that list of famous accidental discoveries we can now add an answer to one of life\u2019s most vexing questions: How many licks does it take to reach the center of a lollipop?   A group of Courant and Florida State University researchers recently came up with an estimate\u2014in the midst of a larger study of how materials change shape and dissolve in water. In the experiment, they immersed hard candies in a current, and found that the \u201csculpture\u201d that emerged as the candy dissolved took on the same shape every time, regardless of the speed of the water flow or the initial shape of the candy.   Their theory about how things shrink and dissolve has applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and for geologists studying erosion.   Oh\u2014and it takes about 1,000 licks.     It Really Is the Thought That Counts   That pricey designer clutch you just picked out for your sister-in-law? Don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not a big hit on Christmas morning, one NYU psychologist warns. She might have preferred a simple, functional tote.   It\u2019s no secret that the holiday season can trigger major stress over finding the perfect gift for loved ones. But Yaacov Trope\u2019s research suggests it\u2019s overthinking that really gets us into trouble: Gift givers tend to obsess over finding fancy presents, when it turns out that most people would rather receive something practical.   That means, for example, that an Italian food lover would choose a gift certificate to a medium-rated Italian restaurant five minutes from her home over one to a top-rated place an hour away\u2014something to keep in mind when tackling your shopping list this year.

You drink from it, look through it, and sometimes even cut your foot on it\u2014but what do you really know about glass?   For years the material\u2014and how it transforms from solid to liquid\u2014has puzzled scientists, because its particles are disorganized compared to those in metals.   Glass is a colloid, which means it\u2019s made up of tiny particles that wiggle a little in place. But with all that wiggling, how does it remain solid?   NYU researchers have crafted a theory \u2014based on observations dating back to James C. Maxwell in the 19th century\u2014that the particles move in a coordinated way, engaging in a kind of microscopic dance party within a structure just strong enough to contain the frenzy.   Such research could have far-reaching implications, as colloids are also found in milk, paint, and gelatin\u2014and our blood.     Strength in Numbers   In 2011, the U.S. government discontinued its color-coded system alerting Americans to the terrorist threat level facing the country. Since its implementation in 2002, the warning scale had never dropped below \u201cyellow\u201d\u2014a 3 out of 5 in terms of danger.   But many of us still worry about terrorism\u2014and our perceptions of risk can vary depending on how close we feel to our fellow Americans, Steinhardt\u2019s Rezarta Bilali found .   She surveyed 147 university students on whether they perceived Americans to be similar to each other or different, and then showed them a (fake) newspaper article about a national security risk. Those who believed Americans are unlike each other were more likely to perceive a heightened threat when they read the article\u2014and more likely to support the U.S.\u2019s involvement in the war in Iraq.

Beyond that first awkward \u201cbirds-and-bees\u201d lecture, many families aren\u2019t eager to talk about sex\u2014at least not in detail, a survey of parents and children (aged 9-21) by Planned Parenthood and NYU\u2019s Silver School found.   Of those polled, one in five parents had never talked specifically about birth control methods or strategies for saying no to sex, and 30% had offered no guidance on where to go for reproductive health care. For parents of 15- to 21-year-olds, 91% knew that their kids were having sexual intercourse, but just 40% were informed that their children were engaging in oral sex.    And though 61% of parents said people should hold off on sex until they\u2019re in a serious relationship, only 52% had actually told their kids that.   Time for The Talk, Part II?     See No Evil, Hear No Evil     For a child, is there anything worse than watching Mom and Dad fight?   Here\u2019s yet another reason frazzled parents should seek help in dealing with relationship anger and stress:   A study tracking 1,025 children found that adversity at home had varying effects on their ability to recognize and control feelings such as fear and sadness. In an emotions labeling task administered to the children just before their fifth birthday, Steinhardt\u2019s C. Cybele Raver and colleagues found that those who\u2019d been exposed to physical aggression between parents performed poorly, whereas\u2014surprisingly\u2014children who\u2019d witnessed only verbal aggression displayed a greater understanding of different emotions.   But knowledge isn\u2019t always power. Both types of clashes between parents were linked to kids\u2019 difficulty in regulating their own negative feelings\u2014which could put them at risk for anxiety and depression later on.     Tweeting Across the Aisle     Another election cycle, another chance for pundits to herald the increased polarization of politics in our brave new (digital) world: With the internet, the argument goes, we\u2019ve built ourselves echo chambers\u2014online communities where we engage with like-minded peers in discussions that only reinforce what we already believe.   Old news, right?   Not so fast, cautions NYU\u2019s Pablo Barber\u00e1. In a study of millions of social media users in Germany, Spain, and the U.S., he found that platforms like Twitter actually reduce polarization by exposing people to political messages they wouldn\u2019t otherwise encounter. That\u2019s because our social networks include not just BFFs, but also people with whom we have only \u201cweak ties\u201d\u2014and wouldn\u2019t choose to chat politics with offline.   Something to consider before \u201cunfriending\u201d a zealous acquaintance for one too many rants in your Facebook newsfeed.     Shy Is Not Stupid     True, but unfair: Teachers often neglect the quiet kid in the corner in favor of the motormouth in the front row. Because of this, shy children are at risk for poor academic achievement. But a new Steinhardt study found a way to help these overlooked pupils reach their full potential\u2014without pressuring them to \u201ccome out of their shell.\u201d   Enter the INSIGHTS into Children\u2019s Temperament intervention, which focuses on supporting personality differences instead of trying to change them. In a study of nearly 350 children transitioning from kindergarten to first grade, half the students participated in INSIGHT, and half attended a traditional after-school reading program.    While math and critical thinking skills of shy children of the second group declined, these skills improved in shy children of the first group\u2014 proving that being shy does not have to be a disadvantage.     Video Killed Objectivity     You\u2019d think that video evidence used in court would help everybody to see the objective truth, right? Not so fast. It turns out that everyday prejudices aren\u2019t so easily shed: A series of experiments by NYU psychologists and colleagues from the Yale School of Law showed that instead of challenging our biases, video evidence might in fact enhance them.    In one, 152 participants watched videos of ambiguous altercations between a police officer and a civilian, while researchers tracked their eye movements. A survey determined how connected participants felt to the social group of each officer.   Those who did not identify with the police officer suggested harsher punishments for his behavior. The discrepancy was also linked to how much participants fixed their gaze on each officer: The more they looked, the more their established beliefs about police misconduct were confirmed.     Risky Business     Play it safe, or go all in? Your gambling style might be determined by your brain structure, a study by NYU\u2019s Paul Glimcher and colleagues found. Specifically, it\u2019s a part of the parietal cortex that matters: Those with a larger volume in this part of the brain proved more willing to take more risks than those with a smaller volume there.   In the study, a few dozen young adults chose between monetary lotteries that varied in their level of risk while researchers conducted MRI scans on their brains. This is the first time brain structure has been used to explain financial decisions.   The same research team has also shown that as the parietal cortex thins with age, people become more likely to avoid risks\u2014something to keep in mind next time you sit down to a poker game with Grandma.     Nurses in Flight   As anyone who\u2019s ever suffered first-day-of-school or work jitters knows, starting a new gig can be stressful. That\u2019s especially true in demanding medical fields, survey data from The RN Work Project, a 10-year longitudinal study of nurses, suggests. Researchers recently discovered that around 17.5 percent of newly licensed RNs leave their first job within a year, and a whopping 33.5 percent leave within two years.   All the shuffling can cost a large hospital as much as $6.4 million, and can even impact patient care, studies indicate, leading to increases in bedsores and falls.   Still, not all such turnover is bad: There\u2019s a big difference between an ineffective nurse washing out and a highly competent one quitting, of course. And a nurse who leaves one post may do so to take up a similar one\u2014sometimes within the same hospital.     What Lies Beneath   Nearly half a mile below the Antarctic ice sheet, there\u2019s a hidden lake. And in that lake, there\u2019s life\u2014whole ecosystems, in fact, a team of researchers (including Courant\u2019s Knut Christianson) recently revealed in a paper for the journal Nature.   Don\u2019t picture ducklings and swans, though: The diverse community of critters the scientists found consists of microbes that can mine rocks for energy and use CO 2 as their source of carbon.   With funding from the National Science Foundation, a team of explorers used a hot-water drill to reach 2,600 feet down and retrieve water samples from Antarctica\u2019s Lake Whillans last year. The subsequent discovery of organisms in those samples raises questions about what might be lurking in the other 400 lakes and numerous rivers under Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet\u2014and on other frozen planets in our solar system and beyond.     Patience is a Virtue\u2014and Prevents Scarring!   Salicylic acid. Benzoyl peroxide. Toothpaste. Egg whites. Whatever you smeared on your face in an effort to banish pimples during your teen years, you probably forgot one essential ingredient: time.   Take it from Seth J. Orlow, an NYU dermatologist who\u2019s been treating adolescent acne for more than 25 years: There\u2019s still no overnight miracle cure\u2014though medications do work, provided you have patience. (That means not giving up when you don\u2019t see improvement immediately\u2014a concept his hormone-addled patients tend to have trouble with.)   Orlow is also in the business of mythbusting: No, you can\u2019t scrub acne away, he says. And stop blaming your diet.   Another piece of advice? Leave those zits alone! \u201cI fervently encourage all of my acne patients not to pick at their lesions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to avoid scarring, not foster it.\u201d     Hackers, Do Your Worst     That clever password you just devised for online banking? It won\u2019t protect you if your financial institution\u2019s database is hacked\u2014a fate that befalls dozens of high profile companies each year. Criminals outmaneuver encryption schemes by intercepting database keys or administrator passwords\u2014and after that it\u2019s just a matter of cracking into individual accounts. With computers that can check a billion six-character combinations per second, thieves can potentially decode about three passwords per hour.   That\u2019s why NYU School of Engineering\u2019s Justin Cappos and colleagues have devised PolyPasswordHasher\u2014a storage method that divides secret information into shares, meaning that to verify any single password, an attacker would have to correctly guess at least three of them simultaneously. In practice, this would take all 900 million computers on Earth working nonstop for longer than 13 billion years. So, you know\u2014don\u2019t panic.      Give a Hug, Help a Brain     Reason no. 20,746 to thank mom for raising you: Her touch isn\u2019t just soothing\u2014it directly shapes a baby\u2019s brain. Scientists have long known that parental bonding plays an important role in neural development, but a group of NYU Langone researchers have become the first to study that process in real time. They watched 100 hours of video of mama rats tending to their young, and compared the footage to brain scans from rat babies, or \u201cpups,\u201d outfitted with miniature wireless transmitters.   The takeaway? Brain wave patterns changed depending on whether the pups were nursing or left alone\u2014and researchers believe such variations caused by nurturing interactions with mom help hard-wire a healthy brain for life. In fact, when mother rats groomed their pups, brain activity spiked by more than 100 percent. (Awww.)     Gateway to Ecstasy   MDMA\u2026E\u2026X\u2014whatever you call it, ecstasy remains popular among adolescents and young adults despite an overall decline in its use since the peak period of the late 1990s and early 2000s. A recent study by NYU researchers found that 4.4% of high school seniors reported using ecstasy within the last year, with boys at particularly high risk for use.   Analyzing data from a survey administered nationwide in 130 schools, they concluded that previous use of other drugs was the biggest predictor of ecstasy use, drowning out other socioeconomic factors. In addition, girls and religious students were at lower odds for use, as were black and Hispanic students and those residing with two parents\u2014unless they were already using other substances.   Money matters, too: Odds of using ecstasy increased for students with a job paying more than $50 per week.       Monkey Match   Gazing into the eyes of a potential mate is a time-honored pastime of lovers everywhere. But what if that ritual also involved checking your partner\u2019s face for differently colored eyebrow patches, ear tufts, and nose spots?   Some types of Old World monkeys use those visual markers, which have evolved over time, to avoid interbreeding with similar species, NYU researchers have found . The anthropologists used facial recognition algorithms to compare 1,400 photographs of guenons\u2014a group of more than two dozen species of monkeys who live side-by-side in the forests of Central and West Africa\u2014to explore differences in their facial features.   The results showed that the face patterns of various guenon species sharing the same territory have evolved to appear distinct from one another, cutting down on the risk of hybridization and infertile offspring.     When Money Isn\u2019t Just Green   No one likes the feeling that there\u2019s not enough money to go around. But a new study by NYU psychologists found that a sense of scarcity can lead to more than penny pinching: In lean economic times, African Americans tend to appear \u201cblacker\u201d to whites.   In one experiment, non-black study participants were asked to view 110 computer-generated images of faces ranging from light- to dark-skinned. Those who\u2019d indicated through survey questions that they believed that \u201cwhen blacks make economic gains, whites lose out economically\u201d had a lower threshold for identifying mixed-race faces as black.   In another, adults randomly selected from a city park were asked to divide up $15 between imaginary people (represented by composite faces) gave significantly less money to the face that looked blacker.   Watch Stephen Colbert\u2019s take on the study and and read more in Time and The Star-Ledger .        Eyes as a Window to...the Brain?   Here\u2019s something you didn\u2019t see coming as a kid who dreamt of flying to the moon: Space travel could give you poor eyesight.   The nerves that move the eyes are very sensitive to changes in pressure in the brain, which could explain why astronauts exposed to elevated pressure in space suffer from visual impairment. Back here on Earth, weaknesses in those nerves can be a symptom of concussion or other traumatic brain injury.   That\u2019s why biotech whizzes at Oculogica, co-founded by Stern grad Robert Ritlop (MBA\u201914) and the School of Medicine\u2019s Uzma Samadani, are developing EyeBox, a diagnostic tool that uses eye tracking to detect problems in the brain.   The National Space Biomedical Research Institute recently funded further development of EyeBox through a $250,000 SMARTCAP grant\u2014used to encourage the development of products to meet a need in space and on Earth.       DNA Origami   Forget paper cranes.   Chemistry professor Nadrian Seeman and colleagues at NYU and the University of Melbourne are practicing the delicate art of manipulating shapes at a much, much smaller scale.   Using DNA origami, which employs two hundred short DNA strands to direct longer strands into forming specific shapes, the researchers created amyloid fibrils\u2014aggregated proteins as strong as spider\u2019s silk\u2014and a tiny nanotube (just one billionth of a meter in diameter) to house them. Their results are published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .   Creating two-dimensional shapes like these on the nanoscale could enhance fiber optics and electronic devices by reducing their size and increasing their speed.   \u201cSmall is so exciting\u2014you can make better structures on the tiniest chemical scales,\u201d Seeman says.     Move Over, Silicon   BREAKING\u2014 The Graduate was indeed ahead of its time, because the future can still be summed up in one word: plastics. The flexible, inexpensive material could one day replace the silicon used in computer and phone processors\u2014and thanks to new research by NYU physicists, that day is closer than ever.   Researchers focused on overcoming one big obstacle to making these plastic devices cheaply: the large amount of energy required to read information stored on them. (The trick is in converting data stored magnetically to light for fiber optic transmission.) In a recent experiment, they managed to transfer information between a magnet and an organic light-emitting diode, without electrical current flowing between the two.   The catch? Their device wasn\u2019t petite\u2014so the technology will have to be miniaturized before it can make its way into our favorite mobile gadgets.     Going With the Flow?   Leonardo da Vinci was onto something when he noticed that water falling into a pond created eddies of motion. The phenomenon he observed in the swirling currents is what scientists call turbulence\u2014and it remains mysterious to physicists and mathematicians even today.   Turbulence is all around us: the efficiency of a jet engine, for example, depends on it. But other forms of this kind of fluid motion are much less familiar. NYU\u2019s Katepalli Sreenivasan is part of a team of researchers studying quantum turbulence\u2014the very chaotic motion of fluids at temperatures close to zero. These fluids are unlike ordinary air or water in that there\u2019s no resistance to hinder their flow.   By studying these differences\u2014between quantum and classical turbulence\u2014Sreenivasan and colleagues could uncover phenomena not yet known to physics. Talk about making waves!     When Stars Die   They do not go gentle into that good night! Picture stripped-envelope supernovae as brilliant as a billion suns and gamma-ray bursts that launch particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Both are symptoms of stellar collapse, but astronomers so far have been unable to figure out which stars produce these types of explosions on their way out.   That\u2019s where NYU physicist Maryam Modjaz comes in. She\u2019s won a 5-year, $500,000 NSF CAREER Award for a scientific investigative method she calls \u201cstellar forensics.\u201d By studying the mass and metallicity (the proportion of matter made of elements other than hydrogen and helium) of the celestial habitats of the explosions, her research team will be able to deduce the makeup of the stars producing the big outbursts. And that , in turn, could help trace the chemical history of the universe.     Snapshots from the Mind\u2019s Eye     Who needs a police-department sketch artist when scientists can pluck a suspect\u2019s face directly from the mind of an eyewitness (no psychic required!)?   Thanks to advances in fMRI technology, a trio of researchers including NYU\u2019s Brice Kuhl are honing the art of mindreading. In a recent study , the scientists scanned the brains of six volunteers as they viewed images of 300 different \u201ctraining\u201d faces, and then repeated the process with 30 new faces. By comparing these new scans to the previous 300, the researchers were able to produce recognizable images of the faces as they appeared in volunteers\u2019 minds.   The pictures aren\u2019t perfect yet, but a more advanced version of this method could one day be used to help understand how autistic children respond to faces, to assess racial prejudice, or even to recreate faces from dreams.   Read more in the Wall Street Journal .       We Still Love You, BU   Alarming, though not especially surprising: People tend to dehumanize members of groups they don\u2019t belong to. NYU and Harvard researchers recently showed undergrads pictures of human faces that had been morphed together with inanimate objects (like dolls or statues). The students were more likely to deem a hybrid image as \u201chaving a mind\u201d if it was labeled as belonging to their \u201cin-group.\u201d   So a Democrat might imagine a Republican to be mindless, unless\u2014and here\u2019s the new wrinkle\u2014the Democrat views the Republican as threatening, the researchers found. NYU students who identified strongly with their school were more likely to perceive faces labeled as Boston University students as rivals, and were therefore more likely than other NYU students to report that the BU students had minds. The same held for ardent political party supporters who viewed their adversaries as threatening.     Waiting for the Phone to Ring   Even women seeking to date men who\u2019ll treat them as equals can be shy to ask those guys out, a new study by NYU sociologist Ellen Lamont found. She interviewed 38 female college graduates\u2014average age 31\u2014who described their ideal relationship as one in which partners equally shared economic, housework, and childcare responsibilities. Three quarters of those who had or wanted children said they had not interrupted or would not interrupt their careers to become stay-at-home moms.   But despite their egalitarian ideals, the women clung to traditional gender roles in the realm of dating: They said that men are responsible for asking women out, paying for dates, and proposing marriage. Many feared rejection when pursuing relationships, and expressed a preference for being pursued and desired. Take notice, rom-com screenwriters!       Tomes for Tots?   Sure, your baby could be the next great Tolstoy scholar\u2014but don\u2019t count on him to crack open War and Peace just yet. A Steinhardt study has busted the myth that, with a little help from educational DVDs and flashcards, infants can learn to read.   The researchers studied 117 infants aged nine to 18 months, some of whom received a baby media product\u2014DVDs, flashcards, or flipbooks\u2014to be used daily for seven months.   When the babies who\u2019d been given the educational materials were tested on their capacity to recognize letter names, letter sounds, and words by sight, they scored just as poorly as those in the control group, who hadn\u2019t been \u201cstudying.\u201d   The products did have one profound effect\u2014on parents, who in exit interviews expressed the belief that their precocious progeny were well on their way to literacy.     A Safer Fix   Nine percent of new HIV infections originate from drug use, and 70 to 77 percent of people who inject drugs have hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That\u2019s why researchers at NYU\u2019s Center for Drug Use and HIV Research have studied the behaviors of people who\u2019ve injected drugs for 8 to 15 years and not contracted these diseases.   Aiming to reduce disease transmission among all addicts, colleagues from the National Development Research Institutes drew on this 2005 research for a new intervention with 68 drug users from the Lower East Side. The program both taught safe injection practices and helped users reduce weekly drug intake. And the best news? Knowledge can be contagious. Researchers noted that study participants have been spreading the word on safer drug use within their communities.     Selective Memory   What\u2019s that phone number again? Some psychologists argue that there is a finite number of items that we can hold in our minds at once, while others insist that working memory is focused on quality, not quantity.   NYU\u2019s Weiji Ma recently scored a point for the latter camp by analyzing the results of experiments in which subjects were asked to recall one of up to eight colors they\u2019d seen a few seconds ago. The quality of memories gradually diminished as subjects were asked to recall more and more colors.   Ma concluded that working memory doesn\u2019t suddenly max out: We\u2019re more likely to remember \u201ceverything a little bit\u201d than to remember some things perfectly and forget others entirely.   Now what happened to those car keys?       Covet Not   Which relative should inherit grandma\u2019s wedding silver? And when a couple splits, which spouse gets the car? Such questions can quickly lead to bickering, as there\u2019s no magic formula for divvying up prized possessions.   But with a pair of elegant algorithms , NYU politics professor Steven Brams and colleagues may have devised the next-best thing: an \u201cenvy-free\u201d guide to dividing belongings fairly in divorce and inheritance disputes.   Unlike other methods that ask the two quarreling parties to give detailed information about what they want, these algorithms are efficient and simple to use. In the first, the two players choose between items; in the second, they rank their preferences. The algorithms are \u201cenvy free\u201d because each party prefers its items to those of the other party.   Does this guarantee there will be no hurt feelings? Probably not\u2014but it beats throwing dishes.       Straight Talk   Birds fly; fish swim. People talk\u2014but with just half a brain? A new study by NYU and NYU Langone Medical Center researchers has just upended the long-standing scientific assumption that you only need one side of your brain to have a real conversation.   Using data from NYU ECoG , where neural activity is measured by placing specialized electrodes directly on the brain, the scientists proved that speech is, in fact, bilateral\u2014it involves both sides. To isolate mere speech (talking and listening) from meaningful language (constructing and understanding sentences), the researchers had study subjects repeat nonsense words like \u201ckig\u201d and \u201cpob.\u201d As they spoke, the researchers observed activity on both sides of the brain. The findings were published in Nature .   These insights could lead to more effective rehabilitation of patients with brain damage caused by strokes or epilepsy.     Scandalize. Investigate. Repeat.   Watergate. The Iran-Contra Affair. Hurricane Katrina. Does that sound like a greatest-hits of American scandals and screw-ups? It is\u2014and there are 97 more. As part of his new book Government by Investigation (Brookings Institution Press), Wagner\u2019s Paul Light has compiled a list of the federal government\u2019s 100 most significant inquiries since 1945.   What do communists in Hollywood (1947), the Kent State campus shootings (1970), and steroid abuse in baseball (2005) have in common? They all made Light\u2019s cut, along with probes into Pearl Harbor (1945), Ku Klux Klan activities (1965), the space shuttle Challenger accident (1986), and President Clinton\u2019s impeachment (1998).   Light counts 20 investigations from the 2000s alone, among them the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 2008 financial collapse, and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.   How many controversies can you name? See the full list here.       Elite Electorate   Voter turnout for U.S. presidential elections hovers around an unimpressive 60 percent. But who exactly is doing the voting? Most often, it\u2019s the rich: A study by NYU\u2019s Jonathan Nagler with American University colleague Jan Leighley found that nearly 80 percent of high-income citizens vote, compared to barely 50 percent of those considered low-income.   Studying data from every presidential election from 1972 to 2008, the researchers found that while the gap in voting between blacks and whites has largely disappeared, income inequality between voters and non-voters has remained stable. And election reforms designed to boost voter turnout have resulted in modest increases of just 2 or 3 percent.   Upending previous research, Leighley and Nagler demonstrated that voters are substantially more conservative in their economic views than are non-voters\u2014an imbalance that may well influence policy decisions to the detriment of the poor.       Sandbox Census   The stats on childhood obesity\u2014nearly a quarter of 6- to 11-year-olds don\u2019t meet U.S. guidelines for physical activity\u2014indicate that perhaps kids aren\u2019t spending enough time outdoors. That\u2019s why a team of Steinhardt researchers set out to discover who\u2019s using NYC\u2019s parks and playgrounds, and how often.   In 2010-11, the team examined 10 parks or playgrounds and counted 37,412 users, 53 percent of them children. While 60 percent of parents said these were the main places their kids played outdoors, there were significant differences among racial and socioeconomic groups: non-whites and those with household incomes of less than $20,000 were more likely to turn to playgrounds for their children\u2019s needs.   While the vast majority of parents were pleased with playground cleanliness and maintenance, some groups\u2014including Hispanics and women\u2014were more likely than others to report feeling unsafe there.       Who\u2019s Crowding the ER?   Anyone with the misfortune to wind up in an overcrowded hospital emergency room might reasonably look around and wonder, \u201cWho are all these people?\u201d   Not who you might expect, according to a new NYU Wagner study that debunked an urban legend about emergency department \u201cfrequent fliers.\u201d While it\u2019s widely assumed that addled drug addicts put the greatest burden on emergency facilities, the researchers analyzed 212,259 NYC emergency department visits and found that substance abuse and mental illness accounted for only a small share of ER traffic.   Instead, those visiting the emergency department most often were the very sick\u2014those carrying a substantial burden of disease, with chronic conditions requiring multiple hospitalizations. These repeat users were shown to have visited primary and secondary caregivers more often than the emergency department, shattering the stereotype of patients who rely on the ER for all medical needs.     Same Drug, Different Stories   Crack or powder? Not all teenage cocaine users are alike, according to a recent study by Steinhardt and NYU Langone Medical Center researchers.   Examining data from a survey of seniors at 130 high schools, the researchers found that 6.2 percent had used powder cocaine and 2.5 percent had used crack. Students who earned more than $50 per week were significantly more likely to use either form, whereas girls reported less use of powder cocaine, and students who identified as religious preferred crack.   Users of only powder cocaine\u2014not crack, as the stereotype would have it\u2014were more likely to live in urban areas.   Possession of 500 grams of powder results in a five-year prison term, while just 28 grams of crack carries the same sentence\u2014and yet the two are commonly collapsed into a common \u201ccocaine use\u201d category in research.       Precious Cargo   Here\u2019s something to think about the next time you see a minivan hurtling down the highway: the fatality rate for child passengers in U.S. car crashes is at least double that of other wealthy nations. About 2,000 die each year.   Vague and insufficient state child restraint laws could be to blame, according to a study by Steinhardt researchers.   Laws in Arizona, Michigan, and South Dakota only mentioned children under the age of four, though the American Association of Pediatrics recommends that kids keep using special seats until they\u2019re tall enough\u2014usually between the ages of 8 and 12\u2014to buckle up safely in just a seatbelt.   Other state laws didn\u2019t distinguish between rear-facing infant seats and forward-facing booster seats, and 33 states granted exceptions for commercial vehicles carrying children.   Making the laws clearer could potentially save young lives.       One Is the Loneliest Number   The middle-schooler, as anyone who has chaperoned an 8th-grade dance knows, is a highly social animal. But what you might not guess is that interacting with peers can also boost academic performance in traditionally solitary realms.   A study of middle-schoolers led by Steinhardt\u2019s Jan Plass found that playing a math video game competitively or collaboratively with another player\u2014as compared to playing alone\u2014enhanced both mastery of the subject and the student\u2019s enjoyment of the game.   \u201cWe found support for claims that well-designed games can motivate students to learn less popular subjects such as math,\u201d Plass said, \u201cand can broaden their focus beyond just collecting stars and points.\u201d   Students who played with others reported greater interest in mastering the skills the game taught, and those who played in a competitive situation performed the best of all.       Inhale. Exhale.     \u201cGot into an altercation with a guy in the kitchen....My initial response was to fight. Then I thought about the consequences.\u201d   Those are the words of a participant in a study led by the College of Nursing\u2019s Noelle Leonard, which found that mindfulness training can improve attention skills among incarcerated youth, leading to better control over emotions and actions.   Researchers followed 267 16- to 18-year-old incarcerated males for four months.   When combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy, meditation-based training helped the teens resist impulsive and risky decision-making induced by stress. The findings suggest that mindfulness could be key to reducing recidivism among young offenders.   Study participants were taught to focus on the sensation of breathing. \u201cBy repeatedly returning attention back to the breath,\u201d Leonard says, they learned to \u201cinterrupt the cycle of automatic and reactive thoughts.\u201d       Thoroughly Modern Masquarade   Kitten ears? Ghoulish makeup? Those are so last Halloween.   To get the hippest haunted look this year, you\u2019ll need some digital assistance\u2014in the form of 3D virtual masks developed by NYU-Poly instructor Mark Swarek and grad student Animesh Anad.   To wear one, you just clip a four-inch square barcode into your hair or hat, and friends who have downloaded an app can hold up their mobile devices to see your spooky skeleton skull or giant pumpkin head.   Using similar technology, 4,000 kids \u201cdressed\u201d as dinosaurs and monsters at the Brooklyn Art Fair recently ran through Prospect Park while parents watched on iPad and iPhone screens.   Swarek, a researcher at MAGNET and augmented reality pioneer, predicts that future gamers will get up from the couch and head to public parks to battle each other in virtual forts and castles.     Helping the FDNY Fight Fires? Yep, There\u2019s an App for That   What your firefighter doesn\u2019t know can hurt him\u2014and you. Today\u2019s homes, with their open-plan layouts and synthetic furnishings, are prone to blazes unlike the house fires of the past, which is why it\u2019s so important that volunteer and career squads learn the latest science on how fires spread.   Enter ALIVE, an online training tool developed by NYU-Poly researchers that\u2019s now being adopted by 50 fire departments nationwide. ALIVE\u2019s game-like modules simulate the real-time decision-making process and can be completed via computer, tablet, or smartphone\u2014allowing firefighters, many of whom work additional full-time jobs, to proceed at their own pace.   The best part? In addition to being cheaper than face-to-face instruction, the new training has also proved more effective, with ALIVE users consistently outscoring peers who have studied in the classroom.       Stop! In the Name of Reproduction   Imagine a biological stoplight that could halt birth defects in their tracks.   No such mechanism yet exists, but NYU\u2019s Andreas Hochwagen may have brought us one step closer with the discovery of an enzyme that plays \u201ctraffic cop\u201d with cell division involved in sexual reproduction.   Most cells in an organism contain two sets of chromosomes\u2014one from the mother and one from the father. But eggs and sperm have just one set, and they\u2019re produced through meiosis, the process in which maternal and paternal genes are replicated and \u201creshuffled\u201d into new combinations of DNA.   By studying meiosis in yeast, Hochwagen and a colleague found one enzyme that sends out a molecular \u201cwait\u201d signal to another that triggers DNA reshuffling. The enzyme acts as a \u201ctraffic cop\u201d by preventing the disruptions to chromosome replication that can lead to Down syndrome.       Secrets from the Antarctic Underground     On an expedition to the far reaches of Antarctica, an international group of scientists confirmed that, when it comes to climate change, we\u2019re all skating on thin ice.   Courant\u2019s David Holland was among the researchers who traveled 500 meters down into the underbelly of the Pine Island Glacier to measure the effects of the warm seawater currents melting its ice shelf from below. They found that the channel through Pine Island is melting at a rate of about six centimeters per day\u2014a startling finding given that the breakup of this ice shelf could significantly contribute to rising sea levels worldwide.   Holland\u2019s plan is to use the new measurements to improve computer models that predict changes in the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet. Understanding how glaciers melt will be key to figuring out just how watery our future will be.       (Impulse) Buyer Beware     Ever popped into the grocery store for a gallon of milk and walked out with a whole cartful of treats? Impulse buying: It happens to the best of us. But why? The Stern School\u2019s Sam Hui and colleagues recently zeroed in on the causes of this budget-busting behavior\u2014by videotaping grocery stores from the shopper\u2019s point-of-view.   They found that items that are on promotion, need to be refrigerated, or are high in \u201chedonicity\u201d (like chocolate) are prime candidates for unplanned purchases, and that shoppers who stand close to shelves or browse store circulars are more likely to stray from their shopping lists.   \u201cRetailers can employ several strategies to convert shoppers from passive browsers to buyers,\u201d says Hui. But it takes two to tango: The researchers also found that customers often leave room for unplanned purchases in their mental budgets.       How Obesity Leads to Cancer   Here\u2019s yet another reason to renew that gym membership: A third of the nation\u2019s new cancer cases this year will be related to obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet\u2014and Steinhardt nutritional epidemiologist Niyati Parekh may have the key to why that is.   In a recent study, Parekh explored the link between body fatness and cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, colorectum, and breast. Her theory? Obesity causes higher concentrations of both insulin and glucose, which can encourage cancer cells to grow and multiply faster than they would in a slimmer person. Going forward, she says, scientists could use these findings to develop lifestyle guidelines to simultaneously control cancer and address America\u2019s weight problem.   Meantime, just keep moving: Sedentary living, Parekh says, is a chief culprit in creating the excess body fat that can disrupt insulin regulation.       Can We Reduce Our Dietary Footprint?     When it comes to what we eat, the world\u2019s people can be divided into two groups: \u201cstuffed\u201d and \u201cstarved.\u201d   As Steinhardt\u2019s Amy Bentley puts it, \u201cWesterners are eating enormous quantities of sugar, beef, chicken, wheat, and dairy products\u201d\u2014and in addition to being bad for our health, that diet has bred overconsumption, leading to severe food shortages in parts of the world. Meat is so central to the Western diet that our \u201cecological footprint\u201d exceeds the biocapacity of the entire planet.   Reversing the trend will be difficult, according to Bentley and her colleagues , who\u2019ve written \u201cSustainable Consumption: Reworking the Western Diet,\u201d a TED Studies analysis that describes the genesis of the modern food system and offers alternative approaches for a sustainable future.   Their first steps for change? Interest in food origins and technologies that track food from \u201cfarm to table.\u201d       Stressing Over Stress     It sounds like the predicament of a Woody Allen character\u2014you seek therapy for anxiety, but you\u2019re too stressed to practice the calming techniques your therapist recommends. A team of NYU neurologists led by Elizabeth Phelps observed this phenomenon in a two-day experiment showing that even mild amounts of stress can thwart cognitive-behavioral therapies commonly prescribed to control emotions.     The researchers first conditioned participants to fear images of snakes or spiders by pairing the pictures with mild electric shocks, and then taught them strategies for combating that fear. The next day half the group had their hands plunged into icy water to induce stress. When exposed to the spooky images again, those with icy hands were unable to calm themselves using the strategies they\u2019d learned, whereas a control group made effective use of the previous day\u2019s training to reduce fear.       Thanks for the Memories?   It\u2019s the bread and butter of every police procedural from Dragnet to Law &amp; Order: Two witnesses give differing accounts of the same crime. Duplicitous accomplices aside, psychologists have long understood memory recall to be complex and sometimes unreliable. Luckily, rats seem to have the same problem\u2014which allows researchers like NYU\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Fenton to peer into their minds and better understand what goes on in ours.   By monitoring the electrical activity in rats\u2019 brains, Fenton and SUNY Downstate\u2019s Eduard Kelemen observed that when the animals explore a new environment, their brain activity sometimes matches that of a previous one. The findings suggest neurons carry stored memories, environmental circumstances, and current state of mind \u2014a mixture that might cause one to pick the wrong guy in a lineup but that can also, Fenton says, \u201camount to valuable insight and knowledge.\u201d                                                                                                                                                                      NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

The study, which appears in the Journal of Neuroscience , provides fresh evidence on the brain\u2019s role in communication.     \u201cOur findings show that the brains of both speakers and listeners take language predictability into account, resulting in more similar brain activity patterns between the two,\u201d says Suzanne Dikker, the study\u2019s lead author and a post-doctoral researcher in New York University\u2019s Department of Psychology and Utrecht University. \u201cCrucially, this happens even before a sentence is spoken and heard.\u201d   \u201cA lot of what we've learned about language and the brain has been from controlled laboratory tests that tend to look at language in the abstract\u2014you get a string of words or you hear one word at a time,\u201d adds Jason Zevin, an associate professor of psychology and linguistics at the University of Southern California and one of the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cThey\u2019re not so much about communication, but about the structure of language. The current experiment is really about how we use language to express common ground or share our understanding of an event with someone else.\u201d    The study\u2019s other authors were Lauren Silbert, a recent PhD graduate from Princeton University, and Uri Hasson, an assistant professor in Princeton\u2019s Department of Psychology.   Traditionally, it was thought that our brains always process the world around us from the \u201cbottom up\u201d\u2014when we hear someone speak, our auditory cortex first processes the sounds, and then other areas in the brain put those sounds together into words and then sentences and larger discourse units. From here, we derive meaning and an understanding of the content of what is said to us.   However, in recent years, many neuroscientists have shifted to a \u201ctop-down\u201d view of the brain, which they now see as a \u201cprediction machine\u201d: We are constantly anticipating events in the world around us so that we can respond to them quickly and accurately. For example, we can predict words and sounds based on context\u2014and our brain takes advantage of this. For instance, when we hear \u201cGrass is\u2026\u201d we can easily predict \u201cgreen.\u201d   What\u2019s less understood is how this predictability might affect the speaker\u2019s brain, or even the interaction between speakers and listeners.   In the Journal of Neuroscience study, the researchers collected brain responses from a speaker while she described images that she had viewed. These images varied in terms of likely predictability for a specific description. For instance, one image showed a penguin hugging a star (a relatively easy image in which to predict a speaker\u2019s description). However, another image depicted a guitar stirring a bicycle tire submerged in a boiling pot of water\u2014a picture that is much less likely to yield a predictable description: Is it \u201ca guitar cooking a tire,\u201d \u201ca guitar boiling a wheel,\u201d or \u201ca guitar stirring a bike\u201d?   Then, another group of subjects listened to those descriptions while viewing the same images. During this period, the researchers monitored the subjects\u2019 brain activity.   When comparing the speaker\u2019s brain responses directly to the listeners\u2019 brain responses, they found that activity patterns in brain areas where spoken words are processed were more similar between the listeners and the speaker when the listeners could predict what the speaker was going to say.   When listeners can predict what a speaker is going to say, the authors suggest, their brains take advantage of this by sending a signal to their auditory cortex that it can expect sound patterns corresponding to predicted words (e.g., \u201cgreen\u201d while hearing \u201cgrass is...\u201d). Interestingly, they add, the speaker's brain is showing a similar effect as she is planning what she will say: brain activity in her auditory language areas is affected by how predictable her utterance will be for her listeners.     \u201cIn addition to facilitating rapid and accurate processing of the world around us, the predictive power of our brains might play an important role in human communication,\u201d notes Dikker, who conducted some of the research as a post-doctoral fellow at Weill Cornell Medical College\u2019s Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology. \u201cDuring conversation, we adapt our speech rate and word choices to each other\u2014for example, when explaining science to a child as opposed to a fellow scientist\u2014and these processes are governed by our brains, which correspondingly align to each other.\u201d   This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (P01-HD001994, R01-MH094480), Chinese Academy of Sciences Fellowships for Young International Scientists (2012Y1SA0004), and a Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research Innovation Scheme Veni Grant (275-89-018).

Hear names like Scooby Doo, Spice, and K2 in a high school and you can be pretty sure students aren\u2019t talking about their favorite entertainers.   Synthetic cannabinoids, designed to have similar effects to those of cannabis and marketed under such names, are often sold as a legal alternative to marijuana, though they are more harmful. Synthetics have been linked to 11,561 U.S. reports of poisonings between January and 2009 and April 2011, and 11.4% of high school seniors reported using them in 2011. Which teenagers are most likely to try them? NYU\u2019s Center for Drug Use and HIV Research found that those most at risk are male, white, go out 3 to 4 times a week, use other substances, are regular smokers, use natural marijuana regularly, or have been lifetime users of a different illicit drug.    The draw? Avoiding arrest.     Location Location Location   Would you buy an iPhone from the wrong side of the tracks?   Residents of lower-income areas are often the most hard-pressed for extra cash\u2014and yet when it comes selling goods online, their very neighborhoods can work to stigmatize them as untrustworthy, researchers in NYU\u2019s department of sociology found .   In their experiment, they evaluated responses to online classified ads for iPhone 5\u2019s in 12 cities\u2014placed in various neighborhoods determined to be advantaged or disadvantaged based on census data. All other factors being equal, the ads originating from the disadvantaged neighborhoods received 16 percent fewer responses than did those from tonier ones. And the disparity was even greater\u2014about 21 percent fewer responses\u2014for poor neighborhoods that were predominantly black.   It\u2019s yet another example of how perceptions\u2014even false ones\u2014can reinforce disparities in economic opportunity. The rich get richer...     Stop the Presses!   Velcro. Penicillin. The microwave oven.   To that list of famous accidental discoveries we can now add an answer to one of life\u2019s most vexing questions: How many licks does it take to reach the center of a lollipop?   A group of Courant and Florida State University researchers recently came up with an estimate\u2014in the midst of a larger study of how materials change shape and dissolve in water. In the experiment, they immersed hard candies in a current, and found that the \u201csculpture\u201d that emerged as the candy dissolved took on the same shape every time, regardless of the speed of the water flow or the initial shape of the candy.   Their theory about how things shrink and dissolve has applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and for geologists studying erosion.   Oh\u2014and it takes about 1,000 licks.     It Really Is the Thought That Counts   That pricey designer clutch you just picked out for your sister-in-law? Don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not a big hit on Christmas morning, one NYU psychologist warns. She might have preferred a simple, functional tote.   It\u2019s no secret that the holiday season can trigger major stress over finding the perfect gift for loved ones. But Yaacov Trope\u2019s research suggests it\u2019s overthinking that really gets us into trouble: Gift givers tend to obsess over finding fancy presents, when it turns out that most people would rather receive something practical.   That means, for example, that an Italian food lover would choose a gift certificate to a medium-rated Italian restaurant five minutes from her home over one to a top-rated place an hour away\u2014something to keep in mind when tackling your shopping list this year.

You drink from it, look through it, and sometimes even cut your foot on it\u2014but what do you really know about glass?   For years the material\u2014and how it transforms from solid to liquid\u2014has puzzled scientists, because its particles are disorganized compared to those in metals.   Glass is a colloid, which means it\u2019s made up of tiny particles that wiggle a little in place. But with all that wiggling, how does it remain solid?   NYU researchers have crafted a theory \u2014based on observations dating back to James C. Maxwell in the 19th century\u2014that the particles move in a coordinated way, engaging in a kind of microscopic dance party within a structure just strong enough to contain the frenzy.   Such research could have far-reaching implications, as colloids are also found in milk, paint, and gelatin\u2014and our blood.     Strength in Numbers   In 2011, the U.S. government discontinued its color-coded system alerting Americans to the terrorist threat level facing the country. Since its implementation in 2002, the warning scale had never dropped below \u201cyellow\u201d\u2014a 3 out of 5 in terms of danger.   But many of us still worry about terrorism\u2014and our perceptions of risk can vary depending on how close we feel to our fellow Americans, Steinhardt\u2019s Rezarta Bilali found .   She surveyed 147 university students on whether they perceived Americans to be similar to each other or different, and then showed them a (fake) newspaper article about a national security risk. Those who believed Americans are unlike each other were more likely to perceive a heightened threat when they read the article\u2014and more likely to support the U.S.\u2019s involvement in the war in Iraq.

Beyond that first awkward \u201cbirds-and-bees\u201d lecture, many families aren\u2019t eager to talk about sex\u2014at least not in detail, a survey of parents and children (aged 9-21) by Planned Parenthood and NYU\u2019s Silver School found.   Of those polled, one in five parents had never talked specifically about birth control methods or strategies for saying no to sex, and 30% had offered no guidance on where to go for reproductive health care. For parents of 15- to 21-year-olds, 91% knew that their kids were having sexual intercourse, but just 40% were informed that their children were engaging in oral sex.    And though 61% of parents said people should hold off on sex until they\u2019re in a serious relationship, only 52% had actually told their kids that.   Time for The Talk, Part II?     See No Evil, Hear No Evil     For a child, is there anything worse than watching Mom and Dad fight?   Here\u2019s yet another reason frazzled parents should seek help in dealing with relationship anger and stress:   A study tracking 1,025 children found that adversity at home had varying effects on their ability to recognize and control feelings such as fear and sadness. In an emotions labeling task administered to the children just before their fifth birthday, Steinhardt\u2019s C. Cybele Raver and colleagues found that those who\u2019d been exposed to physical aggression between parents performed poorly, whereas\u2014surprisingly\u2014children who\u2019d witnessed only verbal aggression displayed a greater understanding of different emotions.   But knowledge isn\u2019t always power. Both types of clashes between parents were linked to kids\u2019 difficulty in regulating their own negative feelings\u2014which could put them at risk for anxiety and depression later on.     Tweeting Across the Aisle     Another election cycle, another chance for pundits to herald the increased polarization of politics in our brave new (digital) world: With the internet, the argument goes, we\u2019ve built ourselves echo chambers\u2014online communities where we engage with like-minded peers in discussions that only reinforce what we already believe.   Old news, right?   Not so fast, cautions NYU\u2019s Pablo Barber\u00e1. In a study of millions of social media users in Germany, Spain, and the U.S., he found that platforms like Twitter actually reduce polarization by exposing people to political messages they wouldn\u2019t otherwise encounter. That\u2019s because our social networks include not just BFFs, but also people with whom we have only \u201cweak ties\u201d\u2014and wouldn\u2019t choose to chat politics with offline.   Something to consider before \u201cunfriending\u201d a zealous acquaintance for one too many rants in your Facebook newsfeed.     Shy Is Not Stupid     True, but unfair: Teachers often neglect the quiet kid in the corner in favor of the motormouth in the front row. Because of this, shy children are at risk for poor academic achievement. But a new Steinhardt study found a way to help these overlooked pupils reach their full potential\u2014without pressuring them to \u201ccome out of their shell.\u201d   Enter the INSIGHTS into Children\u2019s Temperament intervention, which focuses on supporting personality differences instead of trying to change them. In a study of nearly 350 children transitioning from kindergarten to first grade, half the students participated in INSIGHT, and half attended a traditional after-school reading program.    While math and critical thinking skills of shy children of the second group declined, these skills improved in shy children of the first group\u2014 proving that being shy does not have to be a disadvantage.     Video Killed Objectivity     You\u2019d think that video evidence used in court would help everybody to see the objective truth, right? Not so fast. It turns out that everyday prejudices aren\u2019t so easily shed: A series of experiments by NYU psychologists and colleagues from the Yale School of Law showed that instead of challenging our biases, video evidence might in fact enhance them.    In one, 152 participants watched videos of ambiguous altercations between a police officer and a civilian, while researchers tracked their eye movements. A survey determined how connected participants felt to the social group of each officer.   Those who did not identify with the police officer suggested harsher punishments for his behavior. The discrepancy was also linked to how much participants fixed their gaze on each officer: The more they looked, the more their established beliefs about police misconduct were confirmed.     Risky Business     Play it safe, or go all in? Your gambling style might be determined by your brain structure, a study by NYU\u2019s Paul Glimcher and colleagues found. Specifically, it\u2019s a part of the parietal cortex that matters: Those with a larger volume in this part of the brain proved more willing to take more risks than those with a smaller volume there.   In the study, a few dozen young adults chose between monetary lotteries that varied in their level of risk while researchers conducted MRI scans on their brains. This is the first time brain structure has been used to explain financial decisions.   The same research team has also shown that as the parietal cortex thins with age, people become more likely to avoid risks\u2014something to keep in mind next time you sit down to a poker game with Grandma.     Nurses in Flight   As anyone who\u2019s ever suffered first-day-of-school or work jitters knows, starting a new gig can be stressful. That\u2019s especially true in demanding medical fields, survey data from The RN Work Project, a 10-year longitudinal study of nurses, suggests. Researchers recently discovered that around 17.5 percent of newly licensed RNs leave their first job within a year, and a whopping 33.5 percent leave within two years.   All the shuffling can cost a large hospital as much as $6.4 million, and can even impact patient care, studies indicate, leading to increases in bedsores and falls.   Still, not all such turnover is bad: There\u2019s a big difference between an ineffective nurse washing out and a highly competent one quitting, of course. And a nurse who leaves one post may do so to take up a similar one\u2014sometimes within the same hospital.     What Lies Beneath   Nearly half a mile below the Antarctic ice sheet, there\u2019s a hidden lake. And in that lake, there\u2019s life\u2014whole ecosystems, in fact, a team of researchers (including Courant\u2019s Knut Christianson) recently revealed in a paper for the journal Nature.   Don\u2019t picture ducklings and swans, though: The diverse community of critters the scientists found consists of microbes that can mine rocks for energy and use CO 2 as their source of carbon.   With funding from the National Science Foundation, a team of explorers used a hot-water drill to reach 2,600 feet down and retrieve water samples from Antarctica\u2019s Lake Whillans last year. The subsequent discovery of organisms in those samples raises questions about what might be lurking in the other 400 lakes and numerous rivers under Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet\u2014and on other frozen planets in our solar system and beyond.     Patience is a Virtue\u2014and Prevents Scarring!   Salicylic acid. Benzoyl peroxide. Toothpaste. Egg whites. Whatever you smeared on your face in an effort to banish pimples during your teen years, you probably forgot one essential ingredient: time.   Take it from Seth J. Orlow, an NYU dermatologist who\u2019s been treating adolescent acne for more than 25 years: There\u2019s still no overnight miracle cure\u2014though medications do work, provided you have patience. (That means not giving up when you don\u2019t see improvement immediately\u2014a concept his hormone-addled patients tend to have trouble with.)   Orlow is also in the business of mythbusting: No, you can\u2019t scrub acne away, he says. And stop blaming your diet.   Another piece of advice? Leave those zits alone! \u201cI fervently encourage all of my acne patients not to pick at their lesions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to avoid scarring, not foster it.\u201d     Hackers, Do Your Worst     That clever password you just devised for online banking? It won\u2019t protect you if your financial institution\u2019s database is hacked\u2014a fate that befalls dozens of high profile companies each year. Criminals outmaneuver encryption schemes by intercepting database keys or administrator passwords\u2014and after that it\u2019s just a matter of cracking into individual accounts. With computers that can check a billion six-character combinations per second, thieves can potentially decode about three passwords per hour.   That\u2019s why NYU School of Engineering\u2019s Justin Cappos and colleagues have devised PolyPasswordHasher\u2014a storage method that divides secret information into shares, meaning that to verify any single password, an attacker would have to correctly guess at least three of them simultaneously. In practice, this would take all 900 million computers on Earth working nonstop for longer than 13 billion years. So, you know\u2014don\u2019t panic.      Give a Hug, Help a Brain     Reason no. 20,746 to thank mom for raising you: Her touch isn\u2019t just soothing\u2014it directly shapes a baby\u2019s brain. Scientists have long known that parental bonding plays an important role in neural development, but a group of NYU Langone researchers have become the first to study that process in real time. They watched 100 hours of video of mama rats tending to their young, and compared the footage to brain scans from rat babies, or \u201cpups,\u201d outfitted with miniature wireless transmitters.   The takeaway? Brain wave patterns changed depending on whether the pups were nursing or left alone\u2014and researchers believe such variations caused by nurturing interactions with mom help hard-wire a healthy brain for life. In fact, when mother rats groomed their pups, brain activity spiked by more than 100 percent. (Awww.)     Gateway to Ecstasy   MDMA\u2026E\u2026X\u2014whatever you call it, ecstasy remains popular among adolescents and young adults despite an overall decline in its use since the peak period of the late 1990s and early 2000s. A recent study by NYU researchers found that 4.4% of high school seniors reported using ecstasy within the last year, with boys at particularly high risk for use.   Analyzing data from a survey administered nationwide in 130 schools, they concluded that previous use of other drugs was the biggest predictor of ecstasy use, drowning out other socioeconomic factors. In addition, girls and religious students were at lower odds for use, as were black and Hispanic students and those residing with two parents\u2014unless they were already using other substances.   Money matters, too: Odds of using ecstasy increased for students with a job paying more than $50 per week.       Monkey Match   Gazing into the eyes of a potential mate is a time-honored pastime of lovers everywhere. But what if that ritual also involved checking your partner\u2019s face for differently colored eyebrow patches, ear tufts, and nose spots?   Some types of Old World monkeys use those visual markers, which have evolved over time, to avoid interbreeding with similar species, NYU researchers have found . The anthropologists used facial recognition algorithms to compare 1,400 photographs of guenons\u2014a group of more than two dozen species of monkeys who live side-by-side in the forests of Central and West Africa\u2014to explore differences in their facial features.   The results showed that the face patterns of various guenon species sharing the same territory have evolved to appear distinct from one another, cutting down on the risk of hybridization and infertile offspring.     When Money Isn\u2019t Just Green   No one likes the feeling that there\u2019s not enough money to go around. But a new study by NYU psychologists found that a sense of scarcity can lead to more than penny pinching: In lean economic times, African Americans tend to appear \u201cblacker\u201d to whites.   In one experiment, non-black study participants were asked to view 110 computer-generated images of faces ranging from light- to dark-skinned. Those who\u2019d indicated through survey questions that they believed that \u201cwhen blacks make economic gains, whites lose out economically\u201d had a lower threshold for identifying mixed-race faces as black.   In another, adults randomly selected from a city park were asked to divide up $15 between imaginary people (represented by composite faces) gave significantly less money to the face that looked blacker.   Watch Stephen Colbert\u2019s take on the study and and read more in Time and The Star-Ledger .        Eyes as a Window to...the Brain?   Here\u2019s something you didn\u2019t see coming as a kid who dreamt of flying to the moon: Space travel could give you poor eyesight.   The nerves that move the eyes are very sensitive to changes in pressure in the brain, which could explain why astronauts exposed to elevated pressure in space suffer from visual impairment. Back here on Earth, weaknesses in those nerves can be a symptom of concussion or other traumatic brain injury.   That\u2019s why biotech whizzes at Oculogica, co-founded by Stern grad Robert Ritlop (MBA\u201914) and the School of Medicine\u2019s Uzma Samadani, are developing EyeBox, a diagnostic tool that uses eye tracking to detect problems in the brain.   The National Space Biomedical Research Institute recently funded further development of EyeBox through a $250,000 SMARTCAP grant\u2014used to encourage the development of products to meet a need in space and on Earth.       DNA Origami   Forget paper cranes.   Chemistry professor Nadrian Seeman and colleagues at NYU and the University of Melbourne are practicing the delicate art of manipulating shapes at a much, much smaller scale.   Using DNA origami, which employs two hundred short DNA strands to direct longer strands into forming specific shapes, the researchers created amyloid fibrils\u2014aggregated proteins as strong as spider\u2019s silk\u2014and a tiny nanotube (just one billionth of a meter in diameter) to house them. Their results are published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .   Creating two-dimensional shapes like these on the nanoscale could enhance fiber optics and electronic devices by reducing their size and increasing their speed.   \u201cSmall is so exciting\u2014you can make better structures on the tiniest chemical scales,\u201d Seeman says.     Move Over, Silicon   BREAKING\u2014 The Graduate was indeed ahead of its time, because the future can still be summed up in one word: plastics. The flexible, inexpensive material could one day replace the silicon used in computer and phone processors\u2014and thanks to new research by NYU physicists, that day is closer than ever.   Researchers focused on overcoming one big obstacle to making these plastic devices cheaply: the large amount of energy required to read information stored on them. (The trick is in converting data stored magnetically to light for fiber optic transmission.) In a recent experiment, they managed to transfer information between a magnet and an organic light-emitting diode, without electrical current flowing between the two.   The catch? Their device wasn\u2019t petite\u2014so the technology will have to be miniaturized before it can make its way into our favorite mobile gadgets.     Going With the Flow?   Leonardo da Vinci was onto something when he noticed that water falling into a pond created eddies of motion. The phenomenon he observed in the swirling currents is what scientists call turbulence\u2014and it remains mysterious to physicists and mathematicians even today.   Turbulence is all around us: the efficiency of a jet engine, for example, depends on it. But other forms of this kind of fluid motion are much less familiar. NYU\u2019s Katepalli Sreenivasan is part of a team of researchers studying quantum turbulence\u2014the very chaotic motion of fluids at temperatures close to zero. These fluids are unlike ordinary air or water in that there\u2019s no resistance to hinder their flow.   By studying these differences\u2014between quantum and classical turbulence\u2014Sreenivasan and colleagues could uncover phenomena not yet known to physics. Talk about making waves!     When Stars Die   They do not go gentle into that good night! Picture stripped-envelope supernovae as brilliant as a billion suns and gamma-ray bursts that launch particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Both are symptoms of stellar collapse, but astronomers so far have been unable to figure out which stars produce these types of explosions on their way out.   That\u2019s where NYU physicist Maryam Modjaz comes in. She\u2019s won a 5-year, $500,000 NSF CAREER Award for a scientific investigative method she calls \u201cstellar forensics.\u201d By studying the mass and metallicity (the proportion of matter made of elements other than hydrogen and helium) of the celestial habitats of the explosions, her research team will be able to deduce the makeup of the stars producing the big outbursts. And that , in turn, could help trace the chemical history of the universe.     Snapshots from the Mind\u2019s Eye     Who needs a police-department sketch artist when scientists can pluck a suspect\u2019s face directly from the mind of an eyewitness (no psychic required!)?   Thanks to advances in fMRI technology, a trio of researchers including NYU\u2019s Brice Kuhl are honing the art of mindreading. In a recent study , the scientists scanned the brains of six volunteers as they viewed images of 300 different \u201ctraining\u201d faces, and then repeated the process with 30 new faces. By comparing these new scans to the previous 300, the researchers were able to produce recognizable images of the faces as they appeared in volunteers\u2019 minds.   The pictures aren\u2019t perfect yet, but a more advanced version of this method could one day be used to help understand how autistic children respond to faces, to assess racial prejudice, or even to recreate faces from dreams.   Read more in the Wall Street Journal .       We Still Love You, BU   Alarming, though not especially surprising: People tend to dehumanize members of groups they don\u2019t belong to. NYU and Harvard researchers recently showed undergrads pictures of human faces that had been morphed together with inanimate objects (like dolls or statues). The students were more likely to deem a hybrid image as \u201chaving a mind\u201d if it was labeled as belonging to their \u201cin-group.\u201d   So a Democrat might imagine a Republican to be mindless, unless\u2014and here\u2019s the new wrinkle\u2014the Democrat views the Republican as threatening, the researchers found. NYU students who identified strongly with their school were more likely to perceive faces labeled as Boston University students as rivals, and were therefore more likely than other NYU students to report that the BU students had minds. The same held for ardent political party supporters who viewed their adversaries as threatening.     Waiting for the Phone to Ring   Even women seeking to date men who\u2019ll treat them as equals can be shy to ask those guys out, a new study by NYU sociologist Ellen Lamont found. She interviewed 38 female college graduates\u2014average age 31\u2014who described their ideal relationship as one in which partners equally shared economic, housework, and childcare responsibilities. Three quarters of those who had or wanted children said they had not interrupted or would not interrupt their careers to become stay-at-home moms.   But despite their egalitarian ideals, the women clung to traditional gender roles in the realm of dating: They said that men are responsible for asking women out, paying for dates, and proposing marriage. Many feared rejection when pursuing relationships, and expressed a preference for being pursued and desired. Take notice, rom-com screenwriters!       Tomes for Tots?   Sure, your baby could be the next great Tolstoy scholar\u2014but don\u2019t count on him to crack open War and Peace just yet. A Steinhardt study has busted the myth that, with a little help from educational DVDs and flashcards, infants can learn to read.   The researchers studied 117 infants aged nine to 18 months, some of whom received a baby media product\u2014DVDs, flashcards, or flipbooks\u2014to be used daily for seven months.   When the babies who\u2019d been given the educational materials were tested on their capacity to recognize letter names, letter sounds, and words by sight, they scored just as poorly as those in the control group, who hadn\u2019t been \u201cstudying.\u201d   The products did have one profound effect\u2014on parents, who in exit interviews expressed the belief that their precocious progeny were well on their way to literacy.     A Safer Fix   Nine percent of new HIV infections originate from drug use, and 70 to 77 percent of people who inject drugs have hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That\u2019s why researchers at NYU\u2019s Center for Drug Use and HIV Research have studied the behaviors of people who\u2019ve injected drugs for 8 to 15 years and not contracted these diseases.   Aiming to reduce disease transmission among all addicts, colleagues from the National Development Research Institutes drew on this 2005 research for a new intervention with 68 drug users from the Lower East Side. The program both taught safe injection practices and helped users reduce weekly drug intake. And the best news? Knowledge can be contagious. Researchers noted that study participants have been spreading the word on safer drug use within their communities.     Selective Memory   What\u2019s that phone number again? Some psychologists argue that there is a finite number of items that we can hold in our minds at once, while others insist that working memory is focused on quality, not quantity.   NYU\u2019s Weiji Ma recently scored a point for the latter camp by analyzing the results of experiments in which subjects were asked to recall one of up to eight colors they\u2019d seen a few seconds ago. The quality of memories gradually diminished as subjects were asked to recall more and more colors.   Ma concluded that working memory doesn\u2019t suddenly max out: We\u2019re more likely to remember \u201ceverything a little bit\u201d than to remember some things perfectly and forget others entirely.   Now what happened to those car keys?       Covet Not   Which relative should inherit grandma\u2019s wedding silver? And when a couple splits, which spouse gets the car? Such questions can quickly lead to bickering, as there\u2019s no magic formula for divvying up prized possessions.   But with a pair of elegant algorithms , NYU politics professor Steven Brams and colleagues may have devised the next-best thing: an \u201cenvy-free\u201d guide to dividing belongings fairly in divorce and inheritance disputes.   Unlike other methods that ask the two quarreling parties to give detailed information about what they want, these algorithms are efficient and simple to use. In the first, the two players choose between items; in the second, they rank their preferences. The algorithms are \u201cenvy free\u201d because each party prefers its items to those of the other party.   Does this guarantee there will be no hurt feelings? Probably not\u2014but it beats throwing dishes.       Straight Talk   Birds fly; fish swim. People talk\u2014but with just half a brain? A new study by NYU and NYU Langone Medical Center researchers has just upended the long-standing scientific assumption that you only need one side of your brain to have a real conversation.   Using data from NYU ECoG , where neural activity is measured by placing specialized electrodes directly on the brain, the scientists proved that speech is, in fact, bilateral\u2014it involves both sides. To isolate mere speech (talking and listening) from meaningful language (constructing and understanding sentences), the researchers had study subjects repeat nonsense words like \u201ckig\u201d and \u201cpob.\u201d As they spoke, the researchers observed activity on both sides of the brain. The findings were published in Nature .   These insights could lead to more effective rehabilitation of patients with brain damage caused by strokes or epilepsy.     Scandalize. Investigate. Repeat.   Watergate. The Iran-Contra Affair. Hurricane Katrina. Does that sound like a greatest-hits of American scandals and screw-ups? It is\u2014and there are 97 more. As part of his new book Government by Investigation (Brookings Institution Press), Wagner\u2019s Paul Light has compiled a list of the federal government\u2019s 100 most significant inquiries since 1945.   What do communists in Hollywood (1947), the Kent State campus shootings (1970), and steroid abuse in baseball (2005) have in common? They all made Light\u2019s cut, along with probes into Pearl Harbor (1945), Ku Klux Klan activities (1965), the space shuttle Challenger accident (1986), and President Clinton\u2019s impeachment (1998).   Light counts 20 investigations from the 2000s alone, among them the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 2008 financial collapse, and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.   How many controversies can you name? See the full list here.       Elite Electorate   Voter turnout for U.S. presidential elections hovers around an unimpressive 60 percent. But who exactly is doing the voting? Most often, it\u2019s the rich: A study by NYU\u2019s Jonathan Nagler with American University colleague Jan Leighley found that nearly 80 percent of high-income citizens vote, compared to barely 50 percent of those considered low-income.   Studying data from every presidential election from 1972 to 2008, the researchers found that while the gap in voting between blacks and whites has largely disappeared, income inequality between voters and non-voters has remained stable. And election reforms designed to boost voter turnout have resulted in modest increases of just 2 or 3 percent.   Upending previous research, Leighley and Nagler demonstrated that voters are substantially more conservative in their economic views than are non-voters\u2014an imbalance that may well influence policy decisions to the detriment of the poor.       Sandbox Census   The stats on childhood obesity\u2014nearly a quarter of 6- to 11-year-olds don\u2019t meet U.S. guidelines for physical activity\u2014indicate that perhaps kids aren\u2019t spending enough time outdoors. That\u2019s why a team of Steinhardt researchers set out to discover who\u2019s using NYC\u2019s parks and playgrounds, and how often.   In 2010-11, the team examined 10 parks or playgrounds and counted 37,412 users, 53 percent of them children. While 60 percent of parents said these were the main places their kids played outdoors, there were significant differences among racial and socioeconomic groups: non-whites and those with household incomes of less than $20,000 were more likely to turn to playgrounds for their children\u2019s needs.   While the vast majority of parents were pleased with playground cleanliness and maintenance, some groups\u2014including Hispanics and women\u2014were more likely than others to report feeling unsafe there.       Who\u2019s Crowding the ER?   Anyone with the misfortune to wind up in an overcrowded hospital emergency room might reasonably look around and wonder, \u201cWho are all these people?\u201d   Not who you might expect, according to a new NYU Wagner study that debunked an urban legend about emergency department \u201cfrequent fliers.\u201d While it\u2019s widely assumed that addled drug addicts put the greatest burden on emergency facilities, the researchers analyzed 212,259 NYC emergency department visits and found that substance abuse and mental illness accounted for only a small share of ER traffic.   Instead, those visiting the emergency department most often were the very sick\u2014those carrying a substantial burden of disease, with chronic conditions requiring multiple hospitalizations. These repeat users were shown to have visited primary and secondary caregivers more often than the emergency department, shattering the stereotype of patients who rely on the ER for all medical needs.     Same Drug, Different Stories   Crack or powder? Not all teenage cocaine users are alike, according to a recent study by Steinhardt and NYU Langone Medical Center researchers.   Examining data from a survey of seniors at 130 high schools, the researchers found that 6.2 percent had used powder cocaine and 2.5 percent had used crack. Students who earned more than $50 per week were significantly more likely to use either form, whereas girls reported less use of powder cocaine, and students who identified as religious preferred crack.   Users of only powder cocaine\u2014not crack, as the stereotype would have it\u2014were more likely to live in urban areas.   Possession of 500 grams of powder results in a five-year prison term, while just 28 grams of crack carries the same sentence\u2014and yet the two are commonly collapsed into a common \u201ccocaine use\u201d category in research.       Precious Cargo   Here\u2019s something to think about the next time you see a minivan hurtling down the highway: the fatality rate for child passengers in U.S. car crashes is at least double that of other wealthy nations. About 2,000 die each year.   Vague and insufficient state child restraint laws could be to blame, according to a study by Steinhardt researchers.   Laws in Arizona, Michigan, and South Dakota only mentioned children under the age of four, though the American Association of Pediatrics recommends that kids keep using special seats until they\u2019re tall enough\u2014usually between the ages of 8 and 12\u2014to buckle up safely in just a seatbelt.   Other state laws didn\u2019t distinguish between rear-facing infant seats and forward-facing booster seats, and 33 states granted exceptions for commercial vehicles carrying children.   Making the laws clearer could potentially save young lives.       One Is the Loneliest Number   The middle-schooler, as anyone who has chaperoned an 8th-grade dance knows, is a highly social animal. But what you might not guess is that interacting with peers can also boost academic performance in traditionally solitary realms.   A study of middle-schoolers led by Steinhardt\u2019s Jan Plass found that playing a math video game competitively or collaboratively with another player\u2014as compared to playing alone\u2014enhanced both mastery of the subject and the student\u2019s enjoyment of the game.   \u201cWe found support for claims that well-designed games can motivate students to learn less popular subjects such as math,\u201d Plass said, \u201cand can broaden their focus beyond just collecting stars and points.\u201d   Students who played with others reported greater interest in mastering the skills the game taught, and those who played in a competitive situation performed the best of all.       Inhale. Exhale.     \u201cGot into an altercation with a guy in the kitchen....My initial response was to fight. Then I thought about the consequences.\u201d   Those are the words of a participant in a study led by the College of Nursing\u2019s Noelle Leonard, which found that mindfulness training can improve attention skills among incarcerated youth, leading to better control over emotions and actions.   Researchers followed 267 16- to 18-year-old incarcerated males for four months.   When combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy, meditation-based training helped the teens resist impulsive and risky decision-making induced by stress. The findings suggest that mindfulness could be key to reducing recidivism among young offenders.   Study participants were taught to focus on the sensation of breathing. \u201cBy repeatedly returning attention back to the breath,\u201d Leonard says, they learned to \u201cinterrupt the cycle of automatic and reactive thoughts.\u201d       Thoroughly Modern Masquarade   Kitten ears? Ghoulish makeup? Those are so last Halloween.   To get the hippest haunted look this year, you\u2019ll need some digital assistance\u2014in the form of 3D virtual masks developed by NYU-Poly instructor Mark Swarek and grad student Animesh Anad.   To wear one, you just clip a four-inch square barcode into your hair or hat, and friends who have downloaded an app can hold up their mobile devices to see your spooky skeleton skull or giant pumpkin head.   Using similar technology, 4,000 kids \u201cdressed\u201d as dinosaurs and monsters at the Brooklyn Art Fair recently ran through Prospect Park while parents watched on iPad and iPhone screens.   Swarek, a researcher at MAGNET and augmented reality pioneer, predicts that future gamers will get up from the couch and head to public parks to battle each other in virtual forts and castles.     Helping the FDNY Fight Fires? Yep, There\u2019s an App for That   What your firefighter doesn\u2019t know can hurt him\u2014and you. Today\u2019s homes, with their open-plan layouts and synthetic furnishings, are prone to blazes unlike the house fires of the past, which is why it\u2019s so important that volunteer and career squads learn the latest science on how fires spread.   Enter ALIVE, an online training tool developed by NYU-Poly researchers that\u2019s now being adopted by 50 fire departments nationwide. ALIVE\u2019s game-like modules simulate the real-time decision-making process and can be completed via computer, tablet, or smartphone\u2014allowing firefighters, many of whom work additional full-time jobs, to proceed at their own pace.   The best part? In addition to being cheaper than face-to-face instruction, the new training has also proved more effective, with ALIVE users consistently outscoring peers who have studied in the classroom.       Stop! In the Name of Reproduction   Imagine a biological stoplight that could halt birth defects in their tracks.   No such mechanism yet exists, but NYU\u2019s Andreas Hochwagen may have brought us one step closer with the discovery of an enzyme that plays \u201ctraffic cop\u201d with cell division involved in sexual reproduction.   Most cells in an organism contain two sets of chromosomes\u2014one from the mother and one from the father. But eggs and sperm have just one set, and they\u2019re produced through meiosis, the process in which maternal and paternal genes are replicated and \u201creshuffled\u201d into new combinations of DNA.   By studying meiosis in yeast, Hochwagen and a colleague found one enzyme that sends out a molecular \u201cwait\u201d signal to another that triggers DNA reshuffling. The enzyme acts as a \u201ctraffic cop\u201d by preventing the disruptions to chromosome replication that can lead to Down syndrome.       Secrets from the Antarctic Underground     On an expedition to the far reaches of Antarctica, an international group of scientists confirmed that, when it comes to climate change, we\u2019re all skating on thin ice.   Courant\u2019s David Holland was among the researchers who traveled 500 meters down into the underbelly of the Pine Island Glacier to measure the effects of the warm seawater currents melting its ice shelf from below. They found that the channel through Pine Island is melting at a rate of about six centimeters per day\u2014a startling finding given that the breakup of this ice shelf could significantly contribute to rising sea levels worldwide.   Holland\u2019s plan is to use the new measurements to improve computer models that predict changes in the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet. Understanding how glaciers melt will be key to figuring out just how watery our future will be.       (Impulse) Buyer Beware     Ever popped into the grocery store for a gallon of milk and walked out with a whole cartful of treats? Impulse buying: It happens to the best of us. But why? The Stern School\u2019s Sam Hui and colleagues recently zeroed in on the causes of this budget-busting behavior\u2014by videotaping grocery stores from the shopper\u2019s point-of-view.   They found that items that are on promotion, need to be refrigerated, or are high in \u201chedonicity\u201d (like chocolate) are prime candidates for unplanned purchases, and that shoppers who stand close to shelves or browse store circulars are more likely to stray from their shopping lists.   \u201cRetailers can employ several strategies to convert shoppers from passive browsers to buyers,\u201d says Hui. But it takes two to tango: The researchers also found that customers often leave room for unplanned purchases in their mental budgets.       How Obesity Leads to Cancer   Here\u2019s yet another reason to renew that gym membership: A third of the nation\u2019s new cancer cases this year will be related to obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet\u2014and Steinhardt nutritional epidemiologist Niyati Parekh may have the key to why that is.   In a recent study, Parekh explored the link between body fatness and cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, colorectum, and breast. Her theory? Obesity causes higher concentrations of both insulin and glucose, which can encourage cancer cells to grow and multiply faster than they would in a slimmer person. Going forward, she says, scientists could use these findings to develop lifestyle guidelines to simultaneously control cancer and address America\u2019s weight problem.   Meantime, just keep moving: Sedentary living, Parekh says, is a chief culprit in creating the excess body fat that can disrupt insulin regulation.       Can We Reduce Our Dietary Footprint?     When it comes to what we eat, the world\u2019s people can be divided into two groups: \u201cstuffed\u201d and \u201cstarved.\u201d   As Steinhardt\u2019s Amy Bentley puts it, \u201cWesterners are eating enormous quantities of sugar, beef, chicken, wheat, and dairy products\u201d\u2014and in addition to being bad for our health, that diet has bred overconsumption, leading to severe food shortages in parts of the world. Meat is so central to the Western diet that our \u201cecological footprint\u201d exceeds the biocapacity of the entire planet.   Reversing the trend will be difficult, according to Bentley and her colleagues , who\u2019ve written \u201cSustainable Consumption: Reworking the Western Diet,\u201d a TED Studies analysis that describes the genesis of the modern food system and offers alternative approaches for a sustainable future.   Their first steps for change? Interest in food origins and technologies that track food from \u201cfarm to table.\u201d       Stressing Over Stress     It sounds like the predicament of a Woody Allen character\u2014you seek therapy for anxiety, but you\u2019re too stressed to practice the calming techniques your therapist recommends. A team of NYU neurologists led by Elizabeth Phelps observed this phenomenon in a two-day experiment showing that even mild amounts of stress can thwart cognitive-behavioral therapies commonly prescribed to control emotions.     The researchers first conditioned participants to fear images of snakes or spiders by pairing the pictures with mild electric shocks, and then taught them strategies for combating that fear. The next day half the group had their hands plunged into icy water to induce stress. When exposed to the spooky images again, those with icy hands were unable to calm themselves using the strategies they\u2019d learned, whereas a control group made effective use of the previous day\u2019s training to reduce fear.       Thanks for the Memories?   It\u2019s the bread and butter of every police procedural from Dragnet to Law &amp; Order: Two witnesses give differing accounts of the same crime. Duplicitous accomplices aside, psychologists have long understood memory recall to be complex and sometimes unreliable. Luckily, rats seem to have the same problem\u2014which allows researchers like NYU\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Fenton to peer into their minds and better understand what goes on in ours.   By monitoring the electrical activity in rats\u2019 brains, Fenton and SUNY Downstate\u2019s Eduard Kelemen observed that when the animals explore a new environment, their brain activity sometimes matches that of a previous one. The findings suggest neurons carry stored memories, environmental circumstances, and current state of mind \u2014a mixture that might cause one to pick the wrong guy in a lineup but that can also, Fenton says, \u201camount to valuable insight and knowledge.\u201d                                                                                                                                                                      NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

The study, which appears in the Journal of Neuroscience , provides fresh evidence on the brain\u2019s role in communication.     \u201cOur findings show that the brains of both speakers and listeners take language predictability into account, resulting in more similar brain activity patterns between the two,\u201d says Suzanne Dikker, the study\u2019s lead author and a post-doctoral researcher in New York University\u2019s Department of Psychology and Utrecht University. \u201cCrucially, this happens even before a sentence is spoken and heard.\u201d   \u201cA lot of what we've learned about language and the brain has been from controlled laboratory tests that tend to look at language in the abstract\u2014you get a string of words or you hear one word at a time,\u201d adds Jason Zevin, an associate professor of psychology and linguistics at the University of Southern California and one of the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cThey\u2019re not so much about communication, but about the structure of language. The current experiment is really about how we use language to express common ground or share our understanding of an event with someone else.\u201d    The study\u2019s other authors were Lauren Silbert, a recent PhD graduate from Princeton University, and Uri Hasson, an assistant professor in Princeton\u2019s Department of Psychology.   Traditionally, it was thought that our brains always process the world around us from the \u201cbottom up\u201d\u2014when we hear someone speak, our auditory cortex first processes the sounds, and then other areas in the brain put those sounds together into words and then sentences and larger discourse units. From here, we derive meaning and an understanding of the content of what is said to us.   However, in recent years, many neuroscientists have shifted to a \u201ctop-down\u201d view of the brain, which they now see as a \u201cprediction machine\u201d: We are constantly anticipating events in the world around us so that we can respond to them quickly and accurately. For example, we can predict words and sounds based on context\u2014and our brain takes advantage of this. For instance, when we hear \u201cGrass is\u2026\u201d we can easily predict \u201cgreen.\u201d   What\u2019s less understood is how this predictability might affect the speaker\u2019s brain, or even the interaction between speakers and listeners.   In the Journal of Neuroscience study, the researchers collected brain responses from a speaker while she described images that she had viewed. These images varied in terms of likely predictability for a specific description. For instance, one image showed a penguin hugging a star (a relatively easy image in which to predict a speaker\u2019s description). However, another image depicted a guitar stirring a bicycle tire submerged in a boiling pot of water\u2014a picture that is much less likely to yield a predictable description: Is it \u201ca guitar cooking a tire,\u201d \u201ca guitar boiling a wheel,\u201d or \u201ca guitar stirring a bike\u201d?   Then, another group of subjects listened to those descriptions while viewing the same images. During this period, the researchers monitored the subjects\u2019 brain activity.   When comparing the speaker\u2019s brain responses directly to the listeners\u2019 brain responses, they found that activity patterns in brain areas where spoken words are processed were more similar between the listeners and the speaker when the listeners could predict what the speaker was going to say.   When listeners can predict what a speaker is going to say, the authors suggest, their brains take advantage of this by sending a signal to their auditory cortex that it can expect sound patterns corresponding to predicted words (e.g., \u201cgreen\u201d while hearing \u201cgrass is...\u201d). Interestingly, they add, the speaker's brain is showing a similar effect as she is planning what she will say: brain activity in her auditory language areas is affected by how predictable her utterance will be for her listeners.     \u201cIn addition to facilitating rapid and accurate processing of the world around us, the predictive power of our brains might play an important role in human communication,\u201d notes Dikker, who conducted some of the research as a post-doctoral fellow at Weill Cornell Medical College\u2019s Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology. \u201cDuring conversation, we adapt our speech rate and word choices to each other\u2014for example, when explaining science to a child as opposed to a fellow scientist\u2014and these processes are governed by our brains, which correspondingly align to each other.\u201d   This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (P01-HD001994, R01-MH094480), Chinese Academy of Sciences Fellowships for Young International Scientists (2012Y1SA0004), and a Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research Innovation Scheme Veni Grant (275-89-018).

Hear names like Scooby Doo, Spice, and K2 in a high school and you can be pretty sure students aren\u2019t talking about their favorite entertainers.   Synthetic cannabinoids, designed to have similar effects to those of cannabis and marketed under such names, are often sold as a legal alternative to marijuana, though they are more harmful. Synthetics have been linked to 11,561 U.S. reports of poisonings between January and 2009 and April 2011, and 11.4% of high school seniors reported using them in 2011. Which teenagers are most likely to try them? NYU\u2019s Center for Drug Use and HIV Research found that those most at risk are male, white, go out 3 to 4 times a week, use other substances, are regular smokers, use natural marijuana regularly, or have been lifetime users of a different illicit drug.    The draw? Avoiding arrest.     Location Location Location   Would you buy an iPhone from the wrong side of the tracks?   Residents of lower-income areas are often the most hard-pressed for extra cash\u2014and yet when it comes selling goods online, their very neighborhoods can work to stigmatize them as untrustworthy, researchers in NYU\u2019s department of sociology found .   In their experiment, they evaluated responses to online classified ads for iPhone 5\u2019s in 12 cities\u2014placed in various neighborhoods determined to be advantaged or disadvantaged based on census data. All other factors being equal, the ads originating from the disadvantaged neighborhoods received 16 percent fewer responses than did those from tonier ones. And the disparity was even greater\u2014about 21 percent fewer responses\u2014for poor neighborhoods that were predominantly black.   It\u2019s yet another example of how perceptions\u2014even false ones\u2014can reinforce disparities in economic opportunity. The rich get richer...     Stop the Presses!   Velcro. Penicillin. The microwave oven.   To that list of famous accidental discoveries we can now add an answer to one of life\u2019s most vexing questions: How many licks does it take to reach the center of a lollipop?   A group of Courant and Florida State University researchers recently came up with an estimate\u2014in the midst of a larger study of how materials change shape and dissolve in water. In the experiment, they immersed hard candies in a current, and found that the \u201csculpture\u201d that emerged as the candy dissolved took on the same shape every time, regardless of the speed of the water flow or the initial shape of the candy.   Their theory about how things shrink and dissolve has applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and for geologists studying erosion.   Oh\u2014and it takes about 1,000 licks.     It Really Is the Thought That Counts   That pricey designer clutch you just picked out for your sister-in-law? Don\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s not a big hit on Christmas morning, one NYU psychologist warns. She might have preferred a simple, functional tote.   It\u2019s no secret that the holiday season can trigger major stress over finding the perfect gift for loved ones. But Yaacov Trope\u2019s research suggests it\u2019s overthinking that really gets us into trouble: Gift givers tend to obsess over finding fancy presents, when it turns out that most people would rather receive something practical.   That means, for example, that an Italian food lover would choose a gift certificate to a medium-rated Italian restaurant five minutes from her home over one to a top-rated place an hour away\u2014something to keep in mind when tackling your shopping list this year.

You drink from it, look through it, and sometimes even cut your foot on it\u2014but what do you really know about glass?   For years the material\u2014and how it transforms from solid to liquid\u2014has puzzled scientists, because its particles are disorganized compared to those in metals.   Glass is a colloid, which means it\u2019s made up of tiny particles that wiggle a little in place. But with all that wiggling, how does it remain solid?   NYU researchers have crafted a theory \u2014based on observations dating back to James C. Maxwell in the 19th century\u2014that the particles move in a coordinated way, engaging in a kind of microscopic dance party within a structure just strong enough to contain the frenzy.   Such research could have far-reaching implications, as colloids are also found in milk, paint, and gelatin\u2014and our blood.     Strength in Numbers   In 2011, the U.S. government discontinued its color-coded system alerting Americans to the terrorist threat level facing the country. Since its implementation in 2002, the warning scale had never dropped below \u201cyellow\u201d\u2014a 3 out of 5 in terms of danger.   But many of us still worry about terrorism\u2014and our perceptions of risk can vary depending on how close we feel to our fellow Americans, Steinhardt\u2019s Rezarta Bilali found .   She surveyed 147 university students on whether they perceived Americans to be similar to each other or different, and then showed them a (fake) newspaper article about a national security risk. Those who believed Americans are unlike each other were more likely to perceive a heightened threat when they read the article\u2014and more likely to support the U.S.\u2019s involvement in the war in Iraq.

Beyond that first awkward \u201cbirds-and-bees\u201d lecture, many families aren\u2019t eager to talk about sex\u2014at least not in detail, a survey of parents and children (aged 9-21) by Planned Parenthood and NYU\u2019s Silver School found.   Of those polled, one in five parents had never talked specifically about birth control methods or strategies for saying no to sex, and 30% had offered no guidance on where to go for reproductive health care. For parents of 15- to 21-year-olds, 91% knew that their kids were having sexual intercourse, but just 40% were informed that their children were engaging in oral sex.    And though 61% of parents said people should hold off on sex until they\u2019re in a serious relationship, only 52% had actually told their kids that.   Time for The Talk, Part II?     See No Evil, Hear No Evil     For a child, is there anything worse than watching Mom and Dad fight?   Here\u2019s yet another reason frazzled parents should seek help in dealing with relationship anger and stress:   A study tracking 1,025 children found that adversity at home had varying effects on their ability to recognize and control feelings such as fear and sadness. In an emotions labeling task administered to the children just before their fifth birthday, Steinhardt\u2019s C. Cybele Raver and colleagues found that those who\u2019d been exposed to physical aggression between parents performed poorly, whereas\u2014surprisingly\u2014children who\u2019d witnessed only verbal aggression displayed a greater understanding of different emotions.   But knowledge isn\u2019t always power. Both types of clashes between parents were linked to kids\u2019 difficulty in regulating their own negative feelings\u2014which could put them at risk for anxiety and depression later on.     Tweeting Across the Aisle     Another election cycle, another chance for pundits to herald the increased polarization of politics in our brave new (digital) world: With the internet, the argument goes, we\u2019ve built ourselves echo chambers\u2014online communities where we engage with like-minded peers in discussions that only reinforce what we already believe.   Old news, right?   Not so fast, cautions NYU\u2019s Pablo Barber\u00e1. In a study of millions of social media users in Germany, Spain, and the U.S., he found that platforms like Twitter actually reduce polarization by exposing people to political messages they wouldn\u2019t otherwise encounter. That\u2019s because our social networks include not just BFFs, but also people with whom we have only \u201cweak ties\u201d\u2014and wouldn\u2019t choose to chat politics with offline.   Something to consider before \u201cunfriending\u201d a zealous acquaintance for one too many rants in your Facebook newsfeed.     Shy Is Not Stupid     True, but unfair: Teachers often neglect the quiet kid in the corner in favor of the motormouth in the front row. Because of this, shy children are at risk for poor academic achievement. But a new Steinhardt study found a way to help these overlooked pupils reach their full potential\u2014without pressuring them to \u201ccome out of their shell.\u201d   Enter the INSIGHTS into Children\u2019s Temperament intervention, which focuses on supporting personality differences instead of trying to change them. In a study of nearly 350 children transitioning from kindergarten to first grade, half the students participated in INSIGHT, and half attended a traditional after-school reading program.    While math and critical thinking skills of shy children of the second group declined, these skills improved in shy children of the first group\u2014 proving that being shy does not have to be a disadvantage.     Video Killed Objectivity     You\u2019d think that video evidence used in court would help everybody to see the objective truth, right? Not so fast. It turns out that everyday prejudices aren\u2019t so easily shed: A series of experiments by NYU psychologists and colleagues from the Yale School of Law showed that instead of challenging our biases, video evidence might in fact enhance them.    In one, 152 participants watched videos of ambiguous altercations between a police officer and a civilian, while researchers tracked their eye movements. A survey determined how connected participants felt to the social group of each officer.   Those who did not identify with the police officer suggested harsher punishments for his behavior. The discrepancy was also linked to how much participants fixed their gaze on each officer: The more they looked, the more their established beliefs about police misconduct were confirmed.     Risky Business     Play it safe, or go all in? Your gambling style might be determined by your brain structure, a study by NYU\u2019s Paul Glimcher and colleagues found. Specifically, it\u2019s a part of the parietal cortex that matters: Those with a larger volume in this part of the brain proved more willing to take more risks than those with a smaller volume there.   In the study, a few dozen young adults chose between monetary lotteries that varied in their level of risk while researchers conducted MRI scans on their brains. This is the first time brain structure has been used to explain financial decisions.   The same research team has also shown that as the parietal cortex thins with age, people become more likely to avoid risks\u2014something to keep in mind next time you sit down to a poker game with Grandma.     Nurses in Flight   As anyone who\u2019s ever suffered first-day-of-school or work jitters knows, starting a new gig can be stressful. That\u2019s especially true in demanding medical fields, survey data from The RN Work Project, a 10-year longitudinal study of nurses, suggests. Researchers recently discovered that around 17.5 percent of newly licensed RNs leave their first job within a year, and a whopping 33.5 percent leave within two years.   All the shuffling can cost a large hospital as much as $6.4 million, and can even impact patient care, studies indicate, leading to increases in bedsores and falls.   Still, not all such turnover is bad: There\u2019s a big difference between an ineffective nurse washing out and a highly competent one quitting, of course. And a nurse who leaves one post may do so to take up a similar one\u2014sometimes within the same hospital.     What Lies Beneath   Nearly half a mile below the Antarctic ice sheet, there\u2019s a hidden lake. And in that lake, there\u2019s life\u2014whole ecosystems, in fact, a team of researchers (including Courant\u2019s Knut Christianson) recently revealed in a paper for the journal Nature.   Don\u2019t picture ducklings and swans, though: The diverse community of critters the scientists found consists of microbes that can mine rocks for energy and use CO 2 as their source of carbon.   With funding from the National Science Foundation, a team of explorers used a hot-water drill to reach 2,600 feet down and retrieve water samples from Antarctica\u2019s Lake Whillans last year. The subsequent discovery of organisms in those samples raises questions about what might be lurking in the other 400 lakes and numerous rivers under Antarctica\u2019s ice sheet\u2014and on other frozen planets in our solar system and beyond.     Patience is a Virtue\u2014and Prevents Scarring!   Salicylic acid. Benzoyl peroxide. Toothpaste. Egg whites. Whatever you smeared on your face in an effort to banish pimples during your teen years, you probably forgot one essential ingredient: time.   Take it from Seth J. Orlow, an NYU dermatologist who\u2019s been treating adolescent acne for more than 25 years: There\u2019s still no overnight miracle cure\u2014though medications do work, provided you have patience. (That means not giving up when you don\u2019t see improvement immediately\u2014a concept his hormone-addled patients tend to have trouble with.)   Orlow is also in the business of mythbusting: No, you can\u2019t scrub acne away, he says. And stop blaming your diet.   Another piece of advice? Leave those zits alone! \u201cI fervently encourage all of my acne patients not to pick at their lesions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to avoid scarring, not foster it.\u201d     Hackers, Do Your Worst     That clever password you just devised for online banking? It won\u2019t protect you if your financial institution\u2019s database is hacked\u2014a fate that befalls dozens of high profile companies each year. Criminals outmaneuver encryption schemes by intercepting database keys or administrator passwords\u2014and after that it\u2019s just a matter of cracking into individual accounts. With computers that can check a billion six-character combinations per second, thieves can potentially decode about three passwords per hour.   That\u2019s why NYU School of Engineering\u2019s Justin Cappos and colleagues have devised PolyPasswordHasher\u2014a storage method that divides secret information into shares, meaning that to verify any single password, an attacker would have to correctly guess at least three of them simultaneously. In practice, this would take all 900 million computers on Earth working nonstop for longer than 13 billion years. So, you know\u2014don\u2019t panic.      Give a Hug, Help a Brain     Reason no. 20,746 to thank mom for raising you: Her touch isn\u2019t just soothing\u2014it directly shapes a baby\u2019s brain. Scientists have long known that parental bonding plays an important role in neural development, but a group of NYU Langone researchers have become the first to study that process in real time. They watched 100 hours of video of mama rats tending to their young, and compared the footage to brain scans from rat babies, or \u201cpups,\u201d outfitted with miniature wireless transmitters.   The takeaway? Brain wave patterns changed depending on whether the pups were nursing or left alone\u2014and researchers believe such variations caused by nurturing interactions with mom help hard-wire a healthy brain for life. In fact, when mother rats groomed their pups, brain activity spiked by more than 100 percent. (Awww.)     Gateway to Ecstasy   MDMA\u2026E\u2026X\u2014whatever you call it, ecstasy remains popular among adolescents and young adults despite an overall decline in its use since the peak period of the late 1990s and early 2000s. A recent study by NYU researchers found that 4.4% of high school seniors reported using ecstasy within the last year, with boys at particularly high risk for use.   Analyzing data from a survey administered nationwide in 130 schools, they concluded that previous use of other drugs was the biggest predictor of ecstasy use, drowning out other socioeconomic factors. In addition, girls and religious students were at lower odds for use, as were black and Hispanic students and those residing with two parents\u2014unless they were already using other substances.   Money matters, too: Odds of using ecstasy increased for students with a job paying more than $50 per week.       Monkey Match   Gazing into the eyes of a potential mate is a time-honored pastime of lovers everywhere. But what if that ritual also involved checking your partner\u2019s face for differently colored eyebrow patches, ear tufts, and nose spots?   Some types of Old World monkeys use those visual markers, which have evolved over time, to avoid interbreeding with similar species, NYU researchers have found . The anthropologists used facial recognition algorithms to compare 1,400 photographs of guenons\u2014a group of more than two dozen species of monkeys who live side-by-side in the forests of Central and West Africa\u2014to explore differences in their facial features.   The results showed that the face patterns of various guenon species sharing the same territory have evolved to appear distinct from one another, cutting down on the risk of hybridization and infertile offspring.     When Money Isn\u2019t Just Green   No one likes the feeling that there\u2019s not enough money to go around. But a new study by NYU psychologists found that a sense of scarcity can lead to more than penny pinching: In lean economic times, African Americans tend to appear \u201cblacker\u201d to whites.   In one experiment, non-black study participants were asked to view 110 computer-generated images of faces ranging from light- to dark-skinned. Those who\u2019d indicated through survey questions that they believed that \u201cwhen blacks make economic gains, whites lose out economically\u201d had a lower threshold for identifying mixed-race faces as black.   In another, adults randomly selected from a city park were asked to divide up $15 between imaginary people (represented by composite faces) gave significantly less money to the face that looked blacker.

Here\u2019s something you didn\u2019t see coming as a kid who dreamt of flying to the moon: Space travel could give you poor eyesight.   The nerves that move the eyes are very sensitive to changes in pressure in the brain, which could explain why astronauts exposed to elevated pressure in space suffer from visual impairment. Back here on Earth, weaknesses in those nerves can be a symptom of concussion or other traumatic brain injury.   That\u2019s why biotech whizzes at Oculogica, co-founded by Stern grad Robert Ritlop (MBA\u201914) and the School of Medicine\u2019s Uzma Samadani, are developing EyeBox, a diagnostic tool that uses eye tracking to detect problems in the brain.   The National Space Biomedical Research Institute recently funded further development of EyeBox through a $250,000 SMARTCAP grant\u2014used to encourage the development of products to meet a need in space and on Earth.       DNA Origami   Forget paper cranes.   Chemistry professor Nadrian Seeman and colleagues at NYU and the University of Melbourne are practicing the delicate art of manipulating shapes at a much, much smaller scale.   Using DNA origami, which employs two hundred short DNA strands to direct longer strands into forming specific shapes, the researchers created amyloid fibrils\u2014aggregated proteins as strong as spider\u2019s silk\u2014and a tiny nanotube (just one billionth of a meter in diameter) to house them. Their results are published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .   Creating two-dimensional shapes like these on the nanoscale could enhance fiber optics and electronic devices by reducing their size and increasing their speed.   \u201cSmall is so exciting\u2014you can make better structures on the tiniest chemical scales,\u201d Seeman says.     Move Over, Silicon   BREAKING\u2014 The Graduate was indeed ahead of its time, because the future can still be summed up in one word: plastics. The flexible, inexpensive material could one day replace the silicon used in computer and phone processors\u2014and thanks to new research by NYU physicists, that day is closer than ever.   Researchers focused on overcoming one big obstacle to making these plastic devices cheaply: the large amount of energy required to read information stored on them. (The trick is in converting data stored magnetically to light for fiber optic transmission.) In a recent experiment, they managed to transfer information between a magnet and an organic light-emitting diode, without electrical current flowing between the two.   The catch? Their device wasn\u2019t petite\u2014so the technology will have to be miniaturized before it can make its way into our favorite mobile gadgets.     Going With the Flow?   Leonardo da Vinci was onto something when he noticed that water falling into a pond created eddies of motion. The phenomenon he observed in the swirling currents is what scientists call turbulence\u2014and it remains mysterious to physicists and mathematicians even today.   Turbulence is all around us: the efficiency of a jet engine, for example, depends on it. But other forms of this kind of fluid motion are much less familiar. NYU\u2019s Katepalli Sreenivasan is part of a team of researchers studying quantum turbulence\u2014the very chaotic motion of fluids at temperatures close to zero. These fluids are unlike ordinary air or water in that there\u2019s no resistance to hinder their flow.   By studying these differences\u2014between quantum and classical turbulence\u2014Sreenivasan and colleagues could uncover phenomena not yet known to physics. Talk about making waves!     When Stars Die   They do not go gentle into that good night! Picture stripped-envelope supernovae as brilliant as a billion suns and gamma-ray bursts that launch particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Both are symptoms of stellar collapse, but astronomers so far have been unable to figure out which stars produce these types of explosions on their way out.   That\u2019s where NYU physicist Maryam Modjaz comes in. She\u2019s won a 5-year, $500,000 NSF CAREER Award for a scientific investigative method she calls \u201cstellar forensics.\u201d By studying the mass and metallicity (the proportion of matter made of elements other than hydrogen and helium) of the celestial habitats of the explosions, her research team will be able to deduce the makeup of the stars producing the big outbursts. And that , in turn, could help trace the chemical history of the universe.     Snapshots from the Mind\u2019s Eye     Who needs a police-department sketch artist when scientists can pluck a suspect\u2019s face directly from the mind of an eyewitness (no psychic required!)?   Thanks to advances in fMRI technology, a trio of researchers including NYU\u2019s Brice Kuhl are honing the art of mindreading. In a recent study , the scientists scanned the brains of six volunteers as they viewed images of 300 different \u201ctraining\u201d faces, and then repeated the process with 30 new faces. By comparing these new scans to the previous 300, the researchers were able to produce recognizable images of the faces as they appeared in volunteers\u2019 minds.   The pictures aren\u2019t perfect yet, but a more advanced version of this method could one day be used to help understand how autistic children respond to faces, to assess racial prejudice, or even to recreate faces from dreams.   Read more in the Wall Street Journal .       We Still Love You, BU   Alarming, though not especially surprising: People tend to dehumanize members of groups they don\u2019t belong to. NYU and Harvard researchers recently showed undergrads pictures of human faces that had been morphed together with inanimate objects (like dolls or statues). The students were more likely to deem a hybrid image as \u201chaving a mind\u201d if it was labeled as belonging to their \u201cin-group.\u201d   So a Democrat might imagine a Republican to be mindless, unless\u2014and here\u2019s the new wrinkle\u2014the Democrat views the Republican as threatening, the researchers found. NYU students who identified strongly with their school were more likely to perceive faces labeled as Boston University students as rivals, and were therefore more likely than other NYU students to report that the BU students had minds. The same held for ardent political party supporters who viewed their adversaries as threatening.     Waiting for the Phone to Ring   Even women seeking to date men who\u2019ll treat them as equals can be shy to ask those guys out, a new study by NYU sociologist Ellen Lamont found. She interviewed 38 female college graduates\u2014average age 31\u2014who described their ideal relationship as one in which partners equally shared economic, housework, and childcare responsibilities. Three quarters of those who had or wanted children said they had not interrupted or would not interrupt their careers to become stay-at-home moms.   But despite their egalitarian ideals, the women clung to traditional gender roles in the realm of dating: They said that men are responsible for asking women out, paying for dates, and proposing marriage. Many feared rejection when pursuing relationships, and expressed a preference for being pursued and desired. Take notice, rom-com screenwriters!       Tomes for Tots?   Sure, your baby could be the next great Tolstoy scholar\u2014but don\u2019t count on him to crack open War and Peace just yet. A Steinhardt study has busted the myth that, with a little help from educational DVDs and flashcards, infants can learn to read.   The researchers studied 117 infants aged nine to 18 months, some of whom received a baby media product\u2014DVDs, flashcards, or flipbooks\u2014to be used daily for seven months.   When the babies who\u2019d been given the educational materials were tested on their capacity to recognize letter names, letter sounds, and words by sight, they scored just as poorly as those in the control group, who hadn\u2019t been \u201cstudying.\u201d   The products did have one profound effect\u2014on parents, who in exit interviews expressed the belief that their precocious progeny were well on their way to literacy.     A Safer Fix   Nine percent of new HIV infections originate from drug use, and 70 to 77 percent of people who inject drugs have hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That\u2019s why researchers at NYU\u2019s Center for Drug Use and HIV Research have studied the behaviors of people who\u2019ve injected drugs for 8 to 15 years and not contracted these diseases.   Aiming to reduce disease transmission among all addicts, colleagues from the National Development Research Institutes drew on this 2005 research for a new intervention with 68 drug users from the Lower East Side. The program both taught safe injection practices and helped users reduce weekly drug intake. And the best news? Knowledge can be contagious. Researchers noted that study participants have been spreading the word on safer drug use within their communities.     Selective Memory   What\u2019s that phone number again? Some psychologists argue that there is a finite number of items that we can hold in our minds at once, while others insist that working memory is focused on quality, not quantity.   NYU\u2019s Weiji Ma recently scored a point for the latter camp by analyzing the results of experiments in which subjects were asked to recall one of up to eight colors they\u2019d seen a few seconds ago. The quality of memories gradually diminished as subjects were asked to recall more and more colors.   Ma concluded that working memory doesn\u2019t suddenly max out: We\u2019re more likely to remember \u201ceverything a little bit\u201d than to remember some things perfectly and forget others entirely.   Now what happened to those car keys?       Covet Not   Which relative should inherit grandma\u2019s wedding silver? And when a couple splits, which spouse gets the car? Such questions can quickly lead to bickering, as there\u2019s no magic formula for divvying up prized possessions.   But with a pair of elegant algorithms , NYU politics professor Steven Brams and colleagues may have devised the next-best thing: an \u201cenvy-free\u201d guide to dividing belongings fairly in divorce and inheritance disputes.   Unlike other methods that ask the two quarreling parties to give detailed information about what they want, these algorithms are efficient and simple to use. In the first, the two players choose between items; in the second, they rank their preferences. The algorithms are \u201cenvy free\u201d because each party prefers its items to those of the other party.   Does this guarantee there will be no hurt feelings? Probably not\u2014but it beats throwing dishes.       Straight Talk   Birds fly; fish swim. People talk\u2014but with just half a brain? A new study by NYU and NYU Langone Medical Center researchers has just upended the long-standing scientific assumption that you only need one side of your brain to have a real conversation.   Using data from NYU ECoG , where neural activity is measured by placing specialized electrodes directly on the brain, the scientists proved that speech is, in fact, bilateral\u2014it involves both sides. To isolate mere speech (talking and listening) from meaningful language (constructing and understanding sentences), the researchers had study subjects repeat nonsense words like \u201ckig\u201d and \u201cpob.\u201d As they spoke, the researchers observed activity on both sides of the brain. The findings were published in Nature .   These insights could lead to more effective rehabilitation of patients with brain damage caused by strokes or epilepsy.     Scandalize. Investigate. Repeat.   Watergate. The Iran-Contra Affair. Hurricane Katrina. Does that sound like a greatest-hits of American scandals and screw-ups? It is\u2014and there are 97 more. As part of his new book Government by Investigation (Brookings Institution Press), Wagner\u2019s Paul Light has compiled a list of the federal government\u2019s 100 most significant inquiries since 1945.   What do communists in Hollywood (1947), the Kent State campus shootings (1970), and steroid abuse in baseball (2005) have in common? They all made Light\u2019s cut, along with probes into Pearl Harbor (1945), Ku Klux Klan activities (1965), the space shuttle Challenger accident (1986), and President Clinton\u2019s impeachment (1998).   Light counts 20 investigations from the 2000s alone, among them the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 2008 financial collapse, and the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.   How many controversies can you name? See the full list here.       Elite Electorate   Voter turnout for U.S. presidential elections hovers around an unimpressive 60 percent. But who exactly is doing the voting? Most often, it\u2019s the rich: A study by NYU\u2019s Jonathan Nagler with American University colleague Jan Leighley found that nearly 80 percent of high-income citizens vote, compared to barely 50 percent of those considered low-income.   Studying data from every presidential election from 1972 to 2008, the researchers found that while the gap in voting between blacks and whites has largely disappeared, income inequality between voters and non-voters has remained stable. And election reforms designed to boost voter turnout have resulted in modest increases of just 2 or 3 percent.   Upending previous research, Leighley and Nagler demonstrated that voters are substantially more conservative in their economic views than are non-voters\u2014an imbalance that may well influence policy decisions to the detriment of the poor.       Sandbox Census   The stats on childhood obesity\u2014nearly a quarter of 6- to 11-year-olds don\u2019t meet U.S. guidelines for physical activity\u2014indicate that perhaps kids aren\u2019t spending enough time outdoors. That\u2019s why a team of Steinhardt researchers set out to discover who\u2019s using NYC\u2019s parks and playgrounds, and how often.   In 2010-11, the team examined 10 parks or playgrounds and counted 37,412 users, 53 percent of them children. While 60 percent of parents said these were the main places their kids played outdoors, there were significant differences among racial and socioeconomic groups: non-whites and those with household incomes of less than $20,000 were more likely to turn to playgrounds for their children\u2019s needs.   While the vast majority of parents were pleased with playground cleanliness and maintenance, some groups\u2014including Hispanics and women\u2014were more likely than others to report feeling unsafe there.       Who\u2019s Crowding the ER?   Anyone with the misfortune to wind up in an overcrowded hospital emergency room might reasonably look around and wonder, \u201cWho are all these people?\u201d   Not who you might expect, according to a new NYU Wagner study that debunked an urban legend about emergency department \u201cfrequent fliers.\u201d While it\u2019s widely assumed that addled drug addicts put the greatest burden on emergency facilities, the researchers analyzed 212,259 NYC emergency department visits and found that substance abuse and mental illness accounted for only a small share of ER traffic.   Instead, those visiting the emergency department most often were the very sick\u2014those carrying a substantial burden of disease, with chronic conditions requiring multiple hospitalizations. These repeat users were shown to have visited primary and secondary caregivers more often than the emergency department, shattering the stereotype of patients who rely on the ER for all medical needs.     Same Drug, Different Stories   Crack or powder? Not all teenage cocaine users are alike, according to a recent study by Steinhardt and NYU Langone Medical Center researchers.   Examining data from a survey of seniors at 130 high schools, the researchers found that 6.2 percent had used powder cocaine and 2.5 percent had used crack. Students who earned more than $50 per week were significantly more likely to use either form, whereas girls reported less use of powder cocaine, and students who identified as religious preferred crack.   Users of only powder cocaine\u2014not crack, as the stereotype would have it\u2014were more likely to live in urban areas.   Possession of 500 grams of powder results in a five-year prison term, while just 28 grams of crack carries the same sentence\u2014and yet the two are commonly collapsed into a common \u201ccocaine use\u201d category in research.       Precious Cargo   Here\u2019s something to think about the next time you see a minivan hurtling down the highway: the fatality rate for child passengers in U.S. car crashes is at least double that of other wealthy nations. About 2,000 die each year.   Vague and insufficient state child restraint laws could be to blame, according to a study by Steinhardt researchers.   Laws in Arizona, Michigan, and South Dakota only mentioned children under the age of four, though the American Association of Pediatrics recommends that kids keep using special seats until they\u2019re tall enough\u2014usually between the ages of 8 and 12\u2014to buckle up safely in just a seatbelt.   Other state laws didn\u2019t distinguish between rear-facing infant seats and forward-facing booster seats, and 33 states granted exceptions for commercial vehicles carrying children.   Making the laws clearer could potentially save young lives.       One Is the Loneliest Number   The middle-schooler, as anyone who has chaperoned an 8th-grade dance knows, is a highly social animal. But what you might not guess is that interacting with peers can also boost academic performance in traditionally solitary realms.   A study of middle-schoolers led by Steinhardt\u2019s Jan Plass found that playing a math video game competitively or collaboratively with another player\u2014as compared to playing alone\u2014enhanced both mastery of the subject and the student\u2019s enjoyment of the game.   \u201cWe found support for claims that well-designed games can motivate students to learn less popular subjects such as math,\u201d Plass said, \u201cand can broaden their focus beyond just collecting stars and points.\u201d   Students who played with others reported greater interest in mastering the skills the game taught, and those who played in a competitive situation performed the best of all.       Inhale. Exhale.     \u201cGot into an altercation with a guy in the kitchen....My initial response was to fight. Then I thought about the consequences.\u201d   Those are the words of a participant in a study led by the College of Nursing\u2019s Noelle Leonard, which found that mindfulness training can improve attention skills among incarcerated youth, leading to better control over emotions and actions.   Researchers followed 267 16- to 18-year-old incarcerated males for four months.   When combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy, meditation-based training helped the teens resist impulsive and risky decision-making induced by stress. The findings suggest that mindfulness could be key to reducing recidivism among young offenders.   Study participants were taught to focus on the sensation of breathing. \u201cBy repeatedly returning attention back to the breath,\u201d Leonard says, they learned to \u201cinterrupt the cycle of automatic and reactive thoughts.\u201d       Thoroughly Modern Masquarade   Kitten ears? Ghoulish makeup? Those are so last Halloween.   To get the hippest haunted look this year, you\u2019ll need some digital assistance\u2014in the form of 3D virtual masks developed by NYU-Poly instructor Mark Swarek and grad student Animesh Anad.   To wear one, you just clip a four-inch square barcode into your hair or hat, and friends who have downloaded an app can hold up their mobile devices to see your spooky skeleton skull or giant pumpkin head.   Using similar technology, 4,000 kids \u201cdressed\u201d as dinosaurs and monsters at the Brooklyn Art Fair recently ran through Prospect Park while parents watched on iPad and iPhone screens.   Swarek, a researcher at MAGNET and augmented reality pioneer, predicts that future gamers will get up from the couch and head to public parks to battle each other in virtual forts and castles.     Helping the FDNY Fight Fires? Yep, There\u2019s an App for That   What your firefighter doesn\u2019t know can hurt him\u2014and you. Today\u2019s homes, with their open-plan layouts and synthetic furnishings, are prone to blazes unlike the house fires of the past, which is why it\u2019s so important that volunteer and career squads learn the latest science on how fires spread.   Enter ALIVE, an online training tool developed by NYU-Poly researchers that\u2019s now being adopted by 50 fire departments nationwide. ALIVE\u2019s game-like modules simulate the real-time decision-making process and can be completed via computer, tablet, or smartphone\u2014allowing firefighters, many of whom work additional full-time jobs, to proceed at their own pace.   The best part? In addition to being cheaper than face-to-face instruction, the new training has also proved more effective, with ALIVE users consistently outscoring peers who have studied in the classroom.       Stop! In the Name of Reproduction   Imagine a biological stoplight that could halt birth defects in their tracks.   No such mechanism yet exists, but NYU\u2019s Andreas Hochwagen may have brought us one step closer with the discovery of an enzyme that plays \u201ctraffic cop\u201d with cell division involved in sexual reproduction.   Most cells in an organism contain two sets of chromosomes\u2014one from the mother and one from the father. But eggs and sperm have just one set, and they\u2019re produced through meiosis, the process in which maternal and paternal genes are replicated and \u201creshuffled\u201d into new combinations of DNA.   By studying meiosis in yeast, Hochwagen and a colleague found one enzyme that sends out a molecular \u201cwait\u201d signal to another that triggers DNA reshuffling. The enzyme acts as a \u201ctraffic cop\u201d by preventing the disruptions to chromosome replication that can lead to Down syndrome.       Secrets from the Antarctic Underground     On an expedition to the far reaches of Antarctica, an international group of scientists confirmed that, when it comes to climate change, we\u2019re all skating on thin ice.   Courant\u2019s David Holland was among the researchers who traveled 500 meters down into the underbelly of the Pine Island Glacier to measure the effects of the warm seawater currents melting its ice shelf from below. They found that the channel through Pine Island is melting at a rate of about six centimeters per day\u2014a startling finding given that the breakup of this ice shelf could significantly contribute to rising sea levels worldwide.   Holland\u2019s plan is to use the new measurements to improve computer models that predict changes in the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet. Understanding how glaciers melt will be key to figuring out just how watery our future will be.       (Impulse) Buyer Beware     Ever popped into the grocery store for a gallon of milk and walked out with a whole cartful of treats? Impulse buying: It happens to the best of us. But why? The Stern School\u2019s Sam Hui and colleagues recently zeroed in on the causes of this budget-busting behavior\u2014by videotaping grocery stores from the shopper\u2019s point-of-view.   They found that items that are on promotion, need to be refrigerated, or are high in \u201chedonicity\u201d (like chocolate) are prime candidates for unplanned purchases, and that shoppers who stand close to shelves or browse store circulars are more likely to stray from their shopping lists.   \u201cRetailers can employ several strategies to convert shoppers from passive browsers to buyers,\u201d says Hui. But it takes two to tango: The researchers also found that customers often leave room for unplanned purchases in their mental budgets.       How Obesity Leads to Cancer   Here\u2019s yet another reason to renew that gym membership: A third of the nation\u2019s new cancer cases this year will be related to obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet\u2014and Steinhardt nutritional epidemiologist Niyati Parekh may have the key to why that is.   In a recent study, Parekh explored the link between body fatness and cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, colorectum, and breast. Her theory? Obesity causes higher concentrations of both insulin and glucose, which can encourage cancer cells to grow and multiply faster than they would in a slimmer person. Going forward, she says, scientists could use these findings to develop lifestyle guidelines to simultaneously control cancer and address America\u2019s weight problem.   Meantime, just keep moving: Sedentary living, Parekh says, is a chief culprit in creating the excess body fat that can disrupt insulin regulation.       Can We Reduce Our Dietary Footprint?     When it comes to what we eat, the world\u2019s people can be divided into two groups: \u201cstuffed\u201d and \u201cstarved.\u201d   As Steinhardt\u2019s Amy Bentley puts it, \u201cWesterners are eating enormous quantities of sugar, beef, chicken, wheat, and dairy products\u201d\u2014and in addition to being bad for our health, that diet has bred overconsumption, leading to severe food shortages in parts of the world. Meat is so central to the Western diet that our \u201cecological footprint\u201d exceeds the biocapacity of the entire planet.   Reversing the trend will be difficult, according to Bentley and her colleagues , who\u2019ve written \u201cSustainable Consumption: Reworking the Western Diet,\u201d a TED Studies analysis that describes the genesis of the modern food system and offers alternative approaches for a sustainable future.   Their first steps for change? Interest in food origins and technologies that track food from \u201cfarm to table.\u201d       Stressing Over Stress     It sounds like the predicament of a Woody Allen character\u2014you seek therapy for anxiety, but you\u2019re too stressed to practice the calming techniques your therapist recommends. A team of NYU neurologists led by Elizabeth Phelps observed this phenomenon in a two-day experiment showing that even mild amounts of stress can thwart cognitive-behavioral therapies commonly prescribed to control emotions.     The researchers first conditioned participants to fear images of snakes or spiders by pairing the pictures with mild electric shocks, and then taught them strategies for combating that fear. The next day half the group had their hands plunged into icy water to induce stress. When exposed to the spooky images again, those with icy hands were unable to calm themselves using the strategies they\u2019d learned, whereas a control group made effective use of the previous day\u2019s training to reduce fear.       Thanks for the Memories?   It\u2019s the bread and butter of every police procedural from Dragnet to Law &amp; Order: Two witnesses give differing accounts of the same crime. Duplicitous accomplices aside, psychologists have long understood memory recall to be complex and sometimes unreliable. Luckily, rats seem to have the same problem\u2014which allows researchers like NYU\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Fenton to peer into their minds and better understand what goes on in ours.   By monitoring the electrical activity in rats\u2019 brains, Fenton and SUNY Downstate\u2019s Eduard Kelemen observed that when the animals explore a new environment, their brain activity sometimes matches that of a previous one. The findings suggest neurons carry stored memories, environmental circumstances, and current state of mind \u2014a mixture that might cause one to pick the wrong guy in a lineup but that can also, Fenton says, \u201camount to valuable insight and knowledge.\u201d                                                                                                                                                                      NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
