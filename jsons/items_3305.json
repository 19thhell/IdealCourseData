Students responded with enthusiasm to the events, especially to the informal atmosphere that encouraged conversations with writers whose work they admired. Several of the salons continued long after they were scheduled to end, with students and visiting writers caught up in lively discussion for hours. The Reading Series has continued every year in this tradition. In a typical week, graduate courses are offered Monday through Wednesday, and readings are held Thursday and Friday evenings. In addition to readings by today's most eminent writers and poets, scheduled events include faculty and alumni readings, readings from newly published literary magazines, panel discussions, and New Salons, which feature writers in conversation. The Emerging Writers Reading Series at KGB showcases graduate students of the Creative Writing Program and features established writers as special guests. The Creative Writing Program has been grateful to partner with long-respected literary organizations in New York City to bring diverse programming to our students and public. Co-sponsors and partners have included 92nd Street Y Unterberg Poetry Center, Academy of American Poets, Cave Canem Foundation, Granta, Open City, PEN American Center, The Paris Review, Poets &amp; Writers, Poets House, Poetry Society of America, Rona Jaffe Foundation, and the Whiting Writers' Awards.    Friends of the Reading Series have included Barbara K. Bristol &amp; Galway Kinnell , Tom Healy , Fred Hochberg , Robert Holmes , NYU Bookstore , Poets &amp; Writers, Inc. , Lillian Vernon , and the Lila Acheson Wallace Theater Fund of the New York Community Trust . The Reading Series is also made possible in part by the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.

Students responded with enthusiasm to the events, especially to the informal atmosphere that encouraged conversations with writers whose work they admired. Several of the salons continued long after they were scheduled to end, with students and visiting writers caught up in lively discussion for hours. The Reading Series has continued every year in this tradition. In a typical week, graduate courses are offered Monday through Wednesday, and readings are held Thursday and Friday evenings. In addition to readings by today's most eminent writers and poets, scheduled events include faculty and alumni readings, readings from newly published literary magazines, panel discussions, and New Salons, which feature writers in conversation. The Emerging Writers Reading Series at KGB showcases graduate students of the Creative Writing Program and features established writers as special guests. The Creative Writing Program has been grateful to partner with long-respected literary organizations in New York City to bring diverse programming to our students and public. Co-sponsors and partners have included 92nd Street Y Unterberg Poetry Center, Academy of American Poets, Cave Canem Foundation, Granta, Open City, PEN American Center, The Paris Review, Poets &amp; Writers, Poets House, Poetry Society of America, Rona Jaffe Foundation, and the Whiting Writers' Awards.    Friends of the Reading Series have included Barbara K. Bristol &amp; Galway Kinnell , Tom Healy , Fred Hochberg , Robert Holmes , NYU Bookstore , Poets &amp; Writers, Inc. , Lillian Vernon , and the Lila Acheson Wallace Theater Fund of the New York Community Trust . The Reading Series is also made possible in part by the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.

Look for events, postings and photos as we share our rich history and success.    Reading Recovery &reg; is an effective early literacy intervention that provides a second chance for students who do not get off to a good start in literacy learning. In 1989, NYU became the first Reading Recovery Teacher Leader Training site in the Northeast. 'Recovery' means getting back onto a successful learning path after a slow or difficult start and Reading Recovery is a short-term intervention designed to accelerate progress and lift achievement levels for the lowest performing first grade students. Students receive 30 minutes of daily, one-on-one instruction from a highly-trained Reading Recovery teacher for 12 to 20 weeks. In conjunction with good classroom instruction, Reading Recovery assists students who initially struggle with early literacy learning to reach grade-level performance in reading and writing in a remarkably short period of time and significantly reduces the number of children requiring additional services.    NYU now serves as the primary teacher leader training site for Reading Recovery in New York and New Jersey. Fairfax County, Virginia and Souderton, Pennsylvania are also affiliated to NYU. Since 1999, approximately 119,000 children have been served throughout the NYU site. NYU prepares teacher leaders who, following a year of graduate level coursework, are qualified to train Reading Recovery teachers in their local school districts or regions. The project is a cooperative venture between the university and a school district or a consortium of districts that have made the required long-term committment to implement Reading Recovery.    Descubriendo La Lectura (DLL) is the Spanish version of Reading Recovery. DLL works with the lowest performing first grade Spanish speaking students in reading and writing. The goal of this program is to enable these students to read and write within the average band of their bilingual classrooms. Because Reading Recovery instruction is in Spanish, teachers receive specific training in order to provide DLL services to children.      Read More Tributes to M.
