The Movement Lab, in collaboration with the New York Times, installed high-speed motion capture cameras in a studio of the Juilliard School at New York's Lincoln Center in order to study the movement of New York Philharmonic conductor Alan Gilbert. Using advanced computer software with new visualization techniques, the team transformed this motion data, tracing the intricacies of Gilbert's gestures for the Times feature \"The Maestro's Mojo.\"                                                                                                    The NYU Movement Lab's new Squidball platform &quot; crowd2cloud &quot;  will premiere at TEDx NYU on April 14, 2012. Squidball was first unveiled as the world's largest-scale motion capture game to 4,000 player audiences at SIGGRAPH 2004 , and continued all over the world, including Ars Electronica 2010, and many other venues in New York and California.
