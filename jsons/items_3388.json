Rebecca says, \u201cI had always wanted to live in Madrid, so the summer program seemed the obvious choice for where I should go abroad, to fulfill requirements for my major while gaining fluency.\u201d When NYU opened a site in Buenos Aires, Rebecca hit upon a way to integrate all of her interests. She applied for and received a Dean\u2019s Undergraduate Research grant to expand her research while abroad. She says, \u201cI was interested in the parallels of Buenos Aires to New York in terms of the heavy immigration both sustained in the 19th century. I used my time abroad to conduct firsthand research about Irish immigration to Argentina. When I immersed myself in the community, I was regaled with stories and given books and photos to take with me.\u201d This form of on-site research was a different experience for Rebecca, as she was able to compare her archival findings to the oral histories she collected.      Through the summer program in Dublin, she continued her research on immigration, all of which now forms the foundation of her senior honors thesis, which she will present at a conference on campus in New York. She says, \u201cI love New York, but my mental map of what constitutes \u2018home\u2019 has extended to include other places in the world.\u201d                                                NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

Some courses may be subject to the adjunct cap. For more information about academic requirements please visit the Academic Service page here .   All courses administered by NYU Law are evaluated with letter grades, appearing on student transcripts and counting towards the student \u2019 s GPA. However, courses offered and administered by the University of Buenos Aires School of Law, the partner institution, will not count towards GPA, only appearing on transcripts as credits earned, rather than as individual courses.   Spring 2015 Courses     Law and Institutions in Latin America (Three Credits)   Deals: Commercial Transactions in Latin America (Two Credits)   Transnational Credit and Insolvency in Latin America (Two Credits)   Clinic on Policy Advocacy in Latin America (Two Seminar Credits and Three Fieldwork Credits)   Dispute Resolution in Latin America (Three Credits)   Public and Corporate Governance in Latin America (Three Credits)   Directed Research: Students making previous arrangements with faculty either in Buenos Aires or Washington Square may receive up to two credits for research conducted while in Buenos Aires.     Language Courses: Students who have a working knowledge of the Spanish language will generally receive a greater benefit from their experience. Students are therefore encouraged to take language courses at NYU or elsewhere before participating. Students may also find it useful to take language courses offered by the Academic Center while studying in Buenos Aires. No law school credit will be awarded for courses intended solely for language instruction, however; NYU language courses will appear in transcripts.   Tuition and Living Costs   Students participating in NYU Law Abroad pay full tuition to NYU Law for the semester. Tuition will cover a full course load; students who wish to take additional courses may do so at an additional expense. Information about NYU Law School tuition can be found in the following link: http://www.law.nyu.edu/financialaid/budgetandbudgeting/studentexpensebudget/index.htm   For information about cost of living and other expenses please visit: http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers/buenos-aires/admitted-students/costs-budgeting/cost-of-living.html   Housing   Students can find their own apartment before they arrive by working with a recommended rental agency.   Passport, Visa and Residence Permit Requirements   Students should obtain the necessary passport and visa to study in Argentina. Students are able to coordinate the process with the Office of Global Services.

Stern School of Business students volunteered their time and energy in Costa Rica during winter intersession as part of Stern International Volunteers, a program that complements the school's four-course, social impact sequence. Our Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars took a January intersession trip to Peru, where they lived with host families and helped tackle health and ecological issues by installing clean-burning stoves, building bathrooms at schools, and planting trees.

Rebecca says, \u201cI had always wanted to live in Madrid, so the summer program seemed the obvious choice for where I should go abroad, to fulfill requirements for my major while gaining fluency.\u201d When NYU opened a site in Buenos Aires, Rebecca hit upon a way to integrate all of her interests. She applied for and received a Dean\u2019s Undergraduate Research grant to expand her research while abroad. She says, \u201cI was interested in the parallels of Buenos Aires to New York in terms of the heavy immigration both sustained in the 19th century. I used my time abroad to conduct firsthand research about Irish immigration to Argentina. When I immersed myself in the community, I was regaled with stories and given books and photos to take with me.\u201d This form of on-site research was a different experience for Rebecca, as she was able to compare her archival findings to the oral histories she collected.      Through the summer program in Dublin, she continued her research on immigration, all of which now forms the foundation of her senior honors thesis, which she will present at a conference on campus in New York. She says, \u201cI love New York, but my mental map of what constitutes \u2018home\u2019 has extended to include other places in the world.\u201d                                                NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

Courses are taught in Spanish and English by some of Argentina's most talented scholars, journalists, public health professionals, as well as renowned writers and musicians. The curriculum provides a cultural frame to coursework offered in subjects ranging from art history, cinema studies, and creative writing to politics, sociology, and economics. All students at NYU Buenos Aires take a Spanish language course at their appropriate level upon arrival or, if advanced, an elective in the language.   A place of renewed growth and prosperity, Buenos Aires is one of the most important financial and cultural centers in Latin America. The NYU academic center is located in the handsome Recoleta district, near vibrant Avenida Santa Fe. Staff members organize and offer a myriad of activities for students to take part in. Ranging from regional travel to destinations such as Iguazu Falls, Rosario, and Tigre to taking tango lessons throughout the semester. Volunteer opportunities at local NGOs and media offices open doors for students to engage in the community and practice Spanish. Museums, class fieldtrips, and concerts offer opportunities to go beyond day-to-day cultural experiences and better understand the dynamic past and present of the Argentine capital. Homestays bring the everyday Argentine way of living to life as students share meals, ideas and activities with their host parents.    A lecture series on topics such as human rights, vanguard art and literature, youth and political engagement, political economics and multicultural identity add precise perspectives to the expansive experience of this dynamic region.
