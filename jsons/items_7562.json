In this ongoing transition, a modernity referred to as Modernity 1.0 - characterized by traditional nation states - was transplanted by Modernity 2.0 - an ultimate form of globalization, where a compressed world without any boundary arose. However, such a compressed, globalized world producing the core notion of proximity, i.e. a world without any layer or distance, seems to no longer match today&rsquo;s cultural and economic developments. We seem to have achieved a state of Modernity connoting a world where multidimensionality and the novel notion of rooted cosmopolitanism has erased a totalitarian form of globalized proximity.     In line with this upcoming shift, the social ideologies, cultures and arts of Asia are actively exploring new connotations in cultural views departing from what could be designated as Modernity 3.0. Here the perspective of transgression and its culmination in the excesses of neo-liberal capitalism, mass-mediatized democracy, neo-libertine consumption, and planetary ecocide seem no longer valid. Rather the quest for agreement on the question of &lsquo;how to live?&rsquo; and the search for other forms of morality indicate a start for a topical understanding of solidarity and social order connected to a rooted cosmopolitanism.    The narrative of such a modernity should particularly stress the need for a worldwide cultural and cosmopolitan turn. Novel thinking and practice must contribute to designating connotations and values that could directly reglobalize societies, politics, economies, and cultures. An important role in this is reserved for art: based on multiple connections between Western and Asian perspectives, artistic thinking proves capable of articulating alternative models that can offer a constructive impetus for reassessing the concept of modernity.    The project Modernity 3.0 can be understood in the sketched context above. The first iteration &ndash; an exhibition at NYU&rsquo;s WSE 80 Gallery in New York - starts from an antagonistic display system that could demonstrate forms of cosmopolitan rootedness. The curatorial point of departure is based on a study of the status quo and movement of topical Asian and Western visual art scenes. Thus, Modernity 3.0 highlights the reconstruction of various cultures and their potentialities for relevant and exploratory concepts, vocabularies, and scenarios.    -Henk Slager &amp; Zhang Qing, Co-curators    Participating artists: Tiong Ang, Aglaia Konrad, Nikki S.

(Gallatin Building), Rm. 801        Course Description   Some of the most thrilling, momentous, and terrible events of the 1900s occurred in Berlin, which present tales of warning and inspiration to the present century. This four-week interdisciplinary seminar tracks these major events and traces change through the study of primary materials (literature, film, art, buildings, music, political discourse) and secondary readings drawn from a range of disciplines including history, sociology, philosophy, and critical theory.   Berlin's streets, buildings, memorials, and cultural monuments offer cautionary tales about the folly of nationalist ambition; inspiring sagas of intellectual and physical courage; cold testimonials of crime and retribution; lyrical ballads of brutal honesty; personal records of hope and despair. From one perspective, all of these narratives are episodes in an epic whose grand and central scene is World War II; this is the point of view to be adopted in this course.   Students will take in many of the sights and sounds of old and contemporary Berlin but will focus on the involvement of twentieth-century, Berlin-based politicians, activists, artists, architects, bohemians, writers, and intellectuals with the causes, experience, and consequences of World War II. Our period of study begins just before the outbreak of World War I and ends during the astonishing building boom of the post-Wall 1990s and early 2000s.   Classes, taught in English, will meet four days a week. Survival German language courses will be offered daily. Group site visits will occur throughout the week and on weekends but students will be given ample opportunity to explore Berlin and develop individual projects. Field trips will encompass the rich resources of the city's museums, neighborhoods, historical sites, memorials, and cultural monuments. Students will live in apartments conveniently located near our classroom and must provide their own meals.   Students are required to live in accommodations provided by NYU Gallatin.   Note for Gallatin students: This course fulfills 4 credits of the Interdisciplinary Seminar as well as the Humanities foundation requirement.        Eligibility   This course is open to undergraduate students of all NYU and non-NYU schools. Students must be in good academic and disciplinary standing, must have completed at least one full-time undergraduate college semester before the travel course begins, and must be enrolled in a college or university during the Summer 2015 term.          Application Requirements   Deadlines:     December 7, 2014   February 8, 2015 (priority for Dean's Scholarship; Gallatin students only)   March 1, 2015     Online application [APPLICATION HAS CLOSED; we are no longer accepting applications]   Personal statement   Transcript (non-NYU students only)     Reference contact information (faculty member or primary academic adviser)     Personal Statement   A 250-word statement addressing academic reasons for wanting to participate in this program as well as any experience living or traveling in another country must be submitted through the online application.
