Undergraduate EMT Courses      Managing Creative Content  MKTG-UB.0004 (2 credits)  Fall  This course will provide students with an opportunity to learn in great detail about the individual and collaborative services provided by professional managers both inside and outside the EMT companies. It develops a system by which to evaluate the quality of the service provided, the nature of the service and how these services are being implemented through collaboration with industry creative and business executives. Through discussions with and lectures by entertainment and media lawyers, accountants, talent and literary agents, studio executives, producers, publicity and advertising specialists, the student will understand the diversity of talents required to complete a project or product successfully.

It will explore the players who invest in production, why they are investing, and how these transactions are accomplished. Furthermore, the basic elements of these transactions will be covered: copyright exploitation, distribution, and the flow of funds. There will be an examination of \"real world\" transactions involving bank financing of feature films, distributor and producer co-productions and co-financings, cable television financings, and the funding of series for broadcast television. The course will also include a case study of producing in Canada.
