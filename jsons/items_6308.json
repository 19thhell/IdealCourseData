The course begins with discussions concerning author, text, and context that took place within the British and American literary circles of the 1940s, \u201950s, and \u201960s \u2013 clashes over the origin and location of meaning that challenged the ways in which artists and critics had traditionally conceived of their work. These debates led to broad reevaluations \u2013 sometimes quite radical \u2013 of the interpretive act itself within both the academic and public spheres. The course continues with close analysis of the so-called \u201cLinguistic Turn\u201d of the 1970s and early \u201980s, which both reflected and fomented broader shifts and revolutions of thought within the contemporary western world. The final weeks of the semester culminate with an exploration of critical interpretive trends today: theories of culture, narrative, memory, representation, power, disciplinarity, and interdisciplinarity. Students will emerge from the course with a stronger historical grasp of the interpretive theory of the past century, and will be challenged to use the course\u2019s introductory framework to identify and to develop further the theoretical underpinnings of their own individual graduate work. Readings will be applicable to all humanities fields and shall include cultural critics such as Bhabha, Butler, and Fish, as well as more philosophical voices such as Barthes, Derrida, Spivak, and Zizek. Guest appearances by Gallatin faculty will facilitate a broad interdisciplinary discussion of not only the theory, but its application in research and practice.

The MA program begins with the proseminar, a graduate core course that is taken in the first or second semester of enrollment, depending on the availability of the proseminar of the student\u2019s choice. The majority of the curriculum will then consist of course work taken at the various NYU graduate schools and can also include options such as Gallatin elective courses, independent study, tutorials, internships and private lessons.   The graduate program culminates with the MA thesis. Students begin the thesis process by writing the thesis proposal in the Thesis Proposal Seminar, usually taken in the second semester of full-time study, or after completing 12 units. Students then continue working on the thesis in Master's Thesis I (taken in the third semester of full-time study) and Master's Thesis II (taken in the fourth semester of full-time study), independent studies overseen by the adviser.

The course begins with discussions concerning author, text, and context that took place within the British and American literary circles of the 1940s, \u201950s, and \u201960s \u2013 clashes over the origin and location of meaning that challenged the ways in which artists and critics had traditionally conceived of their work. These debates led to broad reevaluations \u2013 sometimes quite radical \u2013 of the interpretive act itself within both the academic and public spheres. The course continues with close analysis of the so-called \u201cLinguistic Turn\u201d of the 1970s and early \u201980s, which both reflected and fomented broader shifts and revolutions of thought within the contemporary western world. The final weeks of the semester culminate with an exploration of critical interpretive trends today: theories of culture, narrative, memory, representation, power, disciplinarity, and interdisciplinarity. Students will emerge from the course with a stronger historical grasp of the interpretive theory of the past century, and will be challenged to use the course\u2019s introductory framework to identify and to develop further the theoretical underpinnings of their own individual graduate work. Readings will be applicable to all humanities fields and shall include cultural critics such as Bhabha, Butler, and Fish, as well as more philosophical voices such as Barthes, Derrida, Spivak, and Zizek. Guest appearances by Gallatin faculty will facilitate a broad interdisciplinary discussion of not only the theory, but its application in research and practice.

The MA program begins with the proseminar, a graduate core course that is taken in the first or second semester of enrollment, depending on the availability of the proseminar of the student\u2019s choice. The majority of the curriculum will then consist of course work taken at the various NYU graduate schools and can also include options such as Gallatin elective courses, independent study, tutorials, internships and private lessons.   The graduate program culminates with the MA thesis. Students begin the thesis process by writing the thesis proposal in the Thesis Proposal Seminar, usually taken in the second semester of full-time study, or after completing 12 units.

We live still with the political & social movements it spawned, with its music, with the intractable social & political issues it raised & with the powerful nostalgia it generated even while it was still in progress. It remains a touchstone for condemnation as well as emulation. The Occupy Wall Street Movement, for example, drew on the repertoire of protest generated by the student movement of the 1960s (which itself drew on the example of the militant labor movement of the 1930s). & critics of the occupation denounced its activists as dirty hippies & \u201960s wannabes. The first task of the course will be to determine what, exactly, we mean by \u201cthe sixties.\u201d What was the relationship between the counterculture & the New Left? Between the civil rights movement & the antiwar movement? Between an emergent women's movement & both? Between these mass protest movements & US domestic & foreign policy? Our second task will be to figure out why the decade continues to matter & in what ways. How, for example, are we to assess the legacy of the 1960s peace movement \u2013 its long term impact \u2013 given the record of the first decade & a half of the 21st century? Our readings will mix primary documents & latter day reflections upon them by participants and historians after the dance was over.

Through a variety of comparative case studies, this course will explore the ways in which different models of liberalism & the secular state impact the core values governing educational curricula & policy. The following themes will be explored: how secular education constructs or frames religion & how state education impose specific value systems upon students, whether state education systems have a role in teaching values, such as tolerance, & how this could best be achieved while still maintaining respect for religious diversity (through public, private or a combination of the two), whether secular education necessarily entails the provision of an environment that is free from all religious symbolism & doctrine, & the role of religious based education in a post-secular globalizing world order.

Common examples include geology, criminology & epidemiology, where the goal may be to identify patterning or clusters (\u2018hot spots\u2019) in the outcomes across the terrain being examined. In the social sciences, a similar set of questions & techniques are required, for example in studies of homelessness, poverty, environmental justice, & education. However, spatial data present a novel set of exploratory & modeling challenges, given the unique way in which outcomes are related (correlated) with each other through proximity. This course is an overview of the methods needed to analyze data for which it is suspected that the spatial component plays an important role.

Both seek to understand social phenomena through the identification of naturally occurring homogeneous groupings within a population. Classification techniques are used to sort new observations into preexisting or know groupings while clustering techniques sort the population under study into groupings based on their observed characteristics. Both help to reveal hidden structure that may be used in further analysis. This course will compare & contrast these techniques, including many of their variations, with an emphasis on applications.

We then discuss the problems with ignoring missing data & examine problems with conventional fixes. Single imputation with noise is contrasted with multiple imputation approaches. Real examples from policy research are given throughout. More advanced topics include pattern mixture models & handling data that are not missing at random      Course Page               20    2            APSTA-GE 2014            Topics in Advanced Quantitative Methods: Statistical Analysis of Networks           This course is an introduction to the analysis & modeling of network data. Network analysis is a key tool in understanding relational data - data describing the relationships between pairs & groups of individuals, as well as the global structure of relationships. We will focus on applications to & building tools for research in the social sciences, but the methodology can be extended to other areas. By the end of the course, you should have a working knowledge of basic network analysis tools & be able to use them to analyze your own data.
