The program grew out of a successful series of annual one-evening showcases of Tisch filmmaking, writing and acting alumni. The Web Series Showcase features original ideas brought to life by writers, filmmakers and actors culled from a pool of thousands of the school\u2019s alumni living in the Los Angeles area.
