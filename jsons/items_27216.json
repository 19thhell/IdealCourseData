From the   amateur stages made out of restaurant backrooms, street corners, and   cafes to the professional Broadway theaters, we will look at how access   to resources and government support influences strategies of   production. From the 1920\u2019s agitation trials (Agitsud), mass   spectacles, and agitprop theater during the Russian Revolution to   contemporary theatrical responses to disease, war, racism, and social   oppression the course will examine how theater has been used as a   reaction to social and political unrest, as a tool to fight oppression   (or a tool to encourage obedience and propagate national political   ideals), and as a respite from hardship. We will look at the   performance theories and strategies that emerged during these   theatrical moments, and we will read seminal plays that were written and   staged during these periods. Throughout the course we will ask the   question, \u201cWhy is theater often used as a response to crisis?\u201d In   addition to the historical and theoretical work the course will have a   practical component. Students will be asked to imagine how he or she   would produce a theatrical response to either a contemporary crisis   (i.e. the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, marriage equality, abortion   rights, health care reform\u2026etc) or a historical crisis (i.e. Civil   Rights, Vietnam War, sexual liberation, Women\u2019s Rights\u2026etc..). Finally,   we will look at how the artists\u2019 and activists\u2019 access to resources   influences the methods and products of theatrical production, and how   restrictions can often open doors to new and inventive performance   technologies.
