Solomon   Director of Master's Program   Catherine B. Klein Ph.D.   \u00a0   Master of Science in Environmental Health Sciences   The M.S. program in environmental health sciences is a specialized course of study providing students with the opportunity to develop applicable skills and expertise in a selected subject area. It is designed for individuals needing graduate training for employment in jobs involving worker health and safety, health hazard communication, health risk assessment, and environmental analysis of toxicants, including related areas of administration and technical sales. Potential employers include academia, industry, consulting firms, trade associations, and local, state, and federal governmental agencies. The expansion of regulations in occupational safety and health and environmental protection provides increased career opportunities for individuals trained in various aspects of environmental health sciences. The program can also provide secondary school teachers with the appropriate background to allow introduction of environmental science into their school\u2019s curriculum or into existing science courses.  The program of study, which may be full time or part time, emphasizes an understanding of how to apply appropriate scientific methodology to the solution of real-world environmental problems. It provides the student with a basic background in areas of environmental pollution, toxicology, and biostatistics and also with practical knowledge on how to present scientific data and how to properly interpret scientific reports. Beyond this, the course of study is individualized to the needs and interests of the particular student. To this end, students may take relevant courses in other schools within the University, for example, in environmental management and planning, environmental law, risk assessment, and environmental impact assessment.   \u00a0   Admission Requirements   Applicants to the M.S. program in environmental health sciences are generally expected to have a bachelor\u2019s degree in a scientific field, such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, or a related discipline. Exceptions to this may be made on an individual basis depending on the selected course of study. General admission guidelines are an overall GPA of 3.0 (on a scale of 4.0) and GRE scores of 500 verbal, 600 quantitative, and 4.5 analytical writing.   \u00a0   Financial Support and Costs   Successful full-time M.S. applicants qualify for consideration to receive graduate assistantships. Currently, these pay a stipend of $14,000 per year (2010-2011) plus tuition and fees.   \u00a0   Course of Study: Awarding of the M.S. degree is dependent on the following:   1. \u00a0The successful completion of 36 points of course work, of which at least 24 must be in residence at the Graduate School of Arts and Science. Some M.S. tracks require additional course work. 2. \u00a0The satisfactory completion of a special project. Depending on the student\u2019s needs, this may be either a library thesis or a thesis based on a laboratory project performed under the guidance of a faculty member.  The M.S. degree program in environmental health sciences offers two specialized tracks, with concentrations in toxicology and occupational-environmental hygiene. The latter specifically focuses on the recognition, evaluation, and control of chemical and physical agents in occupational settings. Some of the required or recommended courses for the two main tracts of the program are listed below.   M.S. in Environmental Toxicology   Environmental Health - G48.1004  Communication Skills for Biomedical Scientists - G48.2025  Introduction to Biostatistics - G48.2303  Principles of Toxicology - G48.2310  Organ System Toxicology - G48.2311   M.S. in Occupational and Environmental Hygiene   Environmental Health - G48.1004  Introduction to Biostatistics - G48.2303  Principles of Toxicology - G48.2310  Environmental Hygiene Measurements - G48.2035  Environmental Hygiene Laboratory I - G48.2037  Introduction to Epidemiology - G48.2039   In addition, students are required to attend Departmental Seminars and are strongly encouraged to attend Journal Clubs. Laboratory rotations may be arranged in consultation with the student\u2019s academic adviser. Most courses are offered at the Washington Square campus of New York University, located in Manhattan, and most of the research is performed in laboratories at Sterling Forest in Tuxedo, New York, about 50 miles northwest of Manhattan.   \u00a0   Housing and Transportation   The Graduate School of Arts and Science offers students a variety of housing opportunities through NYU\u2019s Department of University Housing, 383 Lafayette Street, 212-998-4600.

Medical toxicology is officially recognized as a medical subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties. In July 2000 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) established criteria for accreditation of Residencies (i.e. Fellowships) in Medical Toxicology. These criteria are rigorous and attempt to establish a baseline level of consistency in training among the extremely distinct approaches to training that had existed in the very recent past. The New York University based fellowship at the New York City Poison Control Center has received full certification through the ACGME's Emergency Medicine Residency Review Committee, one of the two pathways by which certification may be obtained (the other is through Preventive Medicine). Participation in the Medical Toxicology Board Certification examination, administered by the American Board of Emergency Medicine, requires completion of an ACGME-certified Residency in Medical Toxicology.   The New York University School of Medicine Fellowship in Medical Toxicology is a two year program based primarily at the New York City Poison Control Center. Fellows play an integral role in resident training and the clinical practice of emergency medicine at all Department of Emergency Medicine facilities, including Bellevue Hospital Center, New York University Medical Center, and the VA Medical Center.   The PCC maintains a laboratory capable of performing basic research techniques and has access to a facility for small animal research in the New York City Department of Health Public Health Laboratory. This is located in the same building as the NYCPCC. In addition, there are other extensive and accessible laboratory capabilities within the Department of Health and at Bellevue Hospital and NYU School of Medicine.

Medical toxicology is officially recognized as a medical subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties. In July 2000 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) established criteria for accreditation of Residencies (i.e. Fellowships) in Medical Toxicology. These criteria are rigorous and attempt to establish a baseline level of consistency in training among the extremely distinct approaches to training that had existed in the very recent past. The New York University based fellowship at the New York City Poison Control Center has received full certification through the ACGME's Emergency Medicine Residency Review Committee, one of the two pathways by which certification may be obtained (the other is through Preventive Medicine). Participation in the Medical Toxicology Board Certification examination, administered by the American Board of Emergency Medicine, requires completion of an ACGME-certified Residency in Medical Toxicology.   The New York University School of Medicine Fellowship in Medical Toxicology is a two year program based primarily at the New York City Poison Control Center. Fellows play an integral role in resident training and the clinical practice of emergency medicine at all Department of Emergency Medicine facilities, including Bellevue Hospital Center, New York University Medical Center, and the VA Medical Center.   The PCC maintains a laboratory capable of performing basic research techniques and has access to a facility for small animal research in the New York City Department of Health Public Health Laboratory. This is located in the same building as the NYCPCC. In addition, there are other extensive and accessible laboratory capabilities within the Department of Health and at Bellevue Hospital and NYU School of Medicine.

The elective in medical toxicology is available to residents from any medical specialty from any region of the country (and from most of the world). The rotation is organized and supervised by Lewis Nelson, M.D., along with the Poison Center and Medical Toxicology staff.   General Objectives   Familiarize oneself with the structure and function of a regional Poison Control Center.   Understand poisoning prevention techniques, including those for household, occupational and iatrogenic poisoning.   Develop information retrieval and problem solving skills.   Develop a general approach to the identification and management of an undifferentiated poisoned patient.   Gain an in-depth understanding of several commonly encountered poisons.   Develop an understanding of the role of the toxicology laboratory.   Reinforce the comprehension of pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics.   Learn to read and interpret the medical toxicology literature.   Specific Learning Objectives   Be able to understand and discuss the initial identification and management of a poisoned patient.   Understand the rationale and role for administration of oxygen, naloxone, dextrose, thiamine, and other antidotes, and understand the risks associated with their administration.   Learn to select the appropriate methods of gastrointestinal decontamination for a poisoned patient. Specifically, understand the risks, benefits, indications and contraindications of:  Cathartics   Whole bowel irrigation   Ipecac-induced emesis   Orogastric lavage   Activated charcoal     Define toxidromes for patients with opioid, sympathomimetic, anticholinergic, and cholinergic agent poisoning.
