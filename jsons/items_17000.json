Our PhD program in Chemical Engineering is designed to outfit you with expert knowledge of the field&rsquo;s core fundamentals as well as the latest research in its subtopics. By doing so, we further your specialization beyond a master&rsquo;s degree, helping you achieve superior competence in a minor topic within chemical engineering.   Admission Requirements   A BS degree in chemical engineering or a related field of science or engineering is generally required for admission to graduate study. If you earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from a foreign institution, you must submit Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and TOEFL scores. Applicants with degrees in other fields or from other colleges may be admitted with undergraduate or graduate deficiencies as evaluated by the graduate adviser. You will need to have had at least one course in differential equations.      Applicants to this degree program may be eligible to participate in   the Abu Dhabi Global Fellow Program .
