Reflecting this focus on undergraduate education, faculty members of the Department are chosen both for their outstanding achievements as scholars and for their dedication to teaching. We offer courses in the history of Western art and architecture from antiquity to the present and in a wide variety of other traditions, from Latin America to East Asia, South Asia, and the Islamic world. The former New York Times art critic John Russell called us \"the best undergraduate department of art history in the country.\" The hundreds of museums, galleries, and notable works of architecture in New York make NYU the ideal place in which to pursue an interest in the visual arts. Some of our courses are taught at these locations, in the presence of the actual works of art. Others draw on our vast slide collection and our new digital database. History of the Department The modern history of our department began with the arrival of Professor H. W. Janson in 1949. As a young man studying art history in Germany in the 1930s, he found that the Nazi government made it impossible to work with the leading scholars in the field, many of whom had been fired from their university posts because they were Jewish or because they were political opponents of the regime. Many of the dismissed scholars emigrated to the United States, and Janson followed them here. After earning his Ph.D. at Harvard he began to teach at New York University. He became chair of the undergraduate art history department at Washington Square (then known as the Department of Fine Arts) and also taught graduate courses at the Institute of Fine Arts on East 78th Street. Janson was a leader in the profession of art history, serving as chairman of varied organizations and committees, and editing numerous publications. In addition to his scholarly books and articles, mostly devoted to sculpture, he published in 1962 his superb History of Art, now in its seventh edition. He was also a distinguished photographer, especially of sculpture. In the 1960s and early 1970s, all undergraduates in the College of Arts &amp; Science were required to take a course in art history or music. A substantial majority of students elected art history. The students enjoyed learning the basics, art history became a popular major, and the department grew to meet the increased demand for advanced courses. Janson assembled a faculty distinguished for its combination of serious scholarship and committed teaching. This combination has remained a hallmark of the department ever since. Among the distinguished art historians whom he brought here were Jane Costello, Anne Coffin Hanson, Isabelle Hyman, Irving Lavin, Robert Rosenblum, Lucy Freeman Sandler, Gert Schiff, Marvin Trachtenberg, and Guy Walton. (As this list suggests, Janson hired women to teach at a time when art history was largely a masculine profession, except at women\u2019s colleges.) Present and former faculty members have published seminal books and articles in every area of art history, curated exhibitions at important museums, edited scholarly journals and books, and consulted on educational television and film. (Some of their publications are on display in the vitrine outside the departmental office.) They have served as presidents of the College Art Association and the Society of Architectural Historians and are Fellows and Academicians of leading scholarly institutions. The 1970s were years of dramatic change at New York University. The new Bobst Library, on Washington Square South, was completed in 1973. NYU consolidated its resources at the Square, selling its University Heights campus in the Bronx to City University. Phyllis Pray Bober, who had been in charge of art history at the Heights from 1967 through 1973, left NYU to become dean at Bryn Mawr College. Before leaving, however, she began to plan the creation of an Urban Design and Architecture Studies Program that would combine architectural, urban, and political history with studies of decision-making, technology, planning, landscape, and historic preservation as they affect the built environment of cities. After Bober\u2019s departure, her colleagues at the Square, with the support of a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, developed the program into a full-fledged major. Meanwhile, having seen NYU professor Peter Chelkowski on the TV program \u201cSunrise Semester,\u201d Mrs. Abby Weed Grey of St. Paul, Minnesota, decided to give NYU her collection of modern Iranian, Turkish, and Middle Eastern art. In 1975, a generous endowment from Mrs. Grey allowed the university to create the Grey Gallery on the ground floor of the main building (now Silver Center) and to begin refurbishing the art history department on the third floor of the building. Hitherto, students had attended class in uncomfortable rooms on the building perimeter, with the windows painted black so slides could be shown. The lecture and seminar rooms were now transferred to the interior of the building, while the professors\u2019 airless offices were traded for comfortable spaces with views of Washington Square. The department\u2019s renovation culminated in 1979 with the opening of The Grey Fine Arts Library and Study Center, where students could work in a well-lit, well-equipped room with comfortable furniture, reference works, slide tables, and (more recently) computers. Students have also benefited from the opportunity to learn about museum work by serving as interns at the Grey Gallery, which has mounted many important exhibitions. When Professor Janson took over the department, \u201cart history\u201d generally meant Western art history, although we did offer some courses on Far Eastern art, taught by Penelope Mason. During the distinguished chairmanships of Janson\u2019s successors, Lucy Freeman Sandler (chair 1975-1988) and Edward Sullivan (1990-2003), we expanded our course offerings to include the arts of Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the indigenous peoples of the Americas and the South Pacific. The requirements for the major were changed to include at least one course on non-Western art. During the recent chairmanship of Kenneth Silver (2004-2007), the department added specialists in the art and architecture of South Asia and the Islamic world. The Department anticipates further growth and change under the new chairmanship of Kathryn Smith (beginning in fall 2010). NYU\u2019s continuing expansion presents us with new opportunities and challenges. Attracted by the excitement of the New York art world, many NYU students are eager to learn about art history. As the College becomes more closely integrated with other parts of the University, we are welcoming students from Tisch, Steinhardt, Gallatin, Stern and other programs into our courses. We share faculty with Tisch and with the Museum Studies Program. An increasing number of our students write senior honors theses, taking special seminars on methods of research and writing, and meeting regularly with a faculty advisor. Each spring, the student-run Fine Arts Society organizes a Career Day at which professors, alumni, and friends of the Department explain What to Do with an Art History Major, discussing their experiences working in museums, galleries, auction houses, public relations firms, historic preservation organizations, architects\u2019 offices, real estate companies, and other organizations. Meanwhile, the Department is adapting to 21st century technology, transforming our slide collection into a database of digital images, setting up web sites to accompany our courses, and teaching our students how to do some of their academic research on the Internet.

The collections have developed over many years and at present number approximately 270,000 images (35mm slides and photographs) and approximately 50,000 volumes (books and periodicals). The main strength of the collections is in art of the western world, although there is growing depth in the art and architecture of eastern traditions, as well as pre-Columbian. The primary function of the collections is to acquire, organize and provide effective access to scholarly texts and images of works of art that are addressed in the areas taught by the Department. These areas include survey courses in the history of art, which are directed to non-art history majors, and major concentrations within the Department, which include the Art History major, as well as History of Architecture and Urban Design tracks. Funding for acquisitions and collections development is derived from the Department's operations budget, interest from a small endowment, in-kind donations, and limited project-specific allocations from the Dean of the Faculty. The collections are housed in close proximity on the third floor of Silver Center, which has been dedicated since 1979 to the teaching of Art History. Slide collection circulation is approximately 65,000 slides per year; approximate circulation from reserve readings only is 20,000-25,000 texts per year.    Special effort is made to ensure that all materials acquired are of the best possible quality, that they are maintained in a manner conducive to longevity, and that they are cataloged accurately and completely, and classified in a manner that provides logical physical access. Because slides and texts in the collection are needed on-demand to support the teaching needs of the faculty in the department, resource-sharing with other areas of the University is necessarily limited.    The Grey Fine Arts Library and Study Center is open from 9AM to 8PM, Monday through Thursday, whenever the University is not on holiday. In addition, the reserve reading room is available until 8PM, Monday through Thursday and 12PM to 5PM on Friday and Saturday during each academic semester.    User Information    The Grey Fine Arts Library is a teaching resource of the Department of Art History of New York University. The primary mission of these collections is to supply visual resources and scholarly printed materials to meet the teaching needs of the faculty offering regularly scheduled classes in the Department of Art History. Because great demands are placed on these collections, circulation policies have been established by the Department of Art History. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the necessary support materials are available to members of the Department of Art History. Requests for use of the collections may be made to the Librarian/Slide Curator. The Grey Fine Arts Library is a non-circulating reserve library. NO BOOKS OR PERIODICALS MAY LEAVE THE PREMISES. COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS: Slides and photographs from this collection may not be reproduced in any form by individuals, departments, or institutions. Books are not photocopied.    Student User Information    All students are expected to use the collections according to departmental rules and regulations. In most cases, there is no reason for students in regular and advanced (other than Seminar) courses to use the slide collection. If a faculty member wishes particular students to use slides for class reports, that faculty member should pull the slide for the student using the appropriate circulation card and return the slide immediately after the student's report. Students using reserve reading collections must request the appropriate material from the library proctor who will retrieve it from the locked stacks. Only material placed on reserve by the faculty is available to a student in that class. Library proctors may not supply books which do not appear on a course reading list. Any other requests must go through the Librarian/Slide Curator. Only Seminar students have access to the stacks. All other students must request materials through the library proctors. All students must surrender their NYU ID cards to the proctor in order to use reserve materials. Student IDs are returned when reading materials are returned. IN NO CASE WILL BOOKS BE REMOVED FROM THE RESERVE READING ROOM. No books, or sections thereof, may be photocopied. If it is necessary to photocopy reserve assignments for student use, the library staff will have done so. Photocopied materials may be removed from the reading room to recopy at a commercial photocopy establishment. The original copy must be returned, immediately, to the library. Reading materials may not be kept overnight, saved in student lockers, or reserved for later use! Violations of these regulations may result in denial of library privileges."}]},
