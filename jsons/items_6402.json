It is a phase marked by transitions, and involves significant preparation for what's about to come.             What courses am I required to take?     How do I register for classes?     Who are my peers?     How do continuing students feel about their classes and professors?     Where am I going to live ?     What is it going to be like taking tests and doing homework again?     Who can advise me on how to balance school and work/my relationships/life?                          While at Wagner *               Learning the Ropes   Once classes begin, you will encounter many \"firsts\": first day of class, first homework assignment, first exam, first advisement session, etc. During this phase, you will learn how to navigate the school environment while balancing course work and extracurricular activities.             Where are my classes?     What specialization should I declare, and how does that influence the classes I should take ?     When should I talk to my faculty advisor , and who are the faculty members that I should connect with?     What student groups and extracurricular activities should I participate in?     When should I think about an internship or a new job ?     Who do I talk to to make sure I'm not missing anything?                     Making Headway   By this phase, you will have managed to find your academic rhythm, and have a stronger sense of what you would like to do after graduation. You will be more focused on taking advantage of what Wagner offers that may be relevant to your trajectory, but still have a number of unanswered questions in mind.             Now that I've declared my specialization, what skills will I need to practice ?     What classes will best prepare me for a career in this particular field?     What internship/work experiences can I add to my resume to prepare me for employment in my interest area?     How can I use events to increase my learnings?     Should I take a leadership role in student group(s) or join professional association(s) ?     Should I be taking classes at Stern, Steinhardt, or the Law School ? And if so, which ones?     Am I on track for Capstone ?     Am I making the right choices ?                     Full Steam Ahead   During this phase, you are extremely intentional about your remaining time at Wagner. You are confident about the choices you are making and know what you need to accomplish before leaving Wagner. With graduation in sight, you are ready to prepare for life after school.             How do I best differentiate myself from others in the job market?     Which classes will give me a comparative advantage in my field?     How can I frame my Capstone experience in a way that is relevant to employers?     Which events will provide me the best opportunities to network ?     Who are the Wagner alumni best-positioned to connect me with employment opportunities ?     How can I help transition our student group knowledge to next year's board?     Where else should I consider applying ?               *Non-Sequential (Students can move between phases throughout their time at Wagner)   Learn more about IDEO's research on the student experience at Wagner.                    Post-Wagner            Fathoming the Depths   After graduating, you have the benefit of both time and distance to reflect back on-and appreciate-your overall experiences at Wagner. Furthermore, applying your learnings from school to the professional world allow you to asses the choices you've made throughout your time here.             What do I make of my experience at Wagner?     How am I different now relative to where I was before school?     What do I now realize about my experiences at Wagner that I didn't necessarily see then?     What did I learn?     What do I miss the most?     Did I make the right choices?     What do I wish I would have done differently? Do I have any regrets?     What piece of advice would I give to someone considering Wagner? A current student?     Would I hire a Wagner graduate ?     What does it mean to be a Wagner student for life? How can I give back ?                                                     \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}]},

It is a phase marked by transitions, and involves significant preparation for what's about to come.             What courses am I required to take?     How do I register for classes?     Who are my peers?     How do continuing students feel about their classes and professors?     Where am I going to live ?     What is it going to be like taking tests and doing homework again?     Who can advise me on how to balance school and work/my relationships/life?                          While at Wagner *               Learning the Ropes   Once classes begin, you will encounter many \"firsts\": first day of class, first homework assignment, first exam, first advisement session, etc. During this phase, you will learn how to navigate the school environment while balancing course work and extracurricular activities.             Where are my classes?     What specialization should I declare, and how does that influence the classes I should take ?     When should I talk to my faculty advisor , and who are the faculty members that I should connect with?     What student groups and extracurricular activities should I participate in?     When should I think about an internship or a new job ?     Who do I talk to to make sure I'm not missing anything?                     Making Headway   By this phase, you will have managed to find your academic rhythm, and have a stronger sense of what you would like to do after graduation. You will be more focused on taking advantage of what Wagner offers that may be relevant to your trajectory, but still have a number of unanswered questions in mind.             Now that I've declared my specialization, what skills will I need to practice ?     What classes will best prepare me for a career in this particular field?     What internship/work experiences can I add to my resume to prepare me for employment in my interest area?     How can I use events to increase my learnings?     Should I take a leadership role in student group(s) or join professional association(s) ?     Should I be taking classes at Stern, Steinhardt, or the Law School ? And if so, which ones?     Am I on track for Capstone ?     Am I making the right choices ?                     Full Steam Ahead   During this phase, you are extremely intentional about your remaining time at Wagner. You are confident about the choices you are making and know what you need to accomplish before leaving Wagner. With graduation in sight, you are ready to prepare for life after school.             How do I best differentiate myself from others in the job market?     Which classes will give me a comparative advantage in my field?     How can I frame my Capstone experience in a way that is relevant to employers?     Which events will provide me the best opportunities to network ?     Who are the Wagner alumni best-positioned to connect me with employment opportunities ?     How can I help transition our student group knowledge to next year's board?     Where else should I consider applying ?               *Non-Sequential (Students can move between phases throughout their time at Wagner)   Learn more about IDEO's research on the student experience at Wagner.                    Post-Wagner            Fathoming the Depths   After graduating, you have the benefit of both time and distance to reflect back on-and appreciate-your overall experiences at Wagner. Furthermore, applying your learnings from school to the professional world allow you to asses the choices you've made throughout your time here.             What do I make of my experience at Wagner?     How am I different now relative to where I was before school?     What do I now realize about my experiences at Wagner that I didn't necessarily see then?     What did I learn?     What do I miss the most?     Did I make the right choices?     What do I wish I would have done differently? Do I have any regrets?     What piece of advice would I give to someone considering Wagner? A current student?     Would I hire a Wagner graduate ?     What does it mean to be a Wagner student for life? How can I give back ?                                                     \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us

I spent a lot of time with kids in the classroom and learned a lot about their psychology,\" says Steinhardt graduate Judy Blume (B.S., '61). Blume earned a degree in early childhood and elementary education, and her novels have become required reading for generations of children and adults. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank McCourt (B.S., '57) spent 27 years teaching in New York City public schools. His life as a Steinhardt student is colorfully documented in his memoir, 'Tis. Steinhardt counts among its distinguished alumni artists Romare Bearden and Larry Rivers, jazz musician Wayne Shorter, playwright John Patrick Shanley, and lyricist Betty Comden.     Romare Bearden A 1935 graduate of the Steinhardt School, Romare Bearden (1911-1988) broke social and artistic barriers with his painting. He is best known for his collages that use African American culture to explore the complexities of history, music, family, home, women, and the modern condition. above: The Shepherdess, 1946 &copy; Romare Bearden Foundation/Licensed by VAGA, New York, NY.          The NYU Steinhardt Story    Founded in 1890 as the School of Pedagogy, NYU Steinhardt was the first professional school devoted to teacher education to be established at an American university. The School's early mission was to educate school administrators and prepare men and women for work in colleges of teacher education. By 1921, the School was educating teachers at all levels and across all fields--including the arts and health--offering them undergraduate through doctoral degrees. As the education field expanded, the School broadened its focus to incorporate new knowledge and scientific developments, and new programs emerged.    Today, through its 11 departments, Steinhardt offers more than 100 undergraduate and graduate programs. Students prepare for professional and scholarly careers in education, media, music and performing arts, nutrition, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, speech pathology, and the visual arts. Throughout its history, Steinhardt has been a vibrant institution responding to social change, yet it has always maintained a singular focus: to research and serve the pressing needs of children, families, and communities in this world of dynamic change.    Changing Times, Changing Fields    From the outset, NYU Steinhardt recognized the importance of diversity and innovation. Sixteen of its first doctoral candidates were women. Before the civil rights era, prominent African Americans were invited to join the School's faculty. When African American teachers in Maryland were barred from graduate study because of segregation laws, Steinhardt created a program that allowed them to earn their degrees at NYU during summers and weekends. When the nation worried about the rehabilitation of its soldiers after WWII, Steinhardt began preparing health professionals in the emerging fields of professional psychology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nutrition, public health, and speech pathology. When the \"medium became the message\" in the 1960s and the media arose as a powerful educative force, the study of communication and new technologies became part of the School. Recognizing the transformative power of the arts in education, Steinhardt integrated the arts into its curricula. Today, world-class artists, musicians, actors, and dancers teach, perform, and offer master classes at the School as a way of preparing the next generation of educators, scholars, and performers.    The NYU Steinhardt Mission    At the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, we believe that complex problems cannot be solved by one discipline alone. Interdisciplinary collaboration can help us find answers to perplexing questions. We celebrate the fact that physical therapy research can inform dance education, global media studies can provide insights for counselors working with immigrant youth, and scholarship in cognition can inform our understanding of music.    At this critical moment in history, when change on every level of society is affecting even the well-being of our planet, Steinhardt has defined its mission to address the challenges of this new era.    NYU Steinhardt advances knowledge, creativity, and innovation at the crossroads of human learning, culture, development, and well-being. Through rigorous research and education, both within and across disciplines, the School's faculty and students evaluate and redefine processes, practices, and policies in their respective fields and, from a global as well as a community perspective, lead in an ever-changing world.    At NYU Steinhardt, we produce social and educational research, inform policy and practice, and develop new models for enhancing the life chances of people of all ages and backgrounds. We seek to connect our fields in ways that enlighten and enhance our local, urban, and global society.
