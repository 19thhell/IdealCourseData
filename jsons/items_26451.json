Rather, special education refers to specialized services or environments modifications, differentiated instruction, adapted curricula or other supports, provided to students with disabilities. NYU students are encouraged to view all children and their families as individuals with varying degrees of skills and untapped potential for quality lives in schools, work, recreation in their communities.    Classroom, home and community interventions are designed to meet the characteristics, needs, and visions for a valued future of each child, not limited by traditional categories of disability. Respecting the critical role that families play in the lives of children, and the multidimensional nature of providing quality services for complex students, our graduates are prepared to work collaboratively with families, other professionals and the community organizations that represent the wide cultural vartiations characteristic of urban settings.    Integration of theory and practice is interwoven throughout each program, thus allowing graduate students to reflect, question and refine their knowledge and skills. Observation and fieldwork, plus student teaching placements, enable participants to practice application of their skills with children representing the full range of abilities and disabilities, in a range of settings, and withing the full age range of the teaching certificate.    Diversity of Programs    The programs in special education prepare teachers for positions working with students with and without disabilities from birth through grade 6. As described below, at NYU we offer M.A. programs designed to meet New York State requirements for the various teacher certificates:    Early Childhood Education (Birth through Grade 2)       For prospective teachers:       Early Childhood Education and Special Education: Early Childhood (ESEE, Dual Certification)          For those who hold or are eligible for initial/professional teaching certificates:       Special Education: Early Childhood (SEEC)             Childhood Education (Grades 1-6)       For prospective teachers:       Childhood Education and Special Education: Childhood (CSEC, Dual certification)          For those who hold or are eligible for initial/professional teaching certificates:       Special Education: Childhood (SECH)             Our Students    The participants in the M.A. Programs in Special Education very widely in age and background. Some were education majors, but many were liberal arts, business or fine arts majors as undergraduates. Some are making a career change. The diversity of the student population contributes to the richness of the programs. Consequently, program requirements and curricula offerings are designed to be responsive to the diverse backgrounds of our participants. Although graduate students have the option of beginning the program part time, they must be available during the school day throughout the program part time, they must be available during the school day throughout the program to participate in observations and fieldwork. Once the participants begin student teaching, however, full time commitment is required.    Financial Aid Opportunities    The Special Education Program is a participant in the New York City Board of Education incentive program, which provides tuition scholarships to candidates who are fluent in Spanish, Chinese, or French-Creole and who are interested in pursuing teaching careers in bilingual special education. In addition, the program frequently secures federal tuition grants earmarked for particular specializations within the program. Funds for all special grant programs are contingent on annual funding from the granting agencies.       Financial Aid at NYU Steinhardt       Career Opportunities    Graduates work in public and private schools, hospital and community learning units, hospital day treatment programs, group homes, and agencies such as United Cerebral Palsy, Association for the Help of Retarded Citizens, and the Young Adult Institute. Graduates have opened their own schools or established private practices providing academic and behavioral support to students with disabilities.

Teacher Education AT NYU STEINHARDT                 NYU Steinhardt's Early Childhood and Childhood Education programs prepare teachers who recognize the capacities, strengths, and needs of all children and their families in urban settings.    USA Today ranked us among their Five Great Colleges for Studying Early Childhood Education.    Childhood Education/Childhood Special Education, BS    The Certification Program in Childhood and Childhood Special Education is designed to prepare teachers for teaching in both childhood (elementary) and special education settings. Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professions to teach children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of instructional environments.    Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education, BS    The Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education is designed to prepare teachers for infant-toddler, pre-K, or grade K-2 general education or special education programs. Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professionals, as well as professionals from related disciplines to provide learning opportunities for children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of settings.    Early Childhood Education, MA    The Early Childhood Education Program reflects three central themes: creating quality care for all children through the development of strong relationships with families and their communities; developing teaching practice as reflective practitioners and teacher researchers; and a commitment to social justice for young children and their families.    Childhood Education, MA    The Childhood Education Program views the following themes as central to its curriculum: understanding learning, the learner, communities of learners, and the contexts in which learning occurs; understanding the nature, structure, and tools of inquiry of the disciplines taught; and using knowledge of pedagogy to create and adapt supportive learning environments based on formal and informal assessments.      Early Childhood &amp; Childhood Education, PhD    NYU Steinhardt's Department of Teaching and Learning welcomes applications from individuals seeking a rigorous doctoral program in Early Childhood and Childhood Education. Its focus is the preparation of researchers and educators dedicated to improving children's access to equitable opportunities for learning from birth through elementary school.

Observation and fieldwork, plus student teaching placements, enable participants to practice application of their skills with children representing the full range of abilities and disabilities, in a range of settings, and withing the full age range of the teaching certificate.    Diversity of Programs    The programs in special education prepare teachers for positions working with students with and without disabilities from birth through grade 6. As described below, at NYU we offer M.A. programs designed to meet New York State requirements for the various teacher certificates:    Early Childhood Education (Birth through Grade 2)       For prospective teachers:       Early Childhood Education and Special Education: Early Childhood (ESEE, Dual Certification)          For those who hold or are eligible for initial/professional teaching certificates:       Special Education: Early Childhood (SEEC)             Childhood Education (Grades 1-6)       For prospective teachers:       Childhood Education and Special Education: Childhood (CSEC, Dual certification)          For those who hold or are eligible for initial/professional teaching certificates:       Special Education: Childhood (SECH)             Our Students    The participants in the M.A. Programs in Special Education very widely in age and background. Some were education majors, but many were liberal arts, business or fine arts majors as undergraduates. Some are making a career change. The diversity of the student population contributes to the richness of the programs. Consequently, program requirements and curricula offerings are designed to be responsive to the diverse backgrounds of our participants. Although graduate students have the option of beginning the program part time, they must be available during the school day throughout the program part time, they must be available during the school day throughout the program to participate in observations and fieldwork. Once the participants begin student teaching, however, full time commitment is required.    Financial Aid Opportunities    The Special Education Program is a participant in the New York City Board of Education incentive program, which provides tuition scholarships to candidates who are fluent in Spanish, Chinese, or French-Creole and who are interested in pursuing teaching careers in bilingual special education. In addition, the program frequently secures federal tuition grants earmarked for particular specializations within the program. Funds for all special grant programs are contingent on annual funding from the granting agencies.       Financial Aid at NYU Steinhardt       Career Opportunities    Graduates work in public and private schools, hospital and community learning units, hospital day treatment programs, group homes, and agencies such as United Cerebral Palsy, Association for the Help of Retarded Citizens, and the Young Adult Institute. Graduates have opened their own schools or established private practices providing academic and behavioral support to students with disabilities.

To meet this challenge, we have created two dual certification programs that are at the cutting edge of the profession:       Childhood Education and Childhood Special Education (Grades 1-6)    Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education (Birth-Grade 2)       This design recognizes that whether our graduates choose to work in general education settings, special education settings, or inclusive settings, they need to share a set of common understandings. Thus, our students acquire a firm knowledge base in human development and variability in development. They acquire knowledge and skills for providing enriching, child-centered educational environments and learn how to adapt those environments to meet the needs of the diverse students in their classes.    Graduates from these dual certification programs share visions for their students. They acquire the collaborative skills to realize those visions with teachers, parents, and other education and health professionals. In short, NYU's integrated, dual certification programs model the process its graduates will use throughout their careers.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.     NYU Steinhardt Graduates in Education Ranked among the Highest Paid by USA Today      How to Apply      asd nest support project at NYU Steinhardt          BS Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education     Opening Doors and Supporting the Diverse Needs of Learners    The Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education is designed to prepare teachers for infant-toddler, pre-K, or grade K-2 general education or special education programs. Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professionals, as well as professionals from related disciplines to provide learning opportunities for children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of settings.    Focusing on How Children Learn and Develop    Our Teacher Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education within the Department of Teaching and Learning is an urban-centered and field-based program that gives a thorough command of an integrated curriculum grounded in a deep understanding of children's growth and development, with an emphasis on human variability. You will have practical experience in the field, and you will gain mastery of the various content areas of the elementary curriculum (mathematics, science, social studies, and language arts), as well as learn to create and adapt learning environments that allow all children to grow to their maximum potential.    Strong Emphasis on the Liberal Arts    A solid foundation in a wide range of liberal arts subjects and expertise in one area of the liberal arts are critical to your development as a first-rate teacher. With our liberal arts core and the 30-point liberal arts concentration required by New York State for teacher certification, our baccalaureate program ensures that you will receive the best possible preparation to be a teacher. For your liberal arts concentration, choose from such areas as history, literature, science, mathematics, and from many other offerings in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the College of Arts and Science. Your knowledge of teaching children will be supported by courses in human development, educational foundations, and inquiry-based education.    Study Abroad    We strongly encourage study abroad for all students. London, UK and Accra, Ghana are our academic partner sites. We offer the required course Human Development through NYU in London and NYU-Accra for teacher education students. The course includes weekly observations in British or Ghanaian schools and classrooms for first-hand learning in the local context. Students typically combine this course with three liberal-arts electives for an unforgettable semester-long experience.    Students may also spend a semester abroad at one of NYU's many other study abroad sites .    Student Activities    From your first year, your involvement in departmental activities will round out your learning. You may join the Special Education Club, which is a chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children. You may also take advantage of various departmental seminars and social activities concerned with the education of children. Students are also encouraged to join Steinhardt's Undergraduate Student Government.    Education in Comparative Perspectives    You are strongly encouraged to spend a semester abroad in one of NYU's many study abroad sites in Paris, Madrid, Florence, Berlin, London, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Prague, or Ghana. NYU in London offers a special course for teacher education students that takes them to British schools and classrooms for observation and firsthand learning.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.        Senior Honors    Qualified seniors who wish to pursue a guided research in an area of educational   inquiry may participate in a special yearlong seminar called Honors Research   in Teaching and Learning. Working with the faculty instructor, students are   guided through the process of selecting a topic of inquiry, developing research   questions, choosing and implementing appropriate methodologies, building   outlines, developing bibliographies and writing literature reviews, and preparing   drafts. The seminar meets regularly during the first semester as students   develop their questions and projects. During the second semester, each student   works independently on a project under the direction of his or her own faculty   supervisor, with whom the student holds regular meetings. Students meet periodically   with their seminar classmates to share their research and findings as they   refine and complete their final projects.
