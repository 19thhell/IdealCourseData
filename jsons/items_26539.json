Simoncelli                  What is a \"Visual Texture\"?      There is a long history of research in the study of visual texture , but the definition is rather imprecise. Most researchers agree that an image of visual texture should be spatially homogeneous,  and typically contains repeated structures, often with some random variation (e.g., random positions, orientations or colors). This loose definition suggests that textures might best be synthesized by laying down texture elements at periodic  or random locations within an image. But this approach does not lend itself well to the  analysis of texture images.       Texture Representation     Loosely stated, our goal is to establish a minimal set of statistical measurements such that two textures are identical in appearance if and only if they agree on these measurements. This definition is perceptual, and was first proposed by Bela Julesz in the 1960's. Julesz studied this by examining binary (black and white) images with matching pairwise, and later, triplet pixel statistics. Our model uses statistics that are inspired by the representations used by the early stages of the human visual system.  We first decompose an example texture image using multi-scale oriented linear filters (specifically, we use a Steerable Pyramid ). The resulting coefficients are complex-valued: the real and imaginary parts correspond to even and odd-symmetric (quadrature pair) filters. For each pair of coefficients at nearby positions, orientations and scales, we then measure the average value of their product, the product of their magnitudes, and their relative phase. We also measure a few statistical moments of the pixel distribution  (sample mean, variance, skew, kurtosis, range).  The number of parameters depends on the number of subbands, and the size of spatial neighborhoods used. For the examples given below, we used a total of 710 parameters. This is a maximal set: For each individual texture, one can usually get good results with a small subset of these parameters (with different textures requiring different subsets).      Texture Synthesis    Texture synthesis provides a stringent test of the quality of a texture representation (much more so than commonly-used classification tasks). We have developed a method of synthesizing a random texture that matches  the statistics of any given reference image. Astractly, these images are samples from the equivalence class of all images that share those statistics. Starting with an image of Gaussian white noise, we alternate  between 1) constructing the steerable pyramid and  forcing the sample statistics of each subband to match those of a reference texture image, 2) reconstructing an image from the pyramid, and forcing the sample statistics of the resulting pixels to match those of the reference image. We enforce the statistical constraints by moving in the direction of the gradient of the constraint function until the constraint is satisfied. Note that apart from the choice of initial image, the algorithm is deterministic.   Details may be found in the references given below.
