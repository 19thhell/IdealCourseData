The department offers a major in German Literature and Culture as well as a minor in German Language. One can also pursue a joint major in German and Linguistics.    Along with its German language program, the department offers interdisciplinary courses taught in English that address issues of German culture, history, philosophy, art, and literature for students who do not have German language skills.    The department sponsors a Brown Bag lunch series, semester parties, two student clubs, \u201cGoethes Tisch\u201d and \u201cImmersion Club,\u201d as well as a series of annual awards in recognition of outstanding achievement by undergraduate students in the study of German language and literature. Deutsches Haus, the German cultural center at NYU, provides a rich program of films, concerts, lectures, workshops, and exhibitions.    The Department of German places high priority on fostering personal contact between faculty and students, maintains relatively small class sizes (15 or fewer students, on average), and offers comfortable spaces for socializing, studying, and holding informal meetings. Advanced courses and some basic language courses are taught by full-time faculty members, all of whom are also involved in student advising.
