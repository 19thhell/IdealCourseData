[{"detail": [{"content": "Christopher Kucinski - Cellular Automata Synth              Elementary Cellular Automata Frequency Modulation Synthesizer      A chimera-esque electronic musical instrument begotten of cellular automata, frequency modulation synthesis, and a unique musical interface.          This polyphonic musical instrument uses the 256 rules of Wolfram's elementary cellular automata to modulate four octaves of notes. As notes are played on the four ribbon controllers (red-orange strips), the chosen cellular automata (CA) rule modulates the notes in real time based on how many cells are 'alive' in a generation. Rules are changed by the keypad on the left. Speed of generation and generation width and length are easily controllable; as are harmonicity and distortion. A small LCD screen displays the rule number and pattern of the CA as it generates in real-time allowing a musician to play in time with the CA.   The CA are used as another oscillator in the two-oscillator system of frequency modulation synthesis. The CA will generate through the musician-chosen number of generations and then reset to the 'single cell' initial condition.

The Lab is equipped with 19 digital audio workstations and a teaching position, and two modular analog synthesizers. Students begin to learn the art of music production in the Lab, as well as advanced music production and programming. In addition to the Lab, there are two personal edit suites available for student use. The digital audio workstations in the suites are equipped similarly to the studio\u2019s computers.
