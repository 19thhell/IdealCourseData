NYU Wagner promotes learning in public and nonprofit settings across management, finance, policy, urban planning, health, and international affairs. SNEAC provides a bridge between these disciplines and both the local and national arts and cultural sector. Arts and culture are critical to a forward thinking society, and SNEAC aims to raise their importance and effectiveness within public policy and administration.   SNEAC promotes professional development and leadership within various cultural industries including, but not limited to, visual and performing arts, fashion and design, digital media, arts-in-education, community arts/culture, and philanthropy and the arts.   SNEAC engenders conversation on current trends and practices in arts management and cultural policy through discussion panels, career events, brown bag discussions, volunteering, institutional tours, and networking events. To date, themes and topics have explored the intersection of cultural policy with other policy fields; arts management issues; economic impact of the arts; social entrepreneurship; international cultural exchange; and arts and urban revitalization.   In April 2005, SNEAC received the NYU Presidential Service Award for programming.

Students benefit from collections of costumes, accessories, and related objects at leading institutions, including the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum; Museum of the City of New York, and the New-York Historical Society. The internship component of the program enables students to gain firsthand work experience and make valuable professional contacts.
