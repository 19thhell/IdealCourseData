Our training is designed to prepare young singers for professional careers in recital and concert performance as well as opera. Our goal is that each singer leave our program with a solid foundation of healthy vocal technique combined with the freedom of musical and dramatic expression. Upon this foundation, graduates of this program have built successful careers in the world of opera, music theatre and popular music.    The Classical Voice curriculum requires extensive training in private voice, acting, diction for singers, song repertoire, and movement as well as the core courses for the serious study of music: music theory, aural comprehension, keyboard skills, and music history.

Mission Statement and Student Learning Objectives    The Master of Music program in Vocal Performance is designed to provide singers with a solid foundation of healthy vocal technique on which they can build a career in whatever area of voice performance they might choose to pursue. It is the goal of the program that each student achieve a level of performance excellence that makes it possible for that student to enter the field of professional vocal performance. In order to accomplish that goal, each student must demonstrate a technical foundation in vocal production that will allow that student&rsquo;s voice to evolve in an efficient and healthy manner throughout the years that follow that student&rsquo;s training at NYU. In addition, each student must demonstrate a respect for of the value of the text &ndash; the words that are sung as well as the sounds that are made &ndash; along with an demonstrable understanding that the best singing is an amalgamation of a freely produced sound and a personal need to communicate.    Course Work and Requirements    Course work includes classes in opera performance and classical song repertoire as well as training in voice with leading vocalists from New York's professional community. Acting and dance classes are conducted by working professionals in the industry, and classes are offered in foreign language diction, vocal production, and Alexander Technique. Classical Voice majors have the opportunity to cross traditional lines and benefit from the opportunity to participate in music theatre workshops as well as fully staged music theatre productions. The degree requires a total of 36 credits and can be completed in three semesters. All masters candidates perform a graduate recital as their terminal degree experience. Our department's programs in Music Technology, Music Business, and Music Education provide students with elective courses that further prepare them for employment opportunities in the world of professional music performance.

Our curriculum is designed for the accomplished young singer who seeks a program that integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. Our goal is to provide singers with a solid foundation of healthy vocal technique on which they can build a career in whatever area of performance they might choose to pursue.    Performance Skills    The classical voice curriculum requires extensive training in private voice, acting, diction for singers, song repertoire, and movement as well as the core courses for the serious study of music - music theory, aural comprehension, keyboard skills, and music history.
