The purpose of this evaluation is for us to learn where you are in your own dance/movement life. Are you a serious dancer with years of experience and training? Have you never taken a dance class but like to groove to your favorite song when it comes on the radio? Are you somewhere in between \u2014 perhaps you learned some choreography for a musical at school? We just want to know where you are right now. The Head of Dance at the New Studio on Broadway, which houses our music theatre program, will review and evaluate all candidates. In order for him to do this, we are providing a couple of different opportunities for candidates to be evaluated for dance. Freshperson music theatre candidates attending artistic reviews in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and transfer music theatre candidates in New York, will participate in a dance call, wherein they will be taught a combination incorporating elements of ballet and contemporary dance. Freshperson candidates attending artistic reviews in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, and Miami, and transfer candidates attending in Chicago and Los Angeles, along with those submitting digital artistic reviews, will be required to submit a dance video. Both forms of submission will provide the necessary information for a proper evaluation. Brief descriptions of each can be found below. Detailed guidelines for submitting your dance video can be found in the PDFs to the right. DANCE CALL (Freshpeople in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, and Transfers in New York Only) \u2028In small groups, candidates will be taught one combination that includes elements of ballet and some sort of contemporary dance (modern, jazz, Afro-centric, etc.). The purpose of the dance call is to assess your relationship to movement and your responsiveness to choreography.  \u2022 Please wear comfortable, fitted clothes that provide ease of movement  \u2022 You may wear ballet slippers, jazz shoes or no shoes (but no high-heeled character shoes) \u2022 You will have time to change into another outfit for your acting and singing evaluations \u2028DIGITAL DANCE SUBMISSION (Freshpeople in San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Transfers in Chicago and Los Angeles , and all Digitals ) If your audition city does not provide a dance call, you will be required to share with us a video of a one- to two-minute prepared dance solo to musical accompaniment. Choose your own music, which may include Broadway, hip-hop, classical or pop music, for example. Design your own choreography \u2014 by yourself or with help from a teacher or a dancer friend \u2014 and incorporate elements of dance that inspire you, like ballet, jazz, folk dance, tap or hip-hop. If you can think of it, you can use it. Include anything that showcases your use of the body as a creative instrument, demonstrating full body expressiveness and love of movement. The video must be created specifically for this artistic review. A clip from a previous performance is not acceptable. Please follow the more specific guidelines for submitting your dance video in the PDFs to the right.  Dance video deadlines apply only to candidates with in-person artistic reviews in cities which did not provide a dance call. Digital submission candidates have an earlier deadline for all five of their videos to be uploaded.

Our curriculum is designed for the serious young musician who is seeking a program that fully integrates the study of voice with the study of acting. We are committed to the traditions of classically-based vocal training while at the same time allowing students to explore the demanding repertoire that is expected of professional singers in today's ever-expanding world of music theatre performance.    In addition to voice, acting and dance, as well as courses in music theatre repertoire and history, the core of our program's music theatre specialization training takes place through an intensive series of music theatre workshops. These workshops explore such critical areas as movement, speech, diction, song study, scene study, audition skills, and business skills - the essential \"tools of the trade\" that a young artist needs in order to pursue a professional career.    In addition to the work in classrooms and studios, the program offers performance opportunities in fully-staged productions under the guidance of professional directors, choreographers, conductors, musical directors, and designers. Our guest artists and faculty are drawn from New York's vibrant community of professional artists who count Broadway, off-Broadway, regional theatre and national tours among their credits.    Students specializing in Music Theatre make their New York \"debut\" in their final semester as they are presented to New York's agents, casting directors, directors, and producers in their graduation showcase - a revue designed to feature the work of each student and help them make their first professional contacts in the industry.    The Department's acclaimed programs of study in Music Business (B.M., M.A.), Music Technology (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Jazz (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), Music Composition (B.M., M.M., Ph.D.), and Music Education (B.M., M.A., Ph.D.) provide a rich and valuable array of elective courses for music performance majors that prepare them for an ever-changing music industry and musical climate. Undergraduate and graduate students also benefit from the extraordinary opportunities available through the diverse offerings of a major university in the cultural capital of the world, New York City.
