Wagner Labor Archives at New York University form a unique, internationally-known center for scholarly research on Labor and the Left. The primary focus is the complex relationship between trade unionism and progressive politics and how this evolved over time. Archival, print, photograph, film, and oral history collections describe the history of the labor movement and how it related to the broader struggle for economic, social, and political change.    In 1977 the Robert F. Wagner Archives was established as a joint program of the New York City Central Labor Council and the Tamiment Library. The Wagner is the designated repository for the records of the Council's more than 200 member unions. Today the Library has an extraordinary research collection documenting the history of organized labor in New York and the workers who built the City.    Tamiment has one of the finest research collections in the country documenting the history of radical politics: socialism, communism, anarchism, utopian experiments, the cultural left, the New Left, and the struggle for civil rights and civil liberties. It is the repository for the Archives of Irish America, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, and a growing Asian American labor collection.

Collection Development Policy      Tamiment's archival collections, manuscripts, oral histories, photographs, films, videotapes, books, serials, and pamphlets document the history of labor, socialism, communism, anarchism, utopian experiments, the New Left, and the post-New Left as well as the social and cultural contexts in which these movements functioned.

Alternative Press Index A bibliographic database of journal, newspaper, and magazine articles from over 300 international alternative, radical, and left periodicals. Born of the New Left, the API was launched to provide access to the emerging theories and practices of radical social change. 1991 - present - online   Alternative Press Index Archive A bibliographic database of journal, newspaper, and magazine articles from over 700 international alternative, radical, and left periodicals that cover the period of 1969 through 1990. 1969 - 1990 - online   Index to Labor Periodicals . New York: Labor Research Department, Rand School of Social Science, 1926-1927; later Index to Labor Articles . New York: Labor Research Department, Rand School of Social Science, 1928-1953. This publication was started because the Reader's Guide and other indexes did not include union and socialist publications in their coverage. Initially appearing monthly, it indexed union, socialist, and business journals to provide a more balanced coverage of issues of importance to labor. In addition to the subject index, each issue also lists the journals indexed. With the decline of the school and the growth of individual union research departments, the index was discontinued. It still provides the only published index of union publications for the years 1941-1950. Also available as part of Socialist Collections in the Tamiment Library . Ann Arbor: UMI.   The Left Index . Complete guide to the diverse literature of the Left, with an emphasis on political, economic, social and culturally engaged scholarship inside and outside academia. A secondary emphasis is on significant but little-known sources of news and ideas. Other topics covered include the labor movement, ecology and environment, race and ethnicity, social and cultural theory, sociology, art and aesthetics, philosophy, history, education, law, and globalization. Historically significant early Left publications, such as The People (established in New York, 1891), and The Class Struggle (1931-1937), along with classic texts by Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Engels and others, written in the formative years of the Left, are also covered. Contains 120 drawers with author and subject cards indexing a variety of left publications. NYU researchers may access the online version at the above link.

Good  scholarship requires careful reading and critical analysis of  information.   Basic evaluation criteria for all sources, adapted from The Information-Literate Historian by Jenny L. Presnell (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), include the following:   Author Authority Who created the item? What is his or her affiliation?   Audience and Purpose Who is the intended audience? Why was the item created?   Accuracy and Completeness Is the evidence reliable? Are the important points covered?   Footnotes and Documentation Are the author's sources clearly identified with complete citations to allow you to find the original source yourself?     Perspective and Bias How do the author's bias and perspective inform the arguments and evidence presented?

Please note that some materials are held offsite and may take from two business days to a week to arrive for your use.   When searching finding aids, you'll get the best results if you are flexible with your search terms and try different keywords.   Put phrases in quotes (e.g., \"Transport Workers Union\").   Search on the LAST names of individiduals (e.g., \"Quill\") as well as their full names (e.g, \"Michael Quill\") to make sure you don't miss any collections that might be relevant.   Search using keywords (e.g., \"teacher\") as well as full organizational names (e.g., \"United Federation of Teachers\").   Click on \"Show Occurrences\" to see where your search term appears in the finding aid. If the collection looks promising, click on the title of the finding aid to read the entire document.   BROWSE the Collections List   The Tamiment Library's website has a page that lists all of the archival, oral history, nonprint, and printed ephemera collections in the library. The list is divided into four sections, each arranged in alphabetical order.   To streamline your browsing, try a \"Control F\" search to jump through the very long lists. Note that the Control F function is case-sensitive.   For example, start at the top of the page and search on the word \"Teacher\" (without quotes, but capitalized) to identify many individual archival collections related to teachers.   Click on the title of the collection to access the full finding aid.

Much of this visual material doesn't just supplement information in manuscript collections and papers--it can also provide evidence that is not available in written sources.   Photographs: Tamiment has close to one million photographs documenting a wide range of subjects including: union organizing, the workplace, the shop floor, the changing nature of work, strikes, rallies, demonstrations, progressive political campaigns, socialists, communists, anarchists, and members of other leftist organizations. They also depict working class resorts, summer camps, New York City street scenes and architecture. Photographs from the collection are often used in films, television programs, books, exhibits, and websites. They have also been displayed at both union gatherings and academic conferences.             Rose Schneiderman (1884-1972), posing at sewing machine, 1908.

Graphic Materials: The Library has a poster and broadside collection of more than 2,000 items, a number of original paintings and drawings, several thousand original pen and ink political cartoons, and more than 6,000 political buttons, as well as t-shirts, picket signs, banners, bumper stickers and other artifacts.   A selection of 1,500 of posters from Tamiment's graphics collection have been digitized and are on display in a ARTstor (available to NYU-affiliated researchers only). Selected posters are also featured in online exhibits via the Tamiment website. Some, but not all, of these digitized images may be reproduced.   Moving Images: Hundreds of video documentaries and feature films dealing with labor history and radical politics have been acquired through funding by the Jacob Blaufarb Endowment and the New York State Council on the Arts, as well as by direct donation. Videotapes cannot be borrowed but may be viewed at the Avery Fisher Center (Bobst Library, 2nd floor). A catalogue of these titles may be consulted at the Library. Among these works are two videos produced by Tamiment Library itself, drawing from two of its most important collections: Elizabeth Gurley Flynn: The Rebel Girl and They Were Not Silent: The Jewish Labor Movement and the Holocaust .   The Library also holds more than 40 hours of archival film footage (including out-takes and unedited footage) which are described in a finding aid to the collection. These materials may be screened for research purposes, and some of them may be licensed. More archival film footage is available for research purposes only (contact the Nonprint Archivist for information on these materials, which are described in an offline database). The collections also include several hundred hours of film that are part of the Library's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives and Communications Workers of America collections, a small portion of which is available for research, but not for licensing.

Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1983-. Given the diffusion of materials and the fact that the records of many defunct unions perished with the unions that created them, this is an extremely complete series. Entries are arranged alphabetically within twenty-two (loose) industry groups. Each entry is under the most recent official union name, and lists the union's affiliations, variant names, a brief chronology, and other basic information including referrals to related unions as well as mergers and successions (if material is available for the related unions). The entries are then divided into constitutions, proceedings, officers reports, and related documents. An index by union name and initials helps the user find the proper entry. The set, originally produced by another microfilm publisher, is now in microfiche as are the irregular supplements that bring it up to date. (Currently covering 1986-1990). This is a fundamental primary source for basic research. The proceedings are currently being cataloged in BobCat.

Barry produced a bibliography of sources in the Tamiment Library &amp; Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives related to U.S. women's labor history.   In the dozen years that have elapsed since the document was published on our website, much has changed in the library. Scores of new collections have been added to the library's holdings and previously unprocessed and uncataloged archival collections, monographs, and serials have been arranged and described in electronic finding aids and BobCat catalog records.   Reference sources from the 2000 bibliography have been absorbed into various new, updated, and expanded research guides , including this Labor Research Guide , our Serials Research Guide , and our Women's History Research Guide .   Sections of Barry's guide listing published books in Tamiment's collection on film and video, literature, scholarship, and historical studies remain useful starting points for researchers. See the links to sections of the guide in the box to the right, and see also the updated Published Primary Sources -- Women's Labor History in the Primary Sources section of this guide. For more recently published sources, researchers should search BobCat .   The information in Barry's 2000 guide pertaining to Tamiment's archival collections and vertical files is now completely out of date. Many archival collections have been arranged and described in electronic finding aids and we now have a finding aids search utility that was not available in 2000.
