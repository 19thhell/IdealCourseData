The program offers interdisciplinary instruction and research opportunities, with strengths in the following areas: the development of techniques for the statistical analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal studies, observational data, meta-analysis, survival data, and disease screening. Current studies in biostatistics also include the analysis of multivariate data produced by high-density microarrays (\u201cgene chips\u201d) in which the expression of tens of thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously. Applicants should have previous coursework in biology and statistics or mathematics. Normally, successful applicants will have a master\u2019s degree in a relevant field or at least two years of relevant research experience.   Click here for more information.      Epidemiology PhD Program   The PhD program in Epidemiology trains researchers to identify preventable causes of disease through the study of free-living human populations. Areas of specialization at NYU include cancer epidemiology, cardiovascular epidemiology, occupational epidemiology, clinical epidemiology, infectious disease epidemiology, including HIV/AIDS, and epidemiologic methods. The NYU Women's Health Study\u2014a long-term observational study of the relation between endogenous hormone levels, diet, and breast cancer\u2014has served as a rich data source for thesis projects in Epidemiology.

Master's Degree Programs     Master of Science in Clinical Investigation   Comparative Effectiveness Research track   The goal of the master\u2019s of science in Clinical Investigation, concentration in Comparative Effectiveness Research (MSCI-CER), is to increase the nation\u2019s supply of physician-investigators to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) focused on ways that health decisions affect our communities\u2014particularly those who are urban, underserved, and underrepresented. The comparative effectiveness research program is structured upon mentorship, coursework, and electives. This two-year, 34-credit training program will provide a substantive foundation in the knowledge, skills, and experience essential for a competitive research career. Click here for more information.   For applicants interested in a certificate program in Comparative Effectiveness Research, click here .   Click here for more information.     Translational Medicine track   The master\u2019s of science in Clinical Investigation, Translational Medicine track, consists of a core curriculum and mentored research experiences for clinician-scientists interested in applying scientific discoveries to the clinical setting. This degree is intended for physicians and other postdoctoral level clinicians interested in gaining the knowledge and research experience necessary for a career in population-based or translational research.   Click here for more information.      Global Master\u2019s of Public Health   NYU's strength in public health draws from the robust collaboration taking place across its renowned schools and colleges, fostering a truly interdisciplinary approach to addressing our most pressing global health challenges. The NYU master's of public health (MPH) curriculum offers an innovative and interdisciplinary approach to public health education. All students in the program embark in a rigorous study of public health that includes core public health competencies that serve as a foundation for further coursework in a student's chosen concentration. Students then pursue a concentration in one of three areas\u2014Community and International Health, Global Health Leadership, or Public Health Nutrition\u2014that allows for more in-depth study. Practice-based experiences facilitate application of knowledge and skills in real-world settings and general electives allow students to explore individual public health interests and acquire skills specific to their professional goals.   Click here for more information.      Master's of Bioethics   The master\u2019s of arts degree program in Bioethics: Life, Health, and Environment promotes a broad conception of bioethics that encompasses both medical and environmental ethics through conferences, workshops, public lectures, and graduate courses. Based in the Faculty of Arts and Science, the MA program draws on faculty affiliates in the schools of Medicine, Law, Education, and Public Service, among others. Students may choose to follow a health track or an environment track, but in both cases they receive a broad training in bioethics whose theories and applications encompass life in all its forms.

Other Degree Programs     Comparative Effectiveness Research Certification Program   The Comparative Effectiveness Research Certification Program provides education and career development in comparative effectiveness research training through mentorship and coursework. The year-long CER program will provide in-depth training, preparing scholars in comparative effectiveness career development. This advanced certificate consists of four required courses, totaling 12 credits. Four elective courses are also offered, at 3 credits each. This training program will provide a substantive foundation in the knowledge, skills and experience essential for a competitive research career.

The program offers interdisciplinary instruction and research opportunities, with strengths in the following areas: the development of techniques for the statistical analysis of clinical trials, longitudinal studies, observational data, meta-analysis, survival data, and disease screening. Current studies in biostatistics also include the analysis of multivariate data produced by high-density microarrays (\u201cgene chips\u201d) in which the expression of tens of thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously. Applicants should have previous coursework in biology and statistics or mathematics. Normally, successful applicants will have a master\u2019s degree in a relevant field or at least two years of relevant research experience.   Click here for more information.      Epidemiology PhD Program   The PhD program in Epidemiology trains researchers to identify preventable causes of disease through the study of free-living human populations. Areas of specialization at NYU include cancer epidemiology, cardiovascular epidemiology, occupational epidemiology, clinical epidemiology, infectious disease epidemiology, including HIV/AIDS, and epidemiologic methods. The NYU Women's Health Study\u2014a long-term observational study of the relation between endogenous hormone levels, diet, and breast cancer\u2014has served as a rich data source for thesis projects in Epidemiology.
