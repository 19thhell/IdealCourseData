Three Centuries of English and American Plays: a checklist. United States: 1714-1830 . New York: Hafner, 1963.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 B45 (also on microform)   Compiled as an index to the Readex Microprint edition of Three  Centuries of English and American Plays, this checklist can stand on  its own as a bibliography of 5,500 plays written between 1500 and 1830.  Entries are arranged by playwright and list the earliest edition known  and significant later editions for each play. Anonymous works can be  found under their titles. Entries include brief bibliographical  information and chronological period to which the play belongs. As  there is no title index readers must know the playwright&#39;s name when  looking for a specific play.         Dubois, William R. English  and American Stage Productions: An Annotated Checklist of Prompt Books  1800-1900 from the Nisbet-Snyder Drama Collection, Northern Illinois  University Libraries . Boston: G.K. Hall, 1973    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 D85   Prompt books and production editions of plays are valuable resources to  theatre historians because they often contain notes that illuminate  historical practices in staging and production. This work catalogs more  than 2,000 promptbooks and prompter&#39;s editions of plays that form a  collection held by the Northern Illinois Univ. Library. The plays were  produced on the American and English stage between 1775 and 1900, and  these books were used and annotated by directors and actors of those  productions. Entries are arranged alphabetically by playwright. Each  entry includes a physical description of the promptbook, a description  of its covers and any handwritten marks in the text, the date of the  earliest recorded New York or London production, and references to  secondary sources. Indexes provide additional access by play titles and  names of persons mentioned in the text.         Ellis, James ed. English Drama of the Nineteenth Century: an index and finding guide . New Canaan, CT: Readex Books, 1985.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 E42 1985 c.1   This single alphabetical listing by author and title of approximately  9,000 plays constitutes a substantial bibliography of  nineteenth-century English drama. Its primary purpose, however is as an  index and finding guide to the English plays issued through 1981 in the  Readex Microprint Collection English and American Drama of the  Nineteenth Century. It ranges far beyond the drama proper to include  children&#39;s plays, pantomime books of words, minstrel dialogues, solo  entertainments, opera libretti and vocal scores, and translations of  Continental dramatists from Aeschylus to Ibsen. The earlier English  dramatists, most particularly Shakespeare, are well represented in  collected series of the standard repertory and in acting editions  citing nineteenth-century casts and reflecting stage productions from  the time of Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble to that of Henry  Irving and Ellen Terry.         Hixon, Don L. and Hennessee, Don A. Nineteenth-Century American Drama: a finding guide . Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1977.    Bobst Ref1 PS632.H57   The Readex Corporation&#39;s English and American Drama of the 19th Century  microprint collection is a monumental work, containing thousands of  plays. It is located in the Microprint section of Bobst on the A Level.  Because of the difficulty of access, Hixon and Hennessee created an  index to part of the collection entitled &quot;American Plays, 1831-1900&quot;.  That section includes 4,500 plays. Authors and titles are arranged  alphabetically with all titles cross-referenced to authors. Because  Readex classified some plays under their adapters&#39; names instead of  their authors (for instance Shakespeare&#39;s works are listed under  various adaptors&#39; names), Hixon and Hennessee provide cross-references.  Appendices include one for series of plays, an ethnic/racial cast index  and a subject/form index. This last section locates children&#39;s plays,  minstrel plays, temperance plays, and so forth.         Litto, Fredric M. American Dissertations on the Drama and the Theatre: a bibliography . Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1969.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.L56   Litto uses a computer to compile this list of 4,565 dissertations  containing information about the theatrical arts. Although access is  provided by author, sufficient and keyword-in-context indexes, the  actual bibliography is arranged by a computer-generated reference mode.  Each entry lists the author and title of the dissertation along with  university and department names, degree granted, and date. Since this  work stops at 1965, one must use Dissertation Abstracts International  and the lists published annually in Theatre Journal (formerly  Educational Theatre Journal) to find more recent theses.         Pence, James Harry. The Magazine and the Drama: An index . (Theatre and Drama Series, 12) New York: Burt Franklin, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 P43 1970   An early attempt to index theatre articles in the periodical  literature, Pence&#39;s work locates articles about &quot;acted drama&quot; in 166  nineteenth-century magazines. These include Blackwood&#39;s, Godey&#39;s,  Lippincott&#39;s, McClure&#39;s, and the Spectator as well as other lesser  known titles. Although Pence does not state the years he has indexed  they appear to be from around 1872 to 1896. Subjects and authors appear  in one alphabet, and citations list periodical, volume, beginning page,  and (sometimes) date. The most reliable indexing is by personal name,  but one can find information on topics such as &quot;voice, culture of&quot; and  &quot;German stage.&quot; The usefulness of this volume depends in part on the  availability of nineteenth-century periodicals.         Stratman, Carl Joseph. American Theatrical Periodicals, 1789-1967 . Durham, NC Duke Univ. Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z6935.S75   Stratman has listed in chronological order all known theatrical  periodicals published in the United States to 1967. Although he found  685 titles, he warned that this first effort was likely incomplete.  Entries list bibliographic citations and holdings in several American  libraries. Using the index, readers can locate periodical titles,  editors, cities of publication, organizations sponsoring periodicals  and some keywords-in-the-title terms such as &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;dance,&quot; or  &quot;repertory.&quot; Stratman explains the use of the bibliography and index in  a clearly written introduction. Although now in need of an update, this  work will help those looking for older periodicals.                     Encyclopedias, Dictionaries and Histories          Brockett. Oscar G.

Bryan, George B. Stage Deaths: A Biographical Guide to International Theatrical Obituaries, 1850 to 1900 . Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1991.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.S76 1991 vol. 1 &amp; 2   A useful guide to obituaries and biographies of both famous and obscure  &quot;theatrical artists&quot;. He includes thousands of actors, dancers, circus  performers, film stars and theatre historians in two volumes of  alphabetically arranged entries. Entries cite obituaries in nine  newspapers, including the New York times and The times (London) as well  as book-length biographies and autobiographies. Because date and place  of death are given, readers can check local newspapers for additional  death notices. This set compliments the Variety obituaries (begins at  1905) well because it extends further back in time and because it cites  additional sources.         Hartnoll, Phylis. The Oxford Companion to the Theatre . 4th ed. New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2035.H3 1983   Offers concise, authoritative essays on all forms of theater, from  street performance to legitimate stage, from ancient Greece to the  present.

New York: McGraw Hill, 1984.    Bobst Ref1 PN1625.M3 1984 vol. 1-5   A truly wonderful encyclopedia comprehensive in scope. The 2nd ed.  expands both the text and pictorial content. All articles were written,  revised or updated by contributors who are active in the academic or  practical theatre world. Coverage on dramatists comprises five  sections; biographical outlining the highlights of a dramatists life,  analytical assessing creative achievements, synopses of major plays and  a play list.         Ireland, Joseph N. Records of the New York Stage from 1750 to 1860 . New York: B. Blom, 1966. [reprint of 1866 ed.]    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 I7 1966 vol. 1 &amp; 2   An ancestor to Odell&#39;s Annals of the New York Stage.  Ireland discusses performances in various New York theaters up to the Civil War.  Written in a narrative style, each chapter contains cast lists for plays produced during a particular year.  Ireland comments on various actors and actresses and provides some death notices.  A general index appears at the end of the second volume.  Use this work to supplement Odell.        Merserve, Walter J. An Outline History of American Drama . 2nd ed. New York: Feedback Theatrebooks &amp; Prospero Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PS332.M4 1994   Focuses on American plays and playwrights from the Colonial period to  present day. Topics discussed in terms of historical development, the  achievements of particular dramatists, and the contribution of  particular plays. Each chapter relates the progress of dramatic  criticism and the achievements of the theatre to a developing American  drama.         Mullin, Donald. Victorian  Actors and Actresses in Review: a Dictionary of Contemporary Views of  Representative British and American Actors and Actresses, 1837-1901 . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2597.V5 1983   Mullin has collected excerpts of Victorian criticism of 234 actors and  actresses of the period. So that the reader can consider the leading  players in relation to their supporting actors, Mullin includes reviews  of both stars and unknowns. For both he selects criticism of the actors  abilities in general and criticism of their performance of specific  roles. Critics quoted include George Bernard Shaw, Otis Skinner, and  William Winter, the &quot;doyen of New York theatre critics.&quot; Entries are  arranged alphabetically and include the actor&#39;s dates and nationality.  Excerpts are arranged chronologically. Full bibliographic information  for each citation in the bibliography is included. A subject index  completes the volume.         Odell, George C.D. Annals of the New York Stage, Before 1789-1894 . New York: AMS Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 04 1970 vol. 1-15   This history of the New York Stage relies on newspaper articles and other primary source materials.  The definitive history of early New York Theatre.        Slide Anthony. Encyclopedia of Vaudeville . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PN1968.U5 S37 1994   Focusing on personalities, including performers, creative talents, and  administrators, but also including entries on theaters, genres, etc.,  this is the first comprehensive encyclopedia on Vaudeville. Each entry,  when appropriate, includes a very brief bibliography. A guide to  Vaudeville research resources available in libraries is also included.         Wilmeth, Don B. and Miller, Tice L. Cambridge Guide to American Theatre . Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993.    Bobst Ref1 PN2220.C35 1993   This Cambridge work rivals the Oxford Companion the American Theatre in  its ability to provide short, factual answers to questions about the  world of American theatre. Eighty writers, including many of the  best-known theatre historians, inform readers about all subjects  related to the Theatre and to vaudeville, burlesque, the circus, magic,  and film festivals. Cambridge is more inclusive than Oxford whose scope  includes only legitimate theatre. Cambridge also does a better job with  the histories of major American cities such as Baltimore and  Philadelphia. Oxford, however, provides many more entries for  individual plays and persons. Cambridge includes a bibliography written  by Wilmeth and a introductory historical survey. At the moment,  Cambridge is more up-to-date than Oxford, but that advantage will  alternate as additional editions are issued.         Young, William C. Famous American Playhouses in the series Documents of American Theater History . Chicago: American Library Association, 1973.    Bobst Ref1 NA6830.Y68 vol. 1 &amp; 2   Vol. 1 covers theatre buildings from 1716-1899, Vol. 2 from 1900-1971.  In addition to brief overview of period each volume contain source  material from magazines and newspapers plus illustrations and  photographs.         Young, William C. Famous Actors and Actresses on the American Stage in the series Documents of American Theater History . New York: R.R. Bowker, 1975.    Bobst Ref1 PN2285.Y6 1975b vol. 1 &amp; 2   Presents information about 225 American actors, mostly from the  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He uses excerpts from articles,  interviews, and reviews published at the time the actor was working to  present both the actor&#39;s views on the profession and the critical  reception of his or her work. Chapters are arranged alphabetically by  name and excerpts are presented with citations at the end of each  chapter. The book is useful only as a beginning point. Young includes a  general index and a chronological index as well as a bibliography at  the end of the volume.

Three Centuries of English and American Plays: a checklist. United States: 1714-1830 . New York: Hafner, 1963.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 B45 (also on microform)   Compiled as an index to the Readex Microprint edition of Three  Centuries of English and American Plays, this checklist can stand on  its own as a bibliography of 5,500 plays written between 1500 and 1830.  Entries are arranged by playwright and list the earliest edition known  and significant later editions for each play. Anonymous works can be  found under their titles. Entries include brief bibliographical  information and chronological period to which the play belongs. As  there is no title index readers must know the playwright&#39;s name when  looking for a specific play.         Dubois, William R. English  and American Stage Productions: An Annotated Checklist of Prompt Books  1800-1900 from the Nisbet-Snyder Drama Collection, Northern Illinois  University Libraries . Boston: G.K. Hall, 1973    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 D85   Prompt books and production editions of plays are valuable resources to  theatre historians because they often contain notes that illuminate  historical practices in staging and production. This work catalogs more  than 2,000 promptbooks and prompter&#39;s editions of plays that form a  collection held by the Northern Illinois Univ. Library. The plays were  produced on the American and English stage between 1775 and 1900, and  these books were used and annotated by directors and actors of those  productions. Entries are arranged alphabetically by playwright. Each  entry includes a physical description of the promptbook, a description  of its covers and any handwritten marks in the text, the date of the  earliest recorded New York or London production, and references to  secondary sources. Indexes provide additional access by play titles and  names of persons mentioned in the text.         Ellis, James ed. English Drama of the Nineteenth Century: an index and finding guide . New Canaan, CT: Readex Books, 1985.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 E42 1985 c.1   This single alphabetical listing by author and title of approximately  9,000 plays constitutes a substantial bibliography of  nineteenth-century English drama. Its primary purpose, however is as an  index and finding guide to the English plays issued through 1981 in the  Readex Microprint Collection English and American Drama of the  Nineteenth Century. It ranges far beyond the drama proper to include  children&#39;s plays, pantomime books of words, minstrel dialogues, solo  entertainments, opera libretti and vocal scores, and translations of  Continental dramatists from Aeschylus to Ibsen. The earlier English  dramatists, most particularly Shakespeare, are well represented in  collected series of the standard repertory and in acting editions  citing nineteenth-century casts and reflecting stage productions from  the time of Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble to that of Henry  Irving and Ellen Terry.         Hixon, Don L. and Hennessee, Don A. Nineteenth-Century American Drama: a finding guide . Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1977.    Bobst Ref1 PS632.H57   The Readex Corporation&#39;s English and American Drama of the 19th Century  microprint collection is a monumental work, containing thousands of  plays. It is located in the Microprint section of Bobst on the A Level.  Because of the difficulty of access, Hixon and Hennessee created an  index to part of the collection entitled &quot;American Plays, 1831-1900&quot;.  That section includes 4,500 plays. Authors and titles are arranged  alphabetically with all titles cross-referenced to authors. Because  Readex classified some plays under their adapters&#39; names instead of  their authors (for instance Shakespeare&#39;s works are listed under  various adaptors&#39; names), Hixon and Hennessee provide cross-references.  Appendices include one for series of plays, an ethnic/racial cast index  and a subject/form index. This last section locates children&#39;s plays,  minstrel plays, temperance plays, and so forth.         Litto, Fredric M. American Dissertations on the Drama and the Theatre: a bibliography . Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1969.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.L56   Litto uses a computer to compile this list of 4,565 dissertations  containing information about the theatrical arts. Although access is  provided by author, sufficient and keyword-in-context indexes, the  actual bibliography is arranged by a computer-generated reference mode.  Each entry lists the author and title of the dissertation along with  university and department names, degree granted, and date. Since this  work stops at 1965, one must use Dissertation Abstracts International  and the lists published annually in Theatre Journal (formerly  Educational Theatre Journal) to find more recent theses.         Pence, James Harry. The Magazine and the Drama: An index . (Theatre and Drama Series, 12) New York: Burt Franklin, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 P43 1970   An early attempt to index theatre articles in the periodical  literature, Pence&#39;s work locates articles about &quot;acted drama&quot; in 166  nineteenth-century magazines. These include Blackwood&#39;s, Godey&#39;s,  Lippincott&#39;s, McClure&#39;s, and the Spectator as well as other lesser  known titles. Although Pence does not state the years he has indexed  they appear to be from around 1872 to 1896. Subjects and authors appear  in one alphabet, and citations list periodical, volume, beginning page,  and (sometimes) date. The most reliable indexing is by personal name,  but one can find information on topics such as &quot;voice, culture of&quot; and  &quot;German stage.&quot; The usefulness of this volume depends in part on the  availability of nineteenth-century periodicals.         Stratman, Carl Joseph. American Theatrical Periodicals, 1789-1967 . Durham, NC Duke Univ. Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z6935.S75   Stratman has listed in chronological order all known theatrical  periodicals published in the United States to 1967. Although he found  685 titles, he warned that this first effort was likely incomplete.  Entries list bibliographic citations and holdings in several American  libraries. Using the index, readers can locate periodical titles,  editors, cities of publication, organizations sponsoring periodicals  and some keywords-in-the-title terms such as &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;dance,&quot; or  &quot;repertory.&quot; Stratman explains the use of the bibliography and index in  a clearly written introduction. Although now in need of an update, this  work will help those looking for older periodicals.                     Encyclopedias, Dictionaries and Histories          Brockett. Oscar G.

Bryan, George B. Stage Deaths: A Biographical Guide to International Theatrical Obituaries, 1850 to 1900 . Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1991.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.S76 1991 vol. 1 &amp; 2   A useful guide to obituaries and biographies of both famous and obscure  &quot;theatrical artists&quot;. He includes thousands of actors, dancers, circus  performers, film stars and theatre historians in two volumes of  alphabetically arranged entries. Entries cite obituaries in nine  newspapers, including the New York times and The times (London) as well  as book-length biographies and autobiographies. Because date and place  of death are given, readers can check local newspapers for additional  death notices. This set compliments the Variety obituaries (begins at  1905) well because it extends further back in time and because it cites  additional sources.         Hartnoll, Phylis. The Oxford Companion to the Theatre . 4th ed. New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2035.H3 1983   Offers concise, authoritative essays on all forms of theater, from  street performance to legitimate stage, from ancient Greece to the  present.

New York: McGraw Hill, 1984.    Bobst Ref1 PN1625.M3 1984 vol. 1-5   A truly wonderful encyclopedia comprehensive in scope. The 2nd ed.  expands both the text and pictorial content. All articles were written,  revised or updated by contributors who are active in the academic or  practical theatre world. Coverage on dramatists comprises five  sections; biographical outlining the highlights of a dramatists life,  analytical assessing creative achievements, synopses of major plays and  a play list.         Ireland, Joseph N. Records of the New York Stage from 1750 to 1860 . New York: B. Blom, 1966. [reprint of 1866 ed.]    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 I7 1966 vol. 1 &amp; 2   An ancestor to Odell&#39;s Annals of the New York Stage.  Ireland discusses performances in various New York theaters up to the Civil War.  Written in a narrative style, each chapter contains cast lists for plays produced during a particular year.  Ireland comments on various actors and actresses and provides some death notices.  A general index appears at the end of the second volume.  Use this work to supplement Odell.        Merserve, Walter J. An Outline History of American Drama . 2nd ed. New York: Feedback Theatrebooks &amp; Prospero Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PS332.M4 1994   Focuses on American plays and playwrights from the Colonial period to  present day. Topics discussed in terms of historical development, the  achievements of particular dramatists, and the contribution of  particular plays. Each chapter relates the progress of dramatic  criticism and the achievements of the theatre to a developing American  drama.         Mullin, Donald. Victorian  Actors and Actresses in Review: a Dictionary of Contemporary Views of  Representative British and American Actors and Actresses, 1837-1901 . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2597.V5 1983   Mullin has collected excerpts of Victorian criticism of 234 actors and  actresses of the period. So that the reader can consider the leading  players in relation to their supporting actors, Mullin includes reviews  of both stars and unknowns. For both he selects criticism of the actors  abilities in general and criticism of their performance of specific  roles. Critics quoted include George Bernard Shaw, Otis Skinner, and  William Winter, the &quot;doyen of New York theatre critics.&quot; Entries are  arranged alphabetically and include the actor&#39;s dates and nationality.  Excerpts are arranged chronologically. Full bibliographic information  for each citation in the bibliography is included. A subject index  completes the volume.         Odell, George C.D. Annals of the New York Stage, Before 1789-1894 . New York: AMS Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 04 1970 vol. 1-15   This history of the New York Stage relies on newspaper articles and other primary source materials.  The definitive history of early New York Theatre.        Slide Anthony. Encyclopedia of Vaudeville . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PN1968.U5 S37 1994   Focusing on personalities, including performers, creative talents, and  administrators, but also including entries on theaters, genres, etc.,  this is the first comprehensive encyclopedia on Vaudeville. Each entry,  when appropriate, includes a very brief bibliography. A guide to  Vaudeville research resources available in libraries is also included.         Wilmeth, Don B. and Miller, Tice L. Cambridge Guide to American Theatre . Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993.    Bobst Ref1 PN2220.C35 1993   This Cambridge work rivals the Oxford Companion the American Theatre in  its ability to provide short, factual answers to questions about the  world of American theatre. Eighty writers, including many of the  best-known theatre historians, inform readers about all subjects  related to the Theatre and to vaudeville, burlesque, the circus, magic,  and film festivals. Cambridge is more inclusive than Oxford whose scope  includes only legitimate theatre. Cambridge also does a better job with  the histories of major American cities such as Baltimore and  Philadelphia. Oxford, however, provides many more entries for  individual plays and persons. Cambridge includes a bibliography written  by Wilmeth and a introductory historical survey. At the moment,  Cambridge is more up-to-date than Oxford, but that advantage will  alternate as additional editions are issued.         Young, William C. Famous American Playhouses in the series Documents of American Theater History . Chicago: American Library Association, 1973.    Bobst Ref1 NA6830.Y68 vol. 1 &amp; 2   Vol. 1 covers theatre buildings from 1716-1899, Vol. 2 from 1900-1971.  In addition to brief overview of period each volume contain source  material from magazines and newspapers plus illustrations and  photographs.         Young, William C. Famous Actors and Actresses on the American Stage in the series Documents of American Theater History . New York: R.R. Bowker, 1975.    Bobst Ref1 PN2285.Y6 1975b vol. 1 &amp; 2   Presents information about 225 American actors, mostly from the  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He uses excerpts from articles,  interviews, and reviews published at the time the actor was working to  present both the actor&#39;s views on the profession and the critical  reception of his or her work. Chapters are arranged alphabetically by  name and excerpts are presented with citations at the end of each  chapter. The book is useful only as a beginning point. Young includes a  general index and a chronological index as well as a bibliography at  the end of the volume.

Three Centuries of English and American Plays: a checklist. United States: 1714-1830 . New York: Hafner, 1963.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 B45 (also on microform)   Compiled as an index to the Readex Microprint edition of Three  Centuries of English and American Plays, this checklist can stand on  its own as a bibliography of 5,500 plays written between 1500 and 1830.  Entries are arranged by playwright and list the earliest edition known  and significant later editions for each play. Anonymous works can be  found under their titles. Entries include brief bibliographical  information and chronological period to which the play belongs. As  there is no title index readers must know the playwright&#39;s name when  looking for a specific play.         Dubois, William R. English  and American Stage Productions: An Annotated Checklist of Prompt Books  1800-1900 from the Nisbet-Snyder Drama Collection, Northern Illinois  University Libraries . Boston: G.K. Hall, 1973    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 D85   Prompt books and production editions of plays are valuable resources to  theatre historians because they often contain notes that illuminate  historical practices in staging and production. This work catalogs more  than 2,000 promptbooks and prompter&#39;s editions of plays that form a  collection held by the Northern Illinois Univ. Library. The plays were  produced on the American and English stage between 1775 and 1900, and  these books were used and annotated by directors and actors of those  productions. Entries are arranged alphabetically by playwright. Each  entry includes a physical description of the promptbook, a description  of its covers and any handwritten marks in the text, the date of the  earliest recorded New York or London production, and references to  secondary sources. Indexes provide additional access by play titles and  names of persons mentioned in the text.         Ellis, James ed. English Drama of the Nineteenth Century: an index and finding guide . New Canaan, CT: Readex Books, 1985.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 E42 1985 c.1   This single alphabetical listing by author and title of approximately  9,000 plays constitutes a substantial bibliography of  nineteenth-century English drama. Its primary purpose, however is as an  index and finding guide to the English plays issued through 1981 in the  Readex Microprint Collection English and American Drama of the  Nineteenth Century. It ranges far beyond the drama proper to include  children&#39;s plays, pantomime books of words, minstrel dialogues, solo  entertainments, opera libretti and vocal scores, and translations of  Continental dramatists from Aeschylus to Ibsen. The earlier English  dramatists, most particularly Shakespeare, are well represented in  collected series of the standard repertory and in acting editions  citing nineteenth-century casts and reflecting stage productions from  the time of Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble to that of Henry  Irving and Ellen Terry.         Hixon, Don L. and Hennessee, Don A. Nineteenth-Century American Drama: a finding guide . Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1977.    Bobst Ref1 PS632.H57   The Readex Corporation&#39;s English and American Drama of the 19th Century  microprint collection is a monumental work, containing thousands of  plays. It is located in the Microprint section of Bobst on the A Level.  Because of the difficulty of access, Hixon and Hennessee created an  index to part of the collection entitled &quot;American Plays, 1831-1900&quot;.  That section includes 4,500 plays. Authors and titles are arranged  alphabetically with all titles cross-referenced to authors. Because  Readex classified some plays under their adapters&#39; names instead of  their authors (for instance Shakespeare&#39;s works are listed under  various adaptors&#39; names), Hixon and Hennessee provide cross-references.  Appendices include one for series of plays, an ethnic/racial cast index  and a subject/form index. This last section locates children&#39;s plays,  minstrel plays, temperance plays, and so forth.         Litto, Fredric M. American Dissertations on the Drama and the Theatre: a bibliography . Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1969.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.L56   Litto uses a computer to compile this list of 4,565 dissertations  containing information about the theatrical arts. Although access is  provided by author, sufficient and keyword-in-context indexes, the  actual bibliography is arranged by a computer-generated reference mode.  Each entry lists the author and title of the dissertation along with  university and department names, degree granted, and date. Since this  work stops at 1965, one must use Dissertation Abstracts International  and the lists published annually in Theatre Journal (formerly  Educational Theatre Journal) to find more recent theses.         Pence, James Harry. The Magazine and the Drama: An index . (Theatre and Drama Series, 12) New York: Burt Franklin, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 P43 1970   An early attempt to index theatre articles in the periodical  literature, Pence&#39;s work locates articles about &quot;acted drama&quot; in 166  nineteenth-century magazines. These include Blackwood&#39;s, Godey&#39;s,  Lippincott&#39;s, McClure&#39;s, and the Spectator as well as other lesser  known titles. Although Pence does not state the years he has indexed  they appear to be from around 1872 to 1896. Subjects and authors appear  in one alphabet, and citations list periodical, volume, beginning page,  and (sometimes) date. The most reliable indexing is by personal name,  but one can find information on topics such as &quot;voice, culture of&quot; and  &quot;German stage.&quot; The usefulness of this volume depends in part on the  availability of nineteenth-century periodicals.         Stratman, Carl Joseph. American Theatrical Periodicals, 1789-1967 . Durham, NC Duke Univ. Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z6935.S75   Stratman has listed in chronological order all known theatrical  periodicals published in the United States to 1967. Although he found  685 titles, he warned that this first effort was likely incomplete.  Entries list bibliographic citations and holdings in several American  libraries. Using the index, readers can locate periodical titles,  editors, cities of publication, organizations sponsoring periodicals  and some keywords-in-the-title terms such as &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;dance,&quot; or  &quot;repertory.&quot; Stratman explains the use of the bibliography and index in  a clearly written introduction. Although now in need of an update, this  work will help those looking for older periodicals.                     Encyclopedias, Dictionaries and Histories          Brockett. Oscar G.

Bobst Ref1 Z5781.S76 1991 vol. 1 &amp; 2   A useful guide to obituaries and biographies of both famous and obscure  &quot;theatrical artists&quot;. He includes thousands of actors, dancers, circus  performers, film stars and theatre historians in two volumes of  alphabetically arranged entries. Entries cite obituaries in nine  newspapers, including the New York times and The times (London) as well  as book-length biographies and autobiographies. Because date and place  of death are given, readers can check local newspapers for additional  death notices. This set compliments the Variety obituaries (begins at  1905) well because it extends further back in time and because it cites  additional sources.         Hartnoll, Phylis.

All articles were written,  revised or updated by contributors who are active in the academic or  practical theatre world. Coverage on dramatists comprises five  sections; biographical outlining the highlights of a dramatists life,  analytical assessing creative achievements, synopses of major plays and  a play list.

Ireland discusses performances in various New York theaters up to the Civil War.  Written in a narrative style, each chapter contains cast lists for plays produced during a particular year.  Ireland comments on various actors and actresses and provides some death notices.  A general index appears at the end of the second volume.  Use this work to supplement Odell.        Merserve, Walter J. An Outline History of American Drama . 2nd ed. New York: Feedback Theatrebooks &amp; Prospero Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PS332.M4 1994   Focuses on American plays and playwrights from the Colonial period to  present day. Topics discussed in terms of historical development, the  achievements of particular dramatists, and the contribution of  particular plays. Each chapter relates the progress of dramatic  criticism and the achievements of the theatre to a developing American  drama.         Mullin, Donald. Victorian  Actors and Actresses in Review: a Dictionary of Contemporary Views of  Representative British and American Actors and Actresses, 1837-1901 . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2597.V5 1983   Mullin has collected excerpts of Victorian criticism of 234 actors and  actresses of the period. So that the reader can consider the leading  players in relation to their supporting actors, Mullin includes reviews  of both stars and unknowns. For both he selects criticism of the actors  abilities in general and criticism of their performance of specific  roles. Critics quoted include George Bernard Shaw, Otis Skinner, and  William Winter, the &quot;doyen of New York theatre critics.&quot; Entries are  arranged alphabetically and include the actor&#39;s dates and nationality.  Excerpts are arranged chronologically. Full bibliographic information  for each citation in the bibliography is included. A subject index  completes the volume.         Odell, George C.D.

Each entry,  when appropriate, includes a very brief bibliography. A guide to  Vaudeville research resources available in libraries is also included.         Wilmeth, Don B. and Miller, Tice L. Cambridge Guide to American Theatre . Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993.    Bobst Ref1 PN2220.C35 1993   This Cambridge work rivals the Oxford Companion the American Theatre in  its ability to provide short, factual answers to questions about the  world of American theatre. Eighty writers, including many of the  best-known theatre historians, inform readers about all subjects  related to the Theatre and to vaudeville, burlesque, the circus, magic,  and film festivals. Cambridge is more inclusive than Oxford whose scope  includes only legitimate theatre. Cambridge also does a better job with  the histories of major American cities such as Baltimore and  Philadelphia. Oxford, however, provides many more entries for  individual plays and persons. Cambridge includes a bibliography written  by Wilmeth and a introductory historical survey. At the moment,  Cambridge is more up-to-date than Oxford, but that advantage will  alternate as additional editions are issued.         Young, William C.
