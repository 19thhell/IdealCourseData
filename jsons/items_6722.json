On the shield, the god Hephaestos represented the whole earth, the sun and moon, the constellations, the Ocean that encircles the world, the cities of men, and their farms, festivals, and wars. Achilles\u2019 shield introduces questions about the ways in which the world and the cosmos were understood in the ancient world and the contexts that produced these understandings. How did different ancient sources represent the world and the relationship of the world to the heavenly bodies? What were the organizational principles and goals that governed these representations? As scientific knowledge expands, how do popular conceptions of the world adapt to this new information? And in the absence of maps, which have largely not survived from antiquity, how might other kinds of visual and textual evidence reveal how people thought about geographical relationships, as well as related relationships between centers and frontiers, peoples familiar and foreign, and the earth and heavens? This course investigates ancient scientific and mathematical theories on the extent and shape of the world alongside other kinds of representations\u2014poetic, political, religious, material, and visual.

Tendinopathy is an injury to the tendon. It can cause pain and swelling and makes it difficult to move. Tendinopathy may be: Tendonitis\u2014inflammation of the tendon Tendinosis\u2014tiny tears in the tendon with no significant inflammation The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscle to the heel bone. An achilles tendinopathy is pain in this tendon. Achilles Tendonitis                      Copyright \u00a9 Nucleus Medical Media, Inc.                                          Causes                      Tendinopathy is generally caused by overuse of a muscle-tendon unit. Over time, the strain on the tendon causes structural changes within the tendon. Overuse of the Achilles tendon can occur with activities such as: Increasing your speed or running long distances too quickly Suddenly adding strenuous hills or stair climbing to your exercise routine Doing too much too soon after taking time away from exercising A sudden or violent contraction of the calf muscles, such as during an all-out sprint Running too much Lack of flexibility of the calf muscles                                          Risk Factors                      Factors that may increase your risk of getting Achilles tendinopathy include: Improper or badly worn footwear Inflexibility of the calf muscles An improper training program\u2014such as increasing intensity too quickly Increased age\u2014normal wear and tear can make the tendon more likely to become injured                                          Symptoms                      Symptoms of tendinopathy may include: Tenderness\u2014usually just above the heel bone and often more noticeable in the morning Stiffness that gradually eases as the tendon is warmed-up Pain after activity that gradually worsens Pain along the tendon during and/or after running Swelling in the area of the Achilles tendon Pain at the back of the ankle                                          Diagnosis                      You will be asked about your symptoms and exercise habits. A physical exam will be done.   A diagnosis will be made based on the exam and history. Images of the bones and tendons may be taken. This can be done with:  X-rays Ultrasound MRI scan                                          Treatment                      Tendinopathy and the associated pain may take months to resolve. It can be frustrating, but it is important to follow through with the advised treatment.                      Rest and Ice                      Rest and ice are the first steps. Take a break from any activity that causes pain. Switch to activities that do not put stress on the tendon. Avoid uphill and irregular surfaces. Swimming is a good option. When the pain has gone, gradually increase your activity levels. Place ice or an ice pack on the area for 15-20 minutes at a time. This can help the first few days after the injury. It may also help after activity, if you have activity-related pain.                                          Foot and Ankle Support                      You may be advised to wear a shoe insert. It will place your foot in the correct position for walking and running. Taping your ankle during activity may also help. Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist before using this option. They can show you the proper way to wrap your foot.                                          Physical Therapy                      More severe or recurring injuries may need physical therapy. Therapy may include: Stretching Massage Ultrasound Strengthening exercises that focus on the calf muscles    Balance activities                                          Medications                      To help manage pain your doctor may advise:     Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), such as    ibuprofen or naproxen    Topical pain relievers that are applied to the skin Prescription pain relievers                                                              Prevention                      To decrease your chances of getting Achilles tendonitis: Wear appropriate footwear for your sport.     Do not use shoes beyond the advised duration. This will depend on:    How frequently you exercise The surface on which you exercise The conditions in which you exercise Gradually add hill work, stairs, speed, and distance to your routine. Stretch     and strengthen the calf muscles regularly.
