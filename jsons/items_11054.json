ACCRA                    Event information coming soon.               BERLIN                MONDAY-MONDAY   OCTOBER 27-NOVEMBER 3, 2014              WAS IST HEIMAT? - IMAGINE. ENCOUNTER. EXPLORE. ENGAGE. EXPERIENCE.     9:30 AM-1:30 PM     NYU Berlin Academic Center       NYU students traveling between various GNU sites and in and out of various host cultures are experts of cultural transitions. Together with their German professors, our Fall 2014 Berliners will work on video projects, short theater performances, and poems to illuminate how international mobility opens (or closes) spaces for them to explore a broader sense of belonging and the cultural and emotional conditions transforming their concept of home. Their contributions will be in German, the language of their host country.      Students will start with the word &quot;Heimat&quot;; a term commonly but inadequately translated as &quot;Home\u201d, \u201cHomeland&quot;, or &quot;Belonging&quot;. They will use the German words and expressions they have learned in class so far to chart the imaginary and emotional space made available by this new language. They will read and interpret poems, like Jean Am\u00e9ry\u2019s &quot;Wieviel Heimat braucht der Mensch?\u201d, introduce the places, tastes, and sounds that make them feel at home in Berlin, and share their individual responses to the following questions: Was ist Heimat? Warum ist Berlin Heimat? Warum nicht? Was vermisse ich? The various contributions will be combined in a short World Tour film and shared with the larger NYU community.             MONDAY   NOVEMBER 3, 2014            TEDxNYU BERLIN   8 PM TO 9:30 PM   NYU Berlin Academic Center       World Tour concludes with a TEDxNYU Berlin event on the following Monday, November 3rd. The TEDxNYU Berlin student initiative invites the NYU Berlin community to discuss and reflect together with several speakers on the various meanings Berlin has acquired for them, the complex idea of an authentic study abroad experience, and the power of stereotypes and preconceived notions for first and second impressions of a place. Participants will be invited to bring a dish of their choice that &quot;tastes like home&quot; and share its story with the community.

Argentina is a country that cannot be seen to its fullest in just one semester, therefore, what better way to see it than bringing the country to the students, staff, professors and NYU Alumni. In one day we hope to showcase the five regions that make up Argentina. Each of these regions are unique for their landscapes, weather, traditions, dances, music, food, etc.    We will begin the day with a typical Pampeano Breakfast. Throughout the day there will be plenty of activities for all to take part of using their World Tour passport in order to gain enough stamps to enter the Regions Basquet Contest at the end of the night.    There will be traditional in house sports\u00b4games, wine tasting, dessert making, tango and folklore dancing, trivia questions, get into character photo booth, food tasting of all the regions during lunch time, raffles, mingle with Alumni in the afternoon with a closing performance, catered dinner with items from various regions and the give aways of the Baskets. All proceeds from the raffles will go to Hospital Mu\u00f1iz in Parque Patricio, province of Buenos Aires, to help purchase much needed bottled water and toys for the holidays for children with HIV/AIDS.

They gather at Villa la Pietra, New York University\u00b4s exceptional site in Florence, to confront some of the most intractable issues of contemporary society through the creative interplay of ideas and perspectives\u201d.     The theme this semester is &quot;Black Italia&quot; and addresses &quot;How are Africans represented in the Italian imagination?&quot; and &quot;How is Italy changing under the pressure of immigration?&quot; In connection with this series of dialogues, the NYU Florence World Tour event is focusing on Italian culture linked with the influence of African migration, as well as how study away has expanded horizons and affected the global perspective of our students.     Included at the event will be:     \u2022 A professional cooking class provided at the event location for 30 students (on a sign up basis) where students will learn to cook easy Italian recipes which have been influenced by migration.   \u2022 A video projection of photos submitted by students for the World Tour celebrating their time so far in Italy including images of their travels in Italy and Europe so far this semester, everyday street life, \u2018modern art in a renaissance city\u2019, and multicultural Florence.   \u2022 A Spoken Word event, where students will be provided with a public forum to read out their works, read poetry, and quote selected extracts from their assignments. A group of students have been tasked with interviewing members of the immigrant communities in Florence, and have been invited to read the articles they have written based upon these interviews.   \u2022 A Senegalese band from the local community who will be introducing students to their music   \u2022 A selection of North African culinary specialties by a restaurant that caters for the local African community to introduce students to African cuisine.   \u2022 An Italian-themed photo booth to commemorate the occasion, with the NYU World Tour logo as part of the backdrop.   \u2022 A gelato tasting   \u2022 The event will be wrapped up with an Italian karaoke night where students will be encouraged to rehearse beforehand and join in with a series of classic Italian songs ranging from the ubiquitous \u2018Volare\u2019 to Dean Martin Classics like \u2018That\u2019s Amore\u2019 to celebrate the best of Italian culture through the medium of song.   \u2022 A movie screening of \u2018The Intouchables\u2019 a 2011 French comedy-drama, multiple award winning European box office hit about cross racial friendship and teamwork (trailer here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7g_OjLKeZ4 ) This will take place on Sunday evening at 8.00pm, which is when our weekly movie night takes place on campus.

In attendance at the wreath-laying ceremony and parade in Whitehall are members of the Royal Family, leading politicians, Commonwealth ambassadors, key figures from major national services and organisations, members of the Armed Forces and support organisations, and members of the public. Participation in this major public event is self-organised.             MONDAY   NOVEMBER 10, 2014            VISIT: TOWER OF LONDON   9:30 AM TO 11:30 AM   The Tower of London     We visit the Tower of London to see the finale of the huge \u2018Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Blood\u2019 art installation, created by ceramicist Paul Cummins with setting by stage designer Tom Piper. Spilling into the moat of the Tower since mid-summer is a great and growing tide of some 888,248 ceramic poppies, each symbolising a British military fatality during the First World War. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp.               FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 1 - WAR COMES TO BRITAIN     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105       (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the first episode of his landmark BBC TV series on how the First World War affected the lives of the British people, legendary broadcaster Jeremy Paxman tells the story of the dramatic early stages of the war, from stunned disbelief to the mass recruitment of volunteer soldiers. Fear of invasion grips the country. Boy Scouts guard bridges, and spies are suspected everywhere. For the first time, British civilians are fired on by enemy ships, and bombed from the air by planes and huge Zeppelin airships: a 105-year old eyewitness to the shelling of Hartlepool on the North-East coast of England describes how she thought that the Germans had landed. Total war has come to Britain.            CULTURE AT WAR: AN EVENING OF POETRY, DRAMA, FILM, &amp; MUSIC   6:30 PM TO 8:30 PM   NYU Tisch, Senate House, Room G37         An evening devised by Phillip Drummond (NYUL), Mary Jane Walsh and Ellis Jones (both NYU Tisch) reflecting upon the various cultural aspects of the Great War, involving poetry, drama, music and film. Alongside songs from the period, and extracts from Richard Attenborough\u2019s satirical 1969 film Oh! What a Lovely War, NYU Tisch students will present readings from the poetry of WWI \u2013 including famous works by Wilfred Owen, Rupert Brooke and Isaac Rosenberg \u2013 and will perform a scene from A.C. Sheriff\u2019s hugely popular play about life in the trenches, Journey\u2019s End.             TUESDAY   NOVEMBER 11, 2014            VISIT: TRAFALGAR SQUARE/BEDFORD SQUARE - ARMISTIC DAY: THE 11TH HOUR OF THE 11TH DAY OF THE 11TH MONTH     9:30 AM TO 11:30 AM   Trafalgar Square/Bedford Square          We visit Trafalgar Square in &amp; Central London to join the public commemoration of the Armistice which marked the end of World War One. This is traditionally marked by a two- minute silence which takes place across the nation at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp. We invite students and colleagues remaining in classes at NYUL to join us in the NYUL foyer promptly at 10.50am to go across to the Bedford Square Gardens to share the two-minute silence at 11.00am.                FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 2 - THE WAR MACHINE     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the second part of his major TV series Jeremy Paxman describes the crisis facing the country as it becomes clear it is fatally unprepared to fight a modern industrial war. Now the whole population is enlisted to turn the country into a war machine: women fill the factories to make bombs and bullets, men are forced to fight at the Front, conscientious objectors are threatened with the firing squad, and striking shipbuilders with jail. Even the beer is watered down on government orders. Britain is having to learn to do as it is told.             WEDNESDAY   NOVEMBER 12, 2014            VISIT: THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM     9:30 AM TO 12 PM   The First World War Galleries     We visit the Imperial War Museum in South London to tour the magnificent and newly- opened World War One Galleries, the nation\u2019s principal archival tribute to the conflict. The visit offers an extraordinarily immersive opportunity to follow the narrative of the war through engagement with its many images, sounds, and artefacts. The visit also includes an opportunity to visit Truth and Memory: The Art of the First World War , the accompanying exhibition of major paintings from the period. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp.            FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 3 - THE DARKEST HOUR     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105     (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the third episode of his TV series, Jeremy Paxman tells the story of how Britain edged close to defeat in the worst conflict it had ever known. Unearthing the wreck of a German U-boat in the River Medway, he describes Germany's attempt to starve the country into submission - could the Win the War Cookbook save the day? Hoarders are put on trial as newspapers expose how the rich dine out on lobsters in Mayfair. Fear of moral corruption prompts the government to police the nation's bedrooms. In cinemas, film of fighting in the trenches breaks all box office records - but will a shocked British public accept peace at any price?            EVENT: THE PITY OF WAR - WHY THE GREAT WAR WAS A GREAT MISTAKE, ACADEMIC FORUM &amp; FILM SCREENING     6:30 PM to 9 PM   NYUL Room 105          Eminent British historian Niall Ferguson (Harvard, Oxford and Stanford) published his controversial account of WWI, The Pity of War, in 1999. In this provocatively titled television symposium (BBC, 2014, 90 mins) he defends his revisionist thesis that Britain\u2019s entry into war was mistaken. His richly illustrated presentation is followed by a studio debate with leading fellow historians Sir Hew Strachan (Oxford), David Reynolds (Cambridge), Gary Sheffield (Wolverhampton), David Stevenson and Heather Jones (both London School of Economics). Following the screening, NYUL historians Professor Denis Judd and Professor Mike Newman (both Emeritus Professors of London Metropolitan University) will discuss the show in a session chaired by Event Curator Phillip Drummond. Wine, soft drinks and nibbles will be served during the interval.             THURSDAY   NOVEMBER 13, 2014            FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 4 - AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins)     In the concluding episode of the series, Jeremy Paxman describes how the country came to the very brink of defeat in the last year of the war. Grieving parents held s\u00e9ances to contact their dead sons, surgeons battled to rebuild the faces of the wounded, and a maverick MP tried to pin the blame for the crisis on a conspiracy of sexual deviants in government. And then, dramatically, the tide of battle turned, and exhausted Britons found themselves weeping for joy as the Armistice was signed. The nation began to count the cost of four years of war, revealing some surprising winners as well as losers.             FRIDAY   NOVEMBER 14, 2014            FILM SCREENING: WORLD WAR 1 - AMERICAN LEGACY     10 AM TO 12 PM   NYUL Room 105   (USA, 2006, 116 mins) Narrated by David Carradine, Mark Bussler\u2019s World War 1: American Legacy offers a wide- ranging examination of the impact of the Great War on American society. The film considers the contribution of soldier poets Alan Seeger and Joyce Kilmer, the vital work of US nurses, and the \u2018Harvard Volunteers\u2019, a group of America's privileged sons whose goal was to shame America into joining the world conflict by enlisting in the French Army. The emerging role of airplanes in combat is explained, with a focus on the famed Lafayette Espadrille battalion and the death of former President Teddy Roosevelt's aviator son Quentin over the fields of Germany. The film also pays tribute to famous fighting units such as the \u2018Harlem Hellfighters\u2019 of New York's 15th Regiment, an all-black volunteer group who fought racial prejudice and became the most decorated regiment of the War.              FILM SCREENING: WOMEN OF WORLD WAR ONE   1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins)      In a period when the social status of women was still a hotly contested issue, and when the Suffragette movement was still campaigning for votes for women, women\u2019s role in war was of vital significance at home and in the battle zone. Drawing on her 2013 book. Fighting on the Home Front: The Legacy of Women in World War One, distinguished war reporter Kate Adie examines the role of women in wartime. Innovations included the first women\u2019s police force, women\u2019s football, and female surgeons operating on male patients. Adie considers the major issue: were these changes in women\u2019s lives envisaged as something permanent, or merely as a temporary solution to the extraordinary conditions of a society at war?                  FILM SCREENING: THE WORLD'S WAR     2:30 PM TO 4:45 PM     NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 135 mins) Drawing on his 2014 book The World\u2019s War, historian and producer David Olusoga uncovers the hidden history of the large numbers of soldiers of colour who served in World War One. Drawn from the outposts of the British and French Empires in India and Africa, Black and Asian troops made the Western Front, for a while, perhaps the most multicultural place on earth, a true \u2018global city\u2019. The first soldier of the British Army to fire a shot in World War One was a black African; by the end of 1914 one third of the British sector of the Western Front was held by Indian soldiers; the efforts of Allied troops were supported by a workforce of as many as 140,000 Chinese labourers. This two-part programme, presented here with a short interval, examines the contribution made by Black and Asian participants in the conflict, and the ways in which they were carefully controlled and exploited by their colonial masters.                FILM SCREENING: ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT     5:15 PM TO 7:30 PM   NYUL Room 105   (USA, 1930, 136 mins)     Lewis Milestone\u2019s legendary anti-war film All Quiet on the Western Front (USA, 1930) is based on the celebrated novel Im Westen nichts Neues (Nothing New in the West) by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The book describes German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the front. First serialised in 1928 and then published in book form in early 1929, it sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first eighteen months in print. The novel and its sequel, The Road Back (1931) were among the books subsequently banned and burned - in Nazi Germany. In 1930, the book was adapted by Hollywood as an Oscar-winning film, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring Lew Ayres. Recently restored &amp;nbsp;to its original visual glory, this early sound film follows a group of German students who volunteer for action on the Western Front and leave behind the civilised spaces of everyday life in Germany for the hellish world of the trenches. Paul Baumer is a sensitive youth, but is persuaded to join up by a war-mongering professor advocating glory for the Fatherland. Paul and his friends train under Himmelstoss, a kindly postmaster turned brutal corporal, and then sent to the front lines to taste battle, blood and death.

Spanning South America, Africa and Asia, the tourist pathway known as the \u201cgringo trail\u201d has facilitated both life-altering adventures and the despoiling of many once virgin environments. The film follows stories along the trail to reveal the complex relationships between colliding cultures: host countries hungry for financial security and the tourists who provide it in their quest for authentic experiences.

ENGAGE. EXPERIENCE.     9:30 AM-1:30 PM     NYU Berlin Academic Center       NYU students traveling between various GNU sites and in and out of various host cultures are experts of cultural transitions. Together with their German professors, our Fall 2014 Berliners will work on video projects, short theater performances, and poems to illuminate how international mobility opens (or closes) spaces for them to explore a broader sense of belonging and the cultural and emotional conditions transforming their concept of home. Their contributions will be in German, the language of their host country.      Students will start with the word &quot;Heimat&quot;; a term commonly but inadequately translated as &quot;Home\u201d, \u201cHomeland&quot;, or &quot;Belonging&quot;. They will use the German words and expressions they have learned in class so far to chart the imaginary and emotional space made available by this new language. They will read and interpret poems, like Jean Am\u00e9ry\u2019s &quot;Wieviel Heimat braucht der Mensch?\u201d, introduce the places, tastes, and sounds that make them feel at home in Berlin, and share their individual responses to the following questions: Was ist Heimat? Warum ist Berlin Heimat? Warum nicht? Was vermisse ich? The various contributions will be combined in a short World Tour film and shared with the larger NYU community.             MONDAY   NOVEMBER 3, 2014            TEDxNYU BERLIN   8 PM TO 9:30 PM   NYU Berlin Academic Center       World Tour concludes with a TEDxNYU Berlin event on the following Monday, November 3rd. The TEDxNYU Berlin student initiative invites the NYU Berlin community to discuss and reflect together with several speakers on the various meanings Berlin has acquired for them, the complex idea of an authentic study abroad experience, and the power of stereotypes and preconceived notions for first and second impressions of a place. Participants will be invited to bring a dish of their choice that &quot;tastes like home&quot; and share its story with the community.

Argentina is a country that cannot be seen to its fullest in just one semester, therefore, what better way to see it than bringing the country to the students, staff, professors and NYU Alumni. In one day we hope to showcase the five regions that make up Argentina. Each of these regions are unique for their landscapes, weather, traditions, dances, music, food, etc.    We will begin the day with a typical Pampeano Breakfast. Throughout the day there will be plenty of activities for all to take part of using their World Tour passport in order to gain enough stamps to enter the Regions Basquet Contest at the end of the night.    There will be traditional in house sports\u00b4games, wine tasting, dessert making, tango and folklore dancing, trivia questions, get into character photo booth, food tasting of all the regions during lunch time, raffles, mingle with Alumni in the afternoon with a closing performance, catered dinner with items from various regions and the give aways of the Baskets. All proceeds from the raffles will go to Hospital Mu\u00f1iz in Parque Patricio, province of Buenos Aires, to help purchase much needed bottled water and toys for the holidays for children with HIV/AIDS.

MONDAY   NOVEMBER 10, 2014            VISIT: TOWER OF LONDON   9:30 AM TO 11:30 AM   The Tower of London     We visit the Tower of London to see the finale of the huge \u2018Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Blood\u2019 art installation, created by ceramicist Paul Cummins with setting by stage designer Tom Piper. Spilling into the moat of the Tower since mid-summer is a great and growing tide of some 888,248 ceramic poppies, each symbolising a British military fatality during the First World War. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp.               FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 1 - WAR COMES TO BRITAIN     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105       (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the first episode of his landmark BBC TV series on how the First World War affected the lives of the British people, legendary broadcaster Jeremy Paxman tells the story of the dramatic early stages of the war, from stunned disbelief to the mass recruitment of volunteer soldiers. Fear of invasion grips the country. Boy Scouts guard bridges, and spies are suspected everywhere. For the first time, British civilians are fired on by enemy ships, and bombed from the air by planes and huge Zeppelin airships: a 105-year old eyewitness to the shelling of Hartlepool on the North-East coast of England describes how she thought that the Germans had landed. Total war has come to Britain.            CULTURE AT WAR: AN EVENING OF POETRY, DRAMA, FILM, &amp; MUSIC   6:30 PM TO 8:30 PM   NYU Tisch, Senate House, Room G37         An evening devised by Phillip Drummond (NYUL), Mary Jane Walsh and Ellis Jones (both NYU Tisch) reflecting upon the various cultural aspects of the Great War, involving poetry, drama, music and film. Alongside songs from the period, and extracts from Richard Attenborough\u2019s satirical 1969 film Oh! What a Lovely War, NYU Tisch students will present readings from the poetry of WWI \u2013 including famous works by Wilfred Owen, Rupert Brooke and Isaac Rosenberg \u2013 and will perform a scene from A.C. Sheriff\u2019s hugely popular play about life in the trenches, Journey\u2019s End.             TUESDAY   NOVEMBER 11, 2014            VISIT: TRAFALGAR SQUARE/BEDFORD SQUARE - ARMISTIC DAY: THE 11TH HOUR OF THE 11TH DAY OF THE 11TH MONTH     9:30 AM TO 11:30 AM   Trafalgar Square/Bedford Square          We visit Trafalgar Square in &amp; Central London to join the public commemoration of the Armistice which marked the end of World War One. This is traditionally marked by a two- minute silence which takes place across the nation at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp. We invite students and colleagues remaining in classes at NYUL to join us in the NYUL foyer promptly at 10.50am to go across to the Bedford Square Gardens to share the two-minute silence at 11.00am.                FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 2 - THE WAR MACHINE     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the second part of his major TV series Jeremy Paxman describes the crisis facing the country as it becomes clear it is fatally unprepared to fight a modern industrial war. Now the whole population is enlisted to turn the country into a war machine: women fill the factories to make bombs and bullets, men are forced to fight at the Front, conscientious objectors are threatened with the firing squad, and striking shipbuilders with jail. Even the beer is watered down on government orders. Britain is having to learn to do as it is told.             WEDNESDAY   NOVEMBER 12, 2014            VISIT: THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM     9:30 AM TO 12 PM   The First World War Galleries     We visit the Imperial War Museum in South London to tour the magnificent and newly- opened World War One Galleries, the nation\u2019s principal archival tribute to the conflict. The visit offers an extraordinarily immersive opportunity to follow the narrative of the war through engagement with its many images, sounds, and artefacts. The visit also includes an opportunity to visit Truth and Memory: The Art of the First World War , the accompanying exhibition of major paintings from the period. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp.            FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 3 - THE DARKEST HOUR     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105     (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the third episode of his TV series, Jeremy Paxman tells the story of how Britain edged close to defeat in the worst conflict it had ever known. Unearthing the wreck of a German U-boat in the River Medway, he describes Germany's attempt to starve the country into submission - could the Win the War Cookbook save the day? Hoarders are put on trial as newspapers expose how the rich dine out on lobsters in Mayfair. Fear of moral corruption prompts the government to police the nation's bedrooms. In cinemas, film of fighting in the trenches breaks all box office records - but will a shocked British public accept peace at any price?            EVENT: THE PITY OF WAR - WHY THE GREAT WAR WAS A GREAT MISTAKE, ACADEMIC FORUM &amp; FILM SCREENING     6:30 PM to 9 PM   NYUL Room 105          Eminent British historian Niall Ferguson (Harvard, Oxford and Stanford) published his controversial account of WWI, The Pity of War, in 1999. In this provocatively titled television symposium (BBC, 2014, 90 mins) he defends his revisionist thesis that Britain\u2019s entry into war was mistaken. His richly illustrated presentation is followed by a studio debate with leading fellow historians Sir Hew Strachan (Oxford), David Reynolds (Cambridge), Gary Sheffield (Wolverhampton), David Stevenson and Heather Jones (both London School of Economics). Following the screening, NYUL historians Professor Denis Judd and Professor Mike Newman (both Emeritus Professors of London Metropolitan University) will discuss the show in a session chaired by Event Curator Phillip Drummond. Wine, soft drinks and nibbles will be served during the interval.             THURSDAY   NOVEMBER 13, 2014            FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 4 - AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins)     In the concluding episode of the series, Jeremy Paxman describes how the country came to the very brink of defeat in the last year of the war. Grieving parents held s\u00e9ances to contact their dead sons, surgeons battled to rebuild the faces of the wounded, and a maverick MP tried to pin the blame for the crisis on a conspiracy of sexual deviants in government. And then, dramatically, the tide of battle turned, and exhausted Britons found themselves weeping for joy as the Armistice was signed. The nation began to count the cost of four years of war, revealing some surprising winners as well as losers.             FRIDAY   NOVEMBER 14, 2014            FILM SCREENING: WORLD WAR 1 - AMERICAN LEGACY     10 AM TO 12 PM   NYUL Room 105   (USA, 2006, 116 mins) Narrated by David Carradine, Mark Bussler\u2019s World War 1: American Legacy offers a wide- ranging examination of the impact of the Great War on American society. The film considers the contribution of soldier poets Alan Seeger and Joyce Kilmer, the vital work of US nurses, and the \u2018Harvard Volunteers\u2019, a group of America's privileged sons whose goal was to shame America into joining the world conflict by enlisting in the French Army. The emerging role of airplanes in combat is explained, with a focus on the famed Lafayette Espadrille battalion and the death of former President Teddy Roosevelt's aviator son Quentin over the fields of Germany. The film also pays tribute to famous fighting units such as the \u2018Harlem Hellfighters\u2019 of New York's 15th Regiment, an all-black volunteer group who fought racial prejudice and became the most decorated regiment of the War.              FILM SCREENING: WOMEN OF WORLD WAR ONE   1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins)      In a period when the social status of women was still a hotly contested issue, and when the Suffragette movement was still campaigning for votes for women, women\u2019s role in war was of vital significance at home and in the battle zone. Drawing on her 2013 book. Fighting on the Home Front: The Legacy of Women in World War One, distinguished war reporter Kate Adie examines the role of women in wartime. Innovations included the first women\u2019s police force, women\u2019s football, and female surgeons operating on male patients. Adie considers the major issue: were these changes in women\u2019s lives envisaged as something permanent, or merely as a temporary solution to the extraordinary conditions of a society at war?                  FILM SCREENING: THE WORLD'S WAR     2:30 PM TO 4:45 PM     NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 135 mins) Drawing on his 2014 book The World\u2019s War, historian and producer David Olusoga uncovers the hidden history of the large numbers of soldiers of colour who served in World War One. Drawn from the outposts of the British and French Empires in India and Africa, Black and Asian troops made the Western Front, for a while, perhaps the most multicultural place on earth, a true \u2018global city\u2019. The first soldier of the British Army to fire a shot in World War One was a black African; by the end of 1914 one third of the British sector of the Western Front was held by Indian soldiers; the efforts of Allied troops were supported by a workforce of as many as 140,000 Chinese labourers. This two-part programme, presented here with a short interval, examines the contribution made by Black and Asian participants in the conflict, and the ways in which they were carefully controlled and exploited by their colonial masters.                FILM SCREENING: ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT     5:15 PM TO 7:30 PM   NYUL Room 105   (USA, 1930, 136 mins)     Lewis Milestone\u2019s legendary anti-war film All Quiet on the Western Front (USA, 1930) is based on the celebrated novel Im Westen nichts Neues (Nothing New in the West) by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The book describes German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the front. First serialised in 1928 and then published in book form in early 1929, it sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first eighteen months in print. The novel and its sequel, The Road Back (1931) were among the books subsequently banned and burned - in Nazi Germany. In 1930, the book was adapted by Hollywood as an Oscar-winning film, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring Lew Ayres. Recently restored &amp;nbsp;to its original visual glory, this early sound film follows a group of German students who volunteer for action on the Western Front and leave behind the civilised spaces of everyday life in Germany for the hellish world of the trenches. Paul Baumer is a sensitive youth, but is persuaded to join up by a war-mongering professor advocating glory for the Fatherland. Paul and his friends train under Himmelstoss, a kindly postmaster turned brutal corporal, and then sent to the front lines to taste battle, blood and death.

Spanning South America, Africa and Asia, the tourist pathway known as the \u201cgringo trail\u201d has facilitated both life-altering adventures and the despoiling of many once virgin environments. The film follows stories along the trail to reveal the complex relationships between colliding cultures: host countries hungry for financial security and the tourists who provide it in their quest for authentic experiences.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.

ENGAGE. EXPERIENCE.     9:30 AM-1:30 PM     NYU Berlin Academic Center       NYU students traveling between various GNU sites and in and out of various host cultures are experts of cultural transitions. Together with their German professors, our Fall 2014 Berliners will work on video projects, short theater performances, and poems to illuminate how international mobility opens (or closes) spaces for them to explore a broader sense of belonging and the cultural and emotional conditions transforming their concept of home. Their contributions will be in German, the language of their host country.      Students will start with the word &quot;Heimat&quot;; a term commonly but inadequately translated as &quot;Home\u201d, \u201cHomeland&quot;, or &quot;Belonging&quot;. They will use the German words and expressions they have learned in class so far to chart the imaginary and emotional space made available by this new language. They will read and interpret poems, like Jean Am\u00e9ry\u2019s &quot;Wieviel Heimat braucht der Mensch?\u201d, introduce the places, tastes, and sounds that make them feel at home in Berlin, and share their individual responses to the following questions: Was ist Heimat? Warum ist Berlin Heimat? Warum nicht? Was vermisse ich? The various contributions will be combined in a short World Tour film and shared with the larger NYU community.             MONDAY   NOVEMBER 3, 2014            TEDxNYU BERLIN   8 PM TO 9:30 PM   NYU Berlin Academic Center       World Tour concludes with a TEDxNYU Berlin event on the following Monday, November 3rd. The TEDxNYU Berlin student initiative invites the NYU Berlin community to discuss and reflect together with several speakers on the various meanings Berlin has acquired for them, the complex idea of an authentic study abroad experience, and the power of stereotypes and preconceived notions for first and second impressions of a place. Participants will be invited to bring a dish of their choice that &quot;tastes like home&quot; and share its story with the community.

Argentina is a country that cannot be seen to its fullest in just one semester, therefore, what better way to see it than bringing the country to the students, staff, professors and NYU Alumni. In one day we hope to showcase the five regions that make up Argentina. Each of these regions are unique for their landscapes, weather, traditions, dances, music, food, etc.    We will begin the day with a typical Pampeano Breakfast. Throughout the day there will be plenty of activities for all to take part of using their World Tour passport in order to gain enough stamps to enter the Regions Basquet Contest at the end of the night.    There will be traditional in house sports\u00b4games, wine tasting, dessert making, tango and folklore dancing, trivia questions, get into character photo booth, food tasting of all the regions during lunch time, raffles, mingle with Alumni in the afternoon with a closing performance, catered dinner with items from various regions and the give aways of the Baskets. All proceeds from the raffles will go to Hospital Mu\u00f1iz in Parque Patricio, province of Buenos Aires, to help purchase much needed bottled water and toys for the holidays for children with HIV/AIDS.

Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp.               FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 1 - WAR COMES TO BRITAIN     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105       (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the first episode of his landmark BBC TV series on how the First World War affected the lives of the British people, legendary broadcaster Jeremy Paxman tells the story of the dramatic early stages of the war, from stunned disbelief to the mass recruitment of volunteer soldiers. Fear of invasion grips the country. Boy Scouts guard bridges, and spies are suspected everywhere. For the first time, British civilians are fired on by enemy ships, and bombed from the air by planes and huge Zeppelin airships: a 105-year old eyewitness to the shelling of Hartlepool on the North-East coast of England describes how she thought that the Germans had landed. Total war has come to Britain.

What a Lovely War, NYU Tisch students will present readings from the poetry of WWI \u2013 including famous works by Wilfred Owen, Rupert Brooke and Isaac Rosenberg \u2013 and will perform a scene from A.C. Sheriff\u2019s hugely popular play about life in the trenches, Journey\u2019s End.

This is traditionally marked by a two- minute silence which takes place across the nation at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp. We invite students and colleagues remaining in classes at NYUL to join us in the NYUL foyer promptly at 10.50am to go across to the Bedford Square Gardens to share the two-minute silence at 11.00am.                FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 2 - THE WAR MACHINE     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the second part of his major TV series Jeremy Paxman describes the crisis facing the country as it becomes clear it is fatally unprepared to fight a modern industrial war. Now the whole population is enlisted to turn the country into a war machine: women fill the factories to make bombs and bullets, men are forced to fight at the Front, conscientious objectors are threatened with the firing squad, and striking shipbuilders with jail. Even the beer is watered down on government orders. Britain is having to learn to do as it is told.             WEDNESDAY   NOVEMBER 12, 2014            VISIT: THE IMPERIAL WAR MUSEUM     9:30 AM TO 12 PM   The First World War Galleries     We visit the Imperial War Museum in South London to tour the magnificent and newly- opened World War One Galleries, the nation\u2019s principal archival tribute to the conflict. The visit offers an extraordinarily immersive opportunity to follow the narrative of the war through engagement with its many images, sounds, and artefacts. The visit also includes an opportunity to visit Truth and Memory: The Art of the First World War , the accompanying exhibition of major paintings from the period. Departure from NYUL at 9.30am sharp.            FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 3 - THE DARKEST HOUR     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105     (BBC, 2014, 60 mins) In the third episode of his TV series, Jeremy Paxman tells the story of how Britain edged close to defeat in the worst conflict it had ever known. Unearthing the wreck of a German U-boat in the River Medway, he describes Germany's attempt to starve the country into submission - could the Win the War Cookbook save the day? Hoarders are put on trial as newspapers expose how the rich dine out on lobsters in Mayfair. Fear of moral corruption prompts the government to police the nation's bedrooms. In cinemas, film of fighting in the trenches breaks all box office records - but will a shocked British public accept peace at any price?            EVENT: THE PITY OF WAR - WHY THE GREAT WAR WAS A GREAT MISTAKE, ACADEMIC FORUM &amp; FILM SCREENING     6:30 PM to 9 PM   NYUL Room 105          Eminent British historian Niall Ferguson (Harvard, Oxford and Stanford) published his controversial account of WWI, The Pity of War, in 1999. In this provocatively titled television symposium (BBC, 2014, 90 mins) he defends his revisionist thesis that Britain\u2019s entry into war was mistaken. His richly illustrated presentation is followed by a studio debate with leading fellow historians Sir Hew Strachan (Oxford), David Reynolds (Cambridge), Gary Sheffield (Wolverhampton), David Stevenson and Heather Jones (both London School of Economics). Following the screening, NYUL historians Professor Denis Judd and Professor Mike Newman (both Emeritus Professors of London Metropolitan University) will discuss the show in a session chaired by Event Curator Phillip Drummond. Wine, soft drinks and nibbles will be served during the interval.             THURSDAY   NOVEMBER 13, 2014            FILM SCREENING: BRITAIN'S GREAT WAR 4 - AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR     1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins)     In the concluding episode of the series, Jeremy Paxman describes how the country came to the very brink of defeat in the last year of the war. Grieving parents held s\u00e9ances to contact their dead sons, surgeons battled to rebuild the faces of the wounded, and a maverick MP tried to pin the blame for the crisis on a conspiracy of sexual deviants in government. And then, dramatically, the tide of battle turned, and exhausted Britons found themselves weeping for joy as the Armistice was signed. The nation began to count the cost of four years of war, revealing some surprising winners as well as losers.             FRIDAY   NOVEMBER 14, 2014            FILM SCREENING: WORLD WAR 1 - AMERICAN LEGACY     10 AM TO 12 PM   NYUL Room 105   (USA, 2006, 116 mins) Narrated by David Carradine, Mark Bussler\u2019s World War 1: American Legacy offers a wide- ranging examination of the impact of the Great War on American society. The film considers the contribution of soldier poets Alan Seeger and Joyce Kilmer, the vital work of US nurses, and the \u2018Harvard Volunteers\u2019, a group of America's privileged sons whose goal was to shame America into joining the world conflict by enlisting in the French Army. The emerging role of airplanes in combat is explained, with a focus on the famed Lafayette Espadrille battalion and the death of former President Teddy Roosevelt's aviator son Quentin over the fields of Germany. The film also pays tribute to famous fighting units such as the \u2018Harlem Hellfighters\u2019 of New York's 15th Regiment, an all-black volunteer group who fought racial prejudice and became the most decorated regiment of the War.              FILM SCREENING: WOMEN OF WORLD WAR ONE   1 PM TO 2 PM   NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 60 mins)      In a period when the social status of women was still a hotly contested issue, and when the Suffragette movement was still campaigning for votes for women, women\u2019s role in war was of vital significance at home and in the battle zone. Drawing on her 2013 book. Fighting on the Home Front: The Legacy of Women in World War One, distinguished war reporter Kate Adie examines the role of women in wartime. Innovations included the first women\u2019s police force, women\u2019s football, and female surgeons operating on male patients. Adie considers the major issue: were these changes in women\u2019s lives envisaged as something permanent, or merely as a temporary solution to the extraordinary conditions of a society at war?                  FILM SCREENING: THE WORLD'S WAR     2:30 PM TO 4:45 PM     NYUL Room 105   (BBC, 2014, 135 mins) Drawing on his 2014 book The World\u2019s War, historian and producer David Olusoga uncovers the hidden history of the large numbers of soldiers of colour who served in World War One. Drawn from the outposts of the British and French Empires in India and Africa, Black and Asian troops made the Western Front, for a while, perhaps the most multicultural place on earth, a true \u2018global city\u2019. The first soldier of the British Army to fire a shot in World War One was a black African; by the end of 1914 one third of the British sector of the Western Front was held by Indian soldiers; the efforts of Allied troops were supported by a workforce of as many as 140,000 Chinese labourers. This two-part programme, presented here with a short interval, examines the contribution made by Black and Asian participants in the conflict, and the ways in which they were carefully controlled and exploited by their colonial masters.                FILM SCREENING: ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT     5:15 PM TO 7:30 PM   NYUL Room 105   (USA, 1930, 136 mins)     Lewis Milestone\u2019s legendary anti-war film All Quiet on the Western Front (USA, 1930) is based on the celebrated novel Im Westen nichts Neues (Nothing New in the West) by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of World War I. The book describes German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the front. First serialised in 1928 and then published in book form in early 1929, it sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first eighteen months in print. The novel and its sequel, The Road Back (1931) were among the books subsequently banned and burned - in Nazi Germany. In 1930, the book was adapted by Hollywood as an Oscar-winning film, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring Lew Ayres. Recently restored &amp;nbsp;to its original visual glory, this early sound film follows a group of German students who volunteer for action on the Western Front and leave behind the civilised spaces of everyday life in Germany for the hellish world of the trenches. Paul Baumer is a sensitive youth, but is persuaded to join up by a war-mongering professor advocating glory for the Fatherland. Paul and his friends train under Himmelstoss, a kindly postmaster turned brutal corporal, and then sent to the front lines to taste battle, blood and death.

Spanning South America, Africa and Asia, the tourist pathway known as the \u201cgringo trail\u201d has facilitated both life-altering adventures and the despoiling of many once virgin environments. The film follows stories along the trail to reveal the complex relationships between colliding cultures: host countries hungry for financial security and the tourists who provide it in their quest for authentic experiences.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.
