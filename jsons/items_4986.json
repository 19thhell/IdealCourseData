Medieval Technology and Everyday Life   MEDI-UA 3 Offered regularly. Gans. 2 points.   Gives a tour of the mills, factories, schools, travel technology, cathedral builders, miners, merchants, masons, weavers, and nobles of the Middle Ages. Examines the impact of new technology on the lives of both the rich and the ordinary; on men, women, and children; and on medieval beliefs and politics. Also looks at the start of the process that propelled Western Europe from a pastoral backwater to the dominant region of the globe. No background in medieval history or science/technology is needed for this course.    The Civilization and Culture of the Middle Ages   MEDI-UA 11 Identical to HIST-UA 11. Offered every year. Bedos-Rezak, Griffiths. 4 points.   Concentrates on the culture of medieval Europe, a world that produced castles and crusades, cathedrals and tapestries, mystery plays and epics, and plainsong and philosophy. Examines the richness and diversity of medieval creativity through lectures, class discussions, literature, slides, and museum visits.    Philosophy in the Middle Ages   MEDI-UA 60 Identical to PHIL-UA 25. Offered regularly. 4 points.   Study of major medieval philosophers, their issues, schools, and current philosophic interests. Includes, among others, Augustine, Anselm, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham.    The Culture and Literature of the Renaissance   MEDI-UA 311 Identical to FREN-UA 311.

Examines the richness and diversity of Renaissance creativity through lectures, class discussions, literature, and slides.    The Saints: Lore and Legend   MEDI-UA 365 Identical to FREN-UA 365. Offered periodically. Vitz. 2 points.   Focuses on the saint as a major figure in Western culture. Examines definitions of holiness and models of sanctity in the Old and New Testaments and in the early Christian church, then explores the important role played by saints in medieval culture and beyond. Topics considered include the theology of devotion to the saints and to the Virgin Mary in Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, determination of sainthood, and gender differences among saints. Uses literary, historical, artistic, and religious documents.    Don Quixote   MEDI-UA 371 Dopico-Black. 4 points.   A reading of Cervantes's Don Quixote that explores its privileged position as the first modern novel while also attending to the rich and complex historical context from which it emerged.    The Medieval and Renaissance Love Lyric   MEDI-UA 420 Offered periodically. 4 points.   The courtly love lyric, one of the most enduring genres of Western literature, portrayed love as an experience ranging from a degrading passion to an ennobling force, often crucial to poetic inspiration. The course traces the medieval love lyric from its beginnings in 11th-century Provencal through its developments in Latin, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Examines how the themes and conventions of this lyric are transformed in the Renaissance by such major love poets as Petrarch, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Donne. Medieval Misogyny MEDI-UA 488 4 points. Beginning with the biblical story of creation and moving through the powerful gendered tradition established by Saint Paul, this course will look at key texts of the Western Middle Ages (in modern English translation) in which men lay down the law, and occasionally, women talk back. Among other works we will take up the letters of Abelard and Heloise, the life of the enclosed Christina of Markyate, the fictive but larger than life Wife of Bath, and the imagined feminine utopia of Christine de Pizan.    Medieval Theatre   MEDI-UA 712 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Survey of medieval theatre in Europe: the plays and their contexts in the church, courts, and carnival. A study of the plays themselves, ranging from mystery plays to farces, and a look at techniques of staging and accounts of festive celebrations. Includes videos and attendance at live performances. Texts are taught in translation.    Arthurian Legend   MEDI-UA 800 Identical to COLIT-UA 825, ENGL-UA 717, FREN-UA 813, RELST-UA 800. Offered regularly. 4 points.   Beginning with early stories of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, the course focuses on masterpieces of French, English, and German medieval literature. Through the European literary tradition, students examine larger problems of the development of medieval literature: the conception of history, the rise of the romance genre, the themes of courtly love, the code of chivalry, and philosophical and theological questions as the Arthurian material is developed through the stories of the Holy Grail.    Dante and His World   MEDI-UA 801 Identical to ENGL-UA 143, ITAL-UA 160. Offered every two to three years. Ardizzone, Freccero. 4 points.   Interdisciplinary introduction to late medieval culture, using Dante, its foremost literary artist, as a focus. Attention is directed to literature, art, and music, in addition to political, religious, and social developments of the time. Emphasizes the continuity of the Western tradition, especially the classical background of medieval culture and its transmission to the modern world.    Acting Medieval Literature   MEDI-UA 868 Identical to FREN-UA 868, THEA-UT 732. Offered regularly. Vitz. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of books to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, performing a substantial piece of narrative poetry, singing or playing a body of medieval songs, or choosing a similar activity. Works studied/performed include songs of the troubadours and trouveres; The Song of Roland; Chretien de Troyes's romance, Yvain; French fabliaux; and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.    Passion and Desire in the Middle Ages   MEDI-UA 961 Identical to COLIT-UA 961, FREN-UA 214, RELST-UA 250. Offered regularly. Vitz. 2 points.   Study of the kinds of loves and desires portrayed in medieval literature: passionate love; refined \"courtly\" love; sexual or \"carnal\" love; love of kin; love of country; love of God. Discusses how literary genres can be largely defined by the nature of the desires represented, explores medieval theorists' views of human love, and investigates the conflicts among different kinds of love for medieval people.    Internship   MEDI-UA 980, 981 Prerequisite: written permission of the director of the program. Restricted to majors and minors. 1 to 4 points per term.
