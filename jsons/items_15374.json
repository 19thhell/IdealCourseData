NYU Law in Paris is offered in cooperation with Sciences Po, NYU Law's partner institution in Paris. Courses in European Business Law, International Commercial Arbitration, and International Criminal Justice designed by NYU Law faculty, are offered along with an EU Regulatory Policy Clinic. These courses will be hosted at NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Paris. In addition, students may enroll in select law courses, taught in English, together with French students at Sciences Po.   The program provides the opportunity for students to study French, to interact with a variety of key EU organizations, and to receive instruction from top faculty in the region. In addition to services provided by Sciences Po, NYU Law students have access to the facilities of the NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Paris, which offers study space, student services and administrative support, as well as language instruction. For more information about the site facilities, please visit: http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers/paris.html .   Professor Franco Ferrari is the NYU Faculty Program Director. He oversees the program in coordination with the On-Site Program Director, Professor Emmanuel Gaillard .   Academic Calendar Spring 2015         Arrival and Orientation   During the first week of January       Classes Begin   January 5       Spring Break   February 23 - February 28       French Holiday   April 6       Make up classes/Reading period   April 7 - April 10       Classes End   April 10       Final Exam Period   April 13 - April 17         Courses   Course schedules are available within the ABRA registration system at the same time that regular courses for the spring semester are published.  Some courses may be subject to the adjunct cap. For more information about academic requirements, please visit the Academic Service page here .   All courses administered by NYU Law are evaluated with letter grades, appearing on student transcripts and counting towards the student's GPA. However, courses offered and administered by Sciences Po, the partner institution, will not count towards GPA, only appearing on transcripts as credits earned, rather than as individual courses.   Spring 2015 Courses   NYU Law courses:     EU Regulatory Policy Clinic (Two Seminar Credits and Three Fieldwork Credits).   European Business Law (Three Credits)   International Commercial Arbitration (Three Credits)   International Criminal Justice (Two Credits)     Select Sciences Po courses including:     European Business Deals   EU Competition Law   International Investment Arbitration   International Economic Negotiation     Language Courses: Students who have a working knowledge of the French language will generally receive a greater benefit from their experience. Students are therefore encouraged to take language courses at NYU or elsewhere before participating. Students may also find it useful to take language courses while in residence in the host country. No law school credit, however, will be awarded for courses intended solely for language instruction; NYU language courses will appear in transcripts.   Tuition and Living Costs   Students participating in NYU Law Abroad pay full tuition to NYU Law for the semester. Tuition covers a full course load; students who wish to take additional courses may do so at an additional expense. Information about NYU Law School tuition can be found in the following link: http://www.law.nyu.edu/financialaid/budgetandbudgeting/studentexpensebudget/index.htm   For information about cost of living and other expenses please visit: http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers/paris/admitted-students/costs-budgeting/cost-of-living0.html   Housing   Students can find their own apartment before they arrive by working with a recommended rental agency.   Passport, Visa and Residence Permit Requirements   Students should obtain the necessary passport and visa to study in France. Students can coordinate the process with the Office of Global Services .   Access for Persons with Disabilities   Unfortunately, the NYU Paris Academic Center facilities are not fully accessible for persons with disabilities. Should you have any questions regarding access, please contact us at law.globalstudents@nyu.edu .

However you are not limited to taking the courses listed on this page. You should use this page, in additional to HEC\u2019s course listings (see the 'Exchange Program Course Offer' link to a PDF document), to help you prepare a preliminary list and backup list of courses you want to take abroad. Please note: Accounting courses cannot be taken abroad for credit toward the Accounting or CPA majors/concentrations. However, you are allowed to take up to three Finance classes at HEC for a total of 6 NYU credits (this is an exception to the maximum of two Finance classes allowed at the other IBEX sites).    There is no guarantee that the courses listed here will be offered during the specific semester you study abroad. Once HEC publishes its confirmed courses for the semester you will be attending, you can revise your list as needed based on what is actually being offered. If you see a course on HEC\u2019s website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval.

NYU Law in Paris is offered in cooperation with Sciences Po, NYU Law's partner institution in Paris. Courses in European Business Law, International Commercial Arbitration, and International Criminal Justice designed by NYU Law faculty, are offered along with an EU Regulatory Policy Clinic. These courses will be hosted at NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Paris. In addition, students may enroll in select law courses, taught in English, together with French students at Sciences Po.   The program provides the opportunity for students to study French, to interact with a variety of key EU organizations, and to receive instruction from top faculty in the region. In addition to services provided by Sciences Po, NYU Law students have access to the facilities of the NYU\u2019s Academic Center in Paris, which offers study space, student services and administrative support, as well as language instruction. For more information about the site facilities, please visit: http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers/paris.html .   Professor Franco Ferrari is the NYU Faculty Program Director. He oversees the program in coordination with the On-Site Program Director, Professor Emmanuel Gaillard .   Academic Calendar Spring 2015         Arrival and Orientation   During the first week of January       Classes Begin   January 5       Spring Break   February 23 - February 28       French Holiday   April 6       Make up classes/Reading period   April 7 - April 10       Classes End   April 10       Final Exam Period   April 13 - April 17         Courses   Course schedules are available within the ABRA registration system at the same time that regular courses for the spring semester are published.  Some courses may be subject to the adjunct cap. For more information about academic requirements, please visit the Academic Service page here .   All courses administered by NYU Law are evaluated with letter grades, appearing on student transcripts and counting towards the student's GPA. However, courses offered and administered by Sciences Po, the partner institution, will not count towards GPA, only appearing on transcripts as credits earned, rather than as individual courses.   Spring 2015 Courses   NYU Law courses:     EU Regulatory Policy Clinic (Two Seminar Credits and Three Fieldwork Credits).   European Business Law (Three Credits)   International Commercial Arbitration (Three Credits)   International Criminal Justice (Two Credits)     Select Sciences Po courses including:     European Business Deals   EU Competition Law   International Investment Arbitration   International Economic Negotiation     Language Courses: Students who have a working knowledge of the French language will generally receive a greater benefit from their experience. Students are therefore encouraged to take language courses at NYU or elsewhere before participating. Students may also find it useful to take language courses while in residence in the host country. No law school credit, however, will be awarded for courses intended solely for language instruction; NYU language courses will appear in transcripts.   Tuition and Living Costs   Students participating in NYU Law Abroad pay full tuition to NYU Law for the semester. Tuition covers a full course load; students who wish to take additional courses may do so at an additional expense.

Passport, Visa and Residence Permit Requirements   Students should obtain the necessary passport and visa to study in France. Students can coordinate the process with the Office of Global Services .

Unique to France, the \u201cGrande Ecole\u201d concept was introduced by Napoleon so that \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d could be channeled into his ministries, armies and engineering corps. HEC's School of Management is among the first business schools in Europe and the first in France to hold the Triple Crown Accreditation. HEC has a long-established tradition of welcoming international students to its lively and friendly campus: an ideal environment in which to live and learn for over 3500 students from 80 nationalities in our programs.\" - HEC Paris     Note : Stern has established an UNDERGRADUATE exchange with HEC at the third year (or what they call \"foundation\" year) of their five-year program for top French students. The HEC five-year program consists of two year of rigorous study that some consider equivalent to the first two years of a bachelors program. This is is followed by an additional three-year program where students complete their bachelor studies and then commence their master level studies. HEC students earn a master's degree at the end of their five year program.
