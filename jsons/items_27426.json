I took another     photo, and thought I really should be writing down the time of each     click. But I couldn't do that either.

With Freud\u2019s book on Totem and Taboo and the fragments on The Man Moses as a starting point, we  will read key texts on philosophical anthropology from the first half of the 20th  century (Scheler, Plessner, Gehlen). The seminar also intends to address the  religious and political dimensions of the question: \u201cWas ist der Mensch?\u201d Therefore,  our discussion will include texts by Franz Rosenzweig, and Hannah Arendt. *This course will be conducted in German.

What  are the ethical, political, cultural, legal and personal stakes in witnessing?  Can photography and other media turn us into witnesses, or do we have to  witness events personally for our testimony to be valid? What is the difference  between documenting and witnessing an event? What is the difference between  rendering an account and giving testimony? What role has photography played in  the formation of our contemporary understanding of witnessing, and how does  contemporary photography bear witness?   Witnessing is a critical concept in  religion, law and science that has received renewed attention in recent years  in the fields of art, photography, literature and cultural studies as well. The  course will examine foundational texts on the notion of witnessing to arrive at  a working definition that distinguishes witnessing from documentation. A  parallel focus will be on photography\u2019s particular function as witness, and on  the changing nature of both the medium and the needs for historical witnessing  in our time.  Readings by Jorge Borges, Walter  Benjamin, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, Nadine Gordimer, John Berger,  Roland Barthes, Shoshana Felman, Cathy Caruth, Dora Apel, Hilton Als, Judith  Butler, Tim O\u2019Brien, Susan Sontag, Barbie Zelizer and others.

Together with Dr. Tawada, we  will read E.T.A.

After the end of Yoko Tawada\u2019s time at NYU, the seminar will focus on reading  Rilke\u2019s lyrical poetry and poems in prose, focusing mainly on the Duino Elegies for the last sessions of  the term. *This course will be  conducted in German.

Fracture lines begin to emerge in those narratives, however,  when Viennese modernism is read against the backdrop of the tense political and  social climate of the late Habsburg empire, which was threatening to pull apart  at the seams. This interdisciplinary seminar will map the flowering of  modernism in Vienna across literature, film, art, architecture, and philosophy,  but it reads the rich cultural production as questioning not only what it meant  to be \u201cmodern,\u201d but also what it meant to be living the \u201cjoyous apocalypse\u201d  (Broch) in the empire\u2019s twilight years. We will consider Viennese modernism\u2019s  role in its wider European context, while also investigating how Vienna 1900 has entered  historiography and the popular imagination, becoming a culture industry unto  itself. Look at Schnitzler, Hofmannsthal, Kraus, Broch, Roth, Musil; Klimt, Schiele,  Loos; Freud, Herzl, and Wittgenstein in a new light. Taught in English.

Realism emerged in the late middle ages before any  critical terms were available to analyze and justify it. Realism was defined  oppositionally: as prose, not poetry; as  profanity, not the sacred; and vernacular or popular, not the language of learning  and authority. The seminar will interpret primary texts and images produced  mainly in the German-speaking lands between about 1400 and 1600, including: saints\u2019  legends, profane legends, vernacular retellings of the Gospel, depictions of  the lives of the Holy Family and the saints, fables and proverbs, depictions of  labor, literature of pilgrimage, Till Eulenspiegel ,  textual and pictorial propaganda of the Protestant Reformation, paintings and  prints by D\u00fcrer, Cranach, and others, Hans Sachs, J\u00f6rg Wickram, Johann Fischart.  The historical material will be framed by critical and theoretical texts of the  twentieth century, including Bakhtin, Shklovsky, Auerbach, Benjamin, Ranci\u00e8re,  and Didi-Huberman.

I wondered if my inability to make sense of what I was seeing had been conditioned by the dominance of this virtual repertoire of images, characters, plotlines. I had seen it all before on computer and television monitors. Did this blinding signal the failure of the live as a means of knowing? Or the triumph of what George Yudice calls the \"Military Industrial Media Complex,\" more commonly known as \"entertainment,\" that has rendered the 'live' one more reiteration? I turned on the TV.  On TV, a narrative sequence was beginning to emerge&#151;people spoke of the attack, the response, \"the world reacts,\" victimization, evil, revenge. But the linear plotline too had little to do with what we were seeing. The images, repeated again and again, froze the moment of impact. TVs multi-frames simultaneously conveyed and controlled the crisis&#151;in one tight box, a speaker delivered an opinion. In another, frantic videos taken with hand held cameras caught the panic that I couldn't see from my window. On the bottom of the screen, the information loop also kept repeating, freezing time. The time of the first attack, 8:46 am, the time of the second, 9:02 am... The loop caught the movement and the stasis of the phenomenon, the obsessive coming back to that one fixed moment. Then the frames shifted again&#151;now a steady Guiliani dominated the foreground, pushing havoc into the tight background box. I ran back to the window.     The towers smoldered silently in the distance, waves of smoke stuck     in the too-blue sky. Time itself seemed to have stopped, conjured     into fixity perhaps by the TV's invocation of the first strike, then     the second. It looked as if the towers would just keep standing there,     smoldering. More photos. Seeing through the lens extended the reach     and holding power of my vision. Aware that a historical event was     overtaking my capacity to understand it, I too wanted to contain the     moment and freeze it for later. TV, window, photo, TV, window, photo,     back and forth. Each click of my camera was my own pause/hold, as     I entered into the suspended rhythm of the present. The archival impulse     prompted me to save the images to understand them at some future time.     One day I would write about it, I told myself, even as I considered     taking out my journal and writing about it now . But I couldn't.     I put the now away for later. I envisioned the moment from the post- now ,     what I would do with it from a safe distance, sorting through the     neat, glossy 4x6 images of disaster. Like the TV's now , mine     was already a repeat, a retrospective as I projected myself into the     future, looking back. Photography, at this moment, was paradoxically     both action and anti-action, performance and anti-performance, a doing,     a click, in the face of the impossibility of doing, about the need     to stop everything until I could get a hold of it. I took another     photo, and thought I really should be writing down the time of each     click. But I couldn't do that either. The failures of the archive     linked again to the failures of the 'live.' I went back to the TV,     my options limited to a back-and-forth. On TV, I heard that the south     tower had fallen. I rushed back to the window. I couldn't believe     I hadn't seen it 'live.'           one tower folded, then two...                                             continue&gt;"}, {"content": "Spring 2015 Schedule    | German | NYU                                                                                                                                                     Back to Previous Page         Spring 2015 Schedule      Spring  2015 Schedule    GERM-GA1116  T  3:30  \u2013 6:10   Origins  of Critical Thought II: Philosophische Anthropologie: Arendt, Rosenzweig,  Plessner    Eckart  Goebel  Although a certain familiarity with Kant and Hegel  is desirable, taking this course (which is conducted in German) does not  require the participation in its first part (Fall 14).

What  are the ethical, political, cultural, legal and personal stakes in witnessing?  Can photography and other media turn us into witnesses, or do we have to  witness events personally for our testimony to be valid? What is the difference  between documenting and witnessing an event? What is the difference between  rendering an account and giving testimony? What role has photography played in  the formation of our contemporary understanding of witnessing, and how does  contemporary photography bear witness?   Witnessing is a critical concept in  religion, law and science that has received renewed attention in recent years  in the fields of art, photography, literature and cultural studies as well. The  course will examine foundational texts on the notion of witnessing to arrive at  a working definition that distinguishes witnessing from documentation. A  parallel focus will be on photography\u2019s particular function as witness, and on  the changing nature of both the medium and the needs for historical witnessing  in our time.

Fracture lines begin to emerge in those narratives, however,  when Viennese modernism is read against the backdrop of the tense political and  social climate of the late Habsburg empire, which was threatening to pull apart  at the seams. This interdisciplinary seminar will map the flowering of  modernism in Vienna across literature, film, art, architecture, and philosophy,  but it reads the rich cultural production as questioning not only what it meant  to be \u201cmodern,\u201d but also what it meant to be living the \u201cjoyous apocalypse\u201d  (Broch) in the empire\u2019s twilight years. We will consider Viennese modernism\u2019s  role in its wider European context, while also investigating how Vienna 1900 has entered  historiography and the popular imagination, becoming a culture industry unto  itself. Look at Schnitzler, Hofmannsthal, Kraus, Broch, Roth, Musil; Klimt, Schiele,  Loos; Freud, Herzl, and Wittgenstein in a new light. Taught in English.

Realism emerged in the late middle ages before any  critical terms were available to analyze and justify it. Realism was defined  oppositionally: as prose, not poetry; as  profanity, not the sacred; and vernacular or popular, not the language of learning  and authority. The seminar will interpret primary texts and images produced  mainly in the German-speaking lands between about 1400 and 1600, including: saints\u2019  legends, profane legends, vernacular retellings of the Gospel, depictions of  the lives of the Holy Family and the saints, fables and proverbs, depictions of  labor, literature of pilgrimage, Till Eulenspiegel ,  textual and pictorial propaganda of the Protestant Reformation, paintings and  prints by D\u00fcrer, Cranach, and others, Hans Sachs, J\u00f6rg Wickram, Johann Fischart.  The historical material will be framed by critical and theoretical texts of the  twentieth century, including Bakhtin, Shklovsky, Auerbach, Benjamin, Ranci\u00e8re,  and Didi-Huberman.

Seminar on post-Symbolist Poetry: Ezra Pound Sieburth Designed to introduce students to Pound\u2019s oeuvre as a whole\u2014and to its central place within ongoing debates about modernism and post-modernism\u2014the course will include readings from Personae, The Cantos, and The Translations, as well as from The Chinese Written character, Literary Essays, Selected Prose, Guide to Kulchur, and selected wartime radio broadcasts. Background readings will include not only such standard works as Kenner\u2019s The Pound Era, but also more recent reassessments of Pound\u2019s poetics, politics, and economics. Pound= \u201can enclosure for stray animals.\u201d Special Topics in Theory: The Subject of Freedom Basterra      Freedom,  writes Kant, manifests itself through the moral law, which \u201cthrusts itself upon  us on its own.\u201d Freedom, Levinas would  write almost two centuries later, is \u201cineluctably invoked\u201d by a command that  \u201cslips in me like a thief.\u201d Should we understand freedom as being inseparable  from obligation, from a responsibility one has not chosen to take in any  present? And if the law that obligates  us does not exactly originate in ourselves, would autonomy consist in believing  oneself the author of \u2013 and thus becoming responsible for \u2013 something one has  received?      This  seminar explores freedom theoretically as a concept that enables thinking by  introducing a boundary, and practically as something other that animates  subjectivity. It begins by analyzing the  possibilities the exceptional concept of freedom opens up for theoretical  reason in Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason.    But freedom would be inconceivable without presupposing the idea of a  subject through which freedom would manifest itself. For there to be freedom, there have to be  subjects animated by freedom, subjects which, traversed by freedom, could  introduce its effects in the world. In  being constituted by freedom, the subject could then be imagined to play the  role of limit that enables theoretical thinking, but the ability to undestand  how freedom affects subjects and motivates the power of desire lies beyond  theoretical reason\u2019s reach.      Careful  readings of Kant\u2019s \u201cAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes  into Philosophy\u201d (1763), and of selections from Dreams of a Spirit-Seer (1766),  Critique of Pure Reason (1781/87), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and  Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason (1793) will structure our  discussions. We will put them in  conversation with works by Rousseau, Heidegger, Deleuze, Nancy, Levinas.      Topics in Black Literature: Fanon and Glissant Diawara The  purpose of this course is to explore the historical, political and esthetic  contexts which led to the emergence of Fanon\u2019s seminal texts of decolonization and  cultural nationalism ( Black Skin White  Mask and The Wretched of the Earth )  and Glissant\u2019s theories of Creolization and Tout-Monde ( Caribbean Discourse , The  Poetics of Relation , and The  Philosophy of Relation ). It is important to bear in mind that Fanon (1925) and  Glissant (1928) were contemporaries, from the same Island, Martinique, and exposed  to the same French assimilationist education, which was already put to test by  Sartrean readings of Marx and Freud, the affirmations of essential African  identities by the Negritude movement, and the postwar agitations against racism  and colonization.  Discourse and Society: The Renaissance Spatial Turn Duffy This seminar will explore two linked intellectual revolutions: the cosmographic revolution of the European Renaissance and the Postmodern Spatial turn in twentieth and twenty-first-century critical theory and philosophy. Starting from the spatial arguments in Aristotle and Plato through the works of Ortelius, Oronce Fine, Kepler, Mercator, Bruno, and others, we will establish a context in which to consider the spatial turn in the work of philosophers and critics including Foucault, Lefebvre, Deleuze, Soja, Casey, and Conley. Throuhgout the course, we will work to apply this long history of spatial thinking to some major works of European Renaissance literature including Petrarch's Canzoniere and Familiares , Bartolome de las Casas's writings, Joachim du Bellay's Roman poetry, Spenser's Faerie Queene, Donne's lyrics, and Milton's Paradise Lost.      Prisms of Modernity: Bare Life, Fascism, Post-dictatorship &amp; Neoliberalism in Spain Matos-Martin Recent transformative events such  as the financial collapse, the Eurozone crisis, the dismantling of the social  welfare system, labor reforms, austerity measures or massive unemployment have  opened a historical temporality in Spain in which large sectors of society have  been progressively degraded to an \u201cunworthy\u201d and unprotected life, a life with  no proper juridical or socially recognized status\u2014a \u201cbare\u201d life (Agamben). The  existence of such lives, however, are nothing new in Spain. In fact, they have  been widespread with different intensities, of course, not only in times of  hardship but also in periods of economic prosperity. This course proposes an  examination of contemporary Spanish culture following that thread of bare life  and tracing it back to the Spanish Civil War. By comparing and relating today\u2019s  massive precarization of bodies with memories of previous experiences of  marginalization, abandonment or exclusion (Franco\u2019s regime, the so-called  transition to democracy, and post-dictatorial Spain), we might study the dark  side of Spanish Modernity. Theoretical readings might include, among others,  Benjamin, Arendt, Schmitt, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Butler, Negri and  Ranci\u00e8re.     Documents and Documentary Modes in Literature, Film, and Visual Culture Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the  newsreel, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary  books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal  documentary films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development  affected our other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship  between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print,  photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the  artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document,  \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration,  and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and  theoretical readings by Paula Amad, Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi,  Jane Gaines, Carlo Ginzburg, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson,  Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re,  Edward Said, Alan Sekula, Sven Spieker, Ann Stoler, Diana Taylor, and others. This semester's special topics are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment archive or in an archive of your choice.      Topics in Lit &amp; Modern Culture: Queer Critique Huber      This seminar begins with a brief genealogy  of critique, focusing primarily on its modern itinerary as a practice or ethos  that exposes the complexity, contingency and violence in the given order of  things. At the outset, we will rely on Kant\u2019s model of critique as a patient  reflection on the limits of reason, but we will follow the practice as it  deviates and disperses, tending toward an attitude that seeks not simply to  limn limits, but to radically question them. Critique begins then to ask after  other ways of being, doing and thinking. We will read Foucault and Butler for  their accounts of critique as a richly embodied, urgent and often risky  practice, paying particular attention to the elaboration of an ethics and  critical practice enabled by one\u2019s perspectives and unruly investments, shaped  as these are by larger sexual, racial and class formations. How might our  desires incite critique, and how might critique, in turn, incite our desires?  Queer and critique are terms that slide with great latitude; we will ask if  there is a tacit traffic between them. Is there something decidedly queer about  critique? In the seminar\u2019s final  section, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz, Ferguson, Reddy, and  Chen), in order to move toward a fuller consideration of those powers that  produce, organize, constrain, differentiate and mobilize us.       Readings will include: Plato, Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, Gramsci,  Luk\u00e1cs, Benjamin, Koselleck, Foucault, Butler, Mbembe, Spivak, Brown, Asad, Mahmood, Eng, Shah,  Mu\u00f1oz, Ferguson, Chen among others.
