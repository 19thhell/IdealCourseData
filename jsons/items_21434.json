Ideally, the faculty portfolio will prove most helpful to you during the tenure and promotion process.   This portfolio primarily covers your teaching activities. You may also include other relevant accomplishments. Keep in mind, that there is no need to duplicate materials that are sufficiently represented in your CV or Departmental review form.      1.1 How can I access ePortfolio?     You can access ePortfolio by logging-in to the ALEX portal and clicking on the ePortfolio link, located on the My Workspace page.      1.2 When I access ePortfolio, it says &quot;There are no portfolios associated&hellip;&quot;         This screen appears exclusively upon your initial login to ePortfolio.     Simply select your role as either &quot;Faculty&quot; or &quot;Student&quot;, and the selected portfolio type will be added to your account. In the event that you wish to add an additional portfolio type, please contact ALEX Support and we will be happy to include the extra portfolio in your account.      1.3 What should I do if I don&rsquo;t see a portfolio type I should have access to?     Please contact ALEX Support, so that we can troubleshoot this issue for you.      Please note: ePortfolio is not yet supported on mobile devices.      2.0 LEFT PANEL: &quot;My Portfolios&quot;, &quot;My Reports&quot; and &quot;Mentoring&quot;      2.1 What does the &quot;My Portfolios&quot; list mean?     The titles listed under the main &quot;My Portfolios&quot; header are those portfolios to which you have access. For additional portfolio privileges, please contact ALEX Support.      2.2 What does the &quot;My Reports&quot; list mean?     The titles listed under the main &quot;My Reports&quot; header are those reports to which you have access. For additional report privileges, please contact ALEX Support.      2.3 What does the &quot;Mentoring&quot; section feature?     The mentoring section displays the mentor/mentee relationships relevant to your account.          For example, this specific account has both a mentor relationship established, as well as a mentee relationship. That is to say that in one instance this specific user serves as someone&rsquo;s mentor and in another instance this same user has a mentor.      3.0 MENTORING      3.1 What is a mentor?     A mentor is typically a faculty member who monitors an individual&rsquo;s progress over a sustained period of time and provides feedback where applicable. Those who are assigned as mentors can view mentee portfolios and complete any relevant mentor forms.     Mentors can access their mentees&rsquo; portfolios three different ways:        Selecting the &quot;My mentees&quot; link, located on the left panel.      Clicking on a Published Report&rsquo;s static link      Accessing a Published Report&rsquo;s PDF        Method 1 is via the ePortfolio interface, whereas methods 2 and 3 are personally shared by the mentees.      ePortfolio Mentees View:           3.2 What are the Form types?     There are two different form types: Learner forms and Mentor forms. Learner forms are viewable to the specific user, as well as the assigned Mentors. Mentor forms are viewable by the specific mentors who&rsquo;ve submitted entries, as well as those with &quot;Admin access.&quot; Additionally, Mentor forms possess privacy settings such that entries can be made visible to all mentors by selecting the &quot;Yes&quot; radio button within an individual entry.          In the above example, all assigned mentors will have access to this entry. If &quot;No&quot; were selected, then only the specific mentor who filled-out the form will have viewing privileges.      3.3 What is &quot;Admin access&quot;?     &quot;Admin access&quot; denotes those users who have privileges to add PDF content to individual portfolios. The &quot;Admin access&quot; role is intended to be purely administrative and does not possess the ability to see Learner forms.     The &quot;Bulk upload&quot; feature is specific to those with &quot;Admin access&quot; roles. In order to attach documents to an individual&rsquo;s portfolio, someone must have an &quot;Admin access&quot; role for that specific user. The requests for these pairings should be submitted to ALEX Support.     Once someone has &quot;Admin access&quot; privileges for the specific accounts, they can upload documents by clicking on the &quot;bulk upload&quot; feature located next to the chosen user.      The filename of the uploaded PDFs must be the Kerberos ID of the assigned mentee.      3.4 What if I don&rsquo;t see a mentee listed under &quot;My mentees&quot;?     Please submit your request for mentor/mentee pairings to ALEX Support.      4.0 PORTFOLIO ORGANIZATION      4.1 How is the Faculty Teaching Portfolio organized?     The Faculty Teaching Portfolio is divided into a matrix, which consists of six cells:         Personal Statement and Long-term Goals       Teaching Effort       Mentoring and Advising       Administration and Leadership       Committees and Teaching Awards       Optional Supporting Evidence       To add an entry to a particular category, click on the name of the section. Each category, with the exception of &quot;Personal Statement&hellip;&quot; has an &quot;Add new entry&quot; option, located within the &quot;Data&quot; field.     As older form entries were transitioned to the new version of ePortfolio 2.0 during the upgrade, you may notice entries with a red asterisk next to the title. The red asterisk simply denotes an old form, no longer in use by the current system.     Additionally, entries with an icon next to the title denote a &quot;from-feed&quot; form. This simply means that the information within the form was retrieved from another source (e.g. e*value):           4.2 What do the &quot;Actions&quot; within each form category mean?          The &quot;Actions&quot; displayed showcase the customizability of each form category.     You may edit existing entries by selecting the &quot;pencil&quot; icon. Similarly, you might copy the form in its entirety and edit individual elements of the copied entry. This can be achieved by clicking on the &quot;Copy entry&quot; icon next to the chosen form.     You can also organize entries by creating a folder&mdash;the &quot;Add folder&quot; button is located on the right-hand side of the &quot;Data&quot; box.          Material within each form category can be organized according to your specific preferences.      4.3 How can I attach supplemental materials to my portfolio?      Faculty Portfolios: Additional documentation can be appended to a Faculty Teaching Portfolio by clicking on the &quot;Optional Supporting Evidence&quot; icon. From here, select &quot;Add new Supporting Document.&quot; All files must be in PDF format.     Note: You may upload PowerPoint material, after the file has been converted to a PDF.           5.0 PUBLISHING &amp; SHARING REPORTS     To access the publishing feature, select &quot;Publish/Download&quot; on the top navigational toolbar.           5.1 Default Reports     A default report contains all content that exists within the associated portfolio. Each section and existing entries will be visible.     To download the exhaustive default portfolio report, click on the PDF link under &quot;Default report&quot;.      5.2 Customized Reports     A custom report allows you to determine which sections within an associated portfolio are visible. You will also have the opportunity to include, exclude, and reorder entries within a given section. You will be able to provide a unique name for the report and can include contact information and your CV.     In order to customize your report, select the &quot;Create Custom report&quot; link next to the portfolio that you would like to personalize:           Note: The link will read &quot;Customize: add/edit content&quot; if you have previously edited the report.     In this section you can begin to make the desired changes to the portfolio content to be published. All of the information included in your default report is accessible to you&mdash;but only the selected material will be included in your final customized report.     This section is highly customizable. You may even edit the title of the report by selecting the pencil icon to the right of the title header:          From here, you may edit the General Information section to reflect your preferred contact information. Additionally, you can upload a picture and/or your CV.          The Document section displays the overall content from your entire portfolio. Eye icons are located to the right of the section titles. These icons show which sections will be visible or hidden in the published report. Sections with content are shown with an open eye icon and are visible by default. Sections without any entries are shown with a closed eye icon and are hidden by default.          In the above example, only the Mentoring and Advising section will be visible in the final report.     You can further customize each section by clicking on the section title and &quot;closing&quot; or &quot;opening&quot; the eye icons. Within each individual section, you can also rearrange the order of entries by &quot;dragging&quot; and &quot;dropping&quot; the rows.     After the report has been customized, press the save button.      5.3 Sharing Reports     Once you are satisfied with the customized report, select the &quot;not shared&quot; link in the Custom Report box on the main Publish/Download screen.          At this point, you can now &quot;make [the report] fully public&quot; and press the Save button.          Copy the View Web Version link to share the portfolio with others.                                               Call us for more information: 212-263-7300       NYULMC Home   Site Map"}]},

Content Areas      1. Personal Statement &amp; Long Term Goals     Develop a reflective statement that describes how and why you &quot;do what you do&quot; and its fit with your area of specialization.     Long Term Goals: Include clearly stated personal goals for your professional growth and development.      2. Teaching Effort     The most recent iteration of ePortfolio includes the following categories that capture your contributions to:         Teaching ( medical students, residents, fellows, faculty, community, etc.)         Each Teaching Activity entry should showcase an instance wherein you&rsquo;ve facilitated learning in an educational setting.           Curriculum Development          A Curriculum Development Activity entry should reflect your overall contributions regarding the design of a specific learning module or experience.           Please note: The ePortfolio application is designed to help individual faculty members present a richer picture of their contributions than is traditionally captured within the curriculum vitae. The ePortfolio continues to evolve to better meet the needs of faculty seeking promotion; as such, it may soon include broader categories that will account for accomplishments and activities that fall outside the current Teaching Effort heading.      3. Mentoring and Advising     Include mentoring and advising of medical students, residents, fellows, and faculty. Sections should describe your mentoring activities for each category with names of those mentored, nature of the mentoring activity for each, and the outcome of supervision (e.g., any resulting publications, presentations, theses or grant awards).      4. Administration and Leadership     Include roles as leader or co-leader of clinical and/or educational programs.      5. Committees and Teaching Awards     This section captures any committees (local or national) for which you were a member or held a leadership role. Also include any teaching awards received, with dates and sponsoring institution or organization. Describe each award briefly, including the criterion on which the award is based.      6. Optional Supporting Evidence (PDFs)     The last category in the Faculty Portfolio matrix is optional, and is intended to allow faculty to append relevant material in PDF format that otherwise falls outside of the scope of the previous five categories, or spans multiple categories. The supplemental material will be seamlessly included in your published portfolio as integrated appendices.
