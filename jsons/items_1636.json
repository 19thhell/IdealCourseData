Classroom and case discussions helped us translate those perspectives, theories, and concepts into our own work environment.

Classroom and case discussions helped us translate those perspectives, theories, and concepts into our own work environment.

Or they may begin, complete, and rewrite a new full-length play. If you plan to do a new work you must come to the first class with three ideas for full-length plays. Each idea can be described in one or two paragraphs. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .

Screenwriting I    NCRD-UT 8003    A screenwriting workshop required of all Dramatic Writing majors and also designed for new screenwriters. Students are required to complete 50-70 pages of a full-length screenplay with an outline of the rest.

Students must come to the first class with three ideas for full-length screenplays. Each idea can be described in one or two paragraphs. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .      Writing the One-Hour Television Drama    NCRD-UT 8008 Pre-requisite: Intro to Writing the Half Hour Comedy       A course for starting a one-hour dramatic script, OR for revising/completing a One-Hour script begun last year. (Students will arrive at this class at different levels of expertise.) For those students new to writing a One-Hour, this television workshop course takes the student step by step through writing their own script for an ongoing one-hour television dramatic series. The course will go from premise lines, through the outline, to writing a solid draft of the script. This is a high-level course that prepares students for the professional world. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .      Intro to Writing the Half Hour Comedy    NCRD-UT 8005 This intensive scriptwriting class answers the question, \u201cWhat do I need to break into TV writing?\u201d The student will be guided through the step-by-step development of an episode for an ongoing TV sitcom, from premise line to one-page outline, to pages and revisions. The course requires the completion of a polished draft while introducing students to the rigors of professional standards through weekly story goals. The course is taught by a professional television writer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683  View course schedule .      Sketch Comedy Writing NCRD-UT 8012 This is a sketch writing workshop class. A survey of sketch genres and approaches will be integrated with writing assignments and rewriting of one's own sketches: both privately and collaboratively. The goal is for each student to emerge from the class with several polished sketches. For this class, it helps to have a good sense of humor that you want to get even better at putting down on the page. There will be a lot of group critiquing and occasionally group rewriting. So it helps to stop thinking that your first draft is perfect. Because it isn't. This can be a pretty wild class, so it also helps to never think that comedy can go \"too far.\" The course may have a guest lecturer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .
