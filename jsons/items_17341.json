These systems have to be continuously adapted and upgraded (often with technology-driven solutions) to efficiently support the essential public services, urban development and economic growth.   The infrastructure systems support a variety of urban sectors, including transportation, energy &amp; water supply, sanitation &amp; wastewater management, and other essential services. Their sustainable development engages a wide variety of public and private sector stakeholders and greatly depends on a broad range of factors, such as public policy objectives, land use and geo-physical system characteristics, regulatory requirements, and other variables. Both Government and Industry presently face increasing needs for innovative capabilities of dynamic monitoring and &ldquo;smart&rdquo; system control to effectively meet the challenge of upgrading the aging urban infrastructure systems.   With specialized faculty members from Government, Industry and Academia, the program is designed for professionals, with both engineering and non-engineering backgrounds, who are involved and/or interested in the fast growing inter-disciplinary field of urban systems management and career opportunities with government agencies, public and private sector utilities, and service industries across the wide array of the metropolitan sectors.   Admissions Requirements   This program is open to professionals with BS or BA degrees and backgrounds in engineering, science, public policy, management, economics, and/or finance. Necessary mathematics background, usually including undergraduate calculus, is required, as is an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or better.   All applicants for this MS program must additionally show evidence of general quantitative analytic ability, including a minimum of 2 years of college mathematics and a college-level course in statistics.
