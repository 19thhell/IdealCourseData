Mammograms are x-rays of the breasts, and therefore deliver a small dose of radiation. See radiation risks for more information.       Screening mammograms are done for women that are having no symptoms, problems, or concerns and have never had breast cancer. This is recommended on an annual basis starting at age 40, unless the patient is high risk in which case screening may begin earlier.       Diagnostic mammograms are performed for several reasons:   If additional images are needed after screening mammogram   Patient has a new symptom or concern such as feeling a new lump   Patients who have had breast cancer   Patients that are undergoing short-term follow-up for a finding that is likely benign.       Ultrasound   Ultrasounds\u00a0 can be done for screening purposes, as part of your annual exam in addition to your mammogram if you have dense breast tissue, for problem solving purposes if an area on mammogram is in question, or if you feel a lump. Ultrasound uses sound waves to make images of the breasts, therefore no radiation is used.         Magnetic Resonance Imaging   MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a screening and diagnostic test that uses magnetic fields and pulses of radiowaves to produce images. For evaluation of the breasts, this test usually requires an intravenous injection of contrast material called gadolinium. This will allow abnormalities in the breast to become highlighted. Some patients are considered high risk and may qualify to have this test yearly for screening purposes. It is very important that this test is done between days 7-14 of your menstrual cycle because hormonal changes can alter the appearance of breasts on MRI and may lead to inaccurate results. For this test an IV will be placed for the injection of the contrast. You will be lying face down with the breast coming through an opening in the table. The test lasts approximately 45 minutes and requires you to be as still as possible. Some patients are unable to have MRI and other women may have difficulty with MRI if they are claustrophobic.

Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.   \u00a0   \u2028Course Description Currently, across most US radiation therapy treatment centers, breast treatment is performed in the supine position. Technically, prone radiation therapy is complex, requiring expertise in patient immobilization, table design, simulation and treatment. \u00a0At NYU, we have over 14 years of experience in treating patients in the prone position. \u00a0Although this course has been offered a number of times over the past several years, there are still a great number of clinicians who are not treating in the prone position and who need to be educated in this modality.   The\u00a0 NYU Prone Breast Radiotherapy Technique \u00a0course will provide an overview of the rationale for and practical, \u201chands-on\u201d teaching of the NYU prone treatment technique. \u00a0The NYU Radiation Oncology protocols, which utilize IMRT planning techniques for both partial, whole breast and nodal treatment in the prone position, will be described. \u00a0In addition, the organ dose exposure to heart and lung will be outlined.   The course will be structured over 2 days, the first of which will include didactic lectures on the protocols utilized and methodology, while the second day sessions will include hands-on teaching of techniques with ample time for questions and answers, demonstrations and real-time application of learned methodologies of prone breast treatment.   \u00a0   Target Audience The course is targeted at radiation oncologists, physicists and therapists interested in learning the prone technique for external beam breast cancer radiation therapy. \u00a0   \u00a0   Refund Policy In order to request a refund, you must \u00a0 click here \u00a0 to complete and submit our online refund form no later than 14 days prior to the first day of the course. An administrative fee of $75 will be deducted from your refund. Cancelations or no-shows after this date are not eligible for a refund. Fax and email cancelations are not accepted.   \u00a0   Course Cancelation Policy In the unusual circumstance that this course is canceled, two weeks notice will be given and tuition will be refunded in full.
