Ranging from mesmerism and phrenology to physiology, genetics, and neuroscience, it will consider the development over time of knowledge about the brain and its relationship to the body. The course will also analyze the ways in which this knowledge has been applied in medicine, law, economics, government policy, and religion. Some of the topics we will look at include the following: mind-body dualism, neuron theory, psychoanalysis and biology, brain imaging, the molecular and plastic brain, and psychotropic drugs. The course takes a primarily historical approach to this topic, but work from other academic disciplines that engage with related questions will also be addressed. The last third of the course will focus on recent history and contemporary issues surrounding the \u201ccentury of the brain.\u201d One of our challenges will be to examine what history and science and technology studies more broadly might contribute to ongoing conversations about minds and bodies.

Ranging from mesmerism and phrenology to physiology, genetics, and neuroscience, it will consider the development over time of knowledge about the brain and its relationship to the body. The course will also analyze the ways in which this knowledge has been applied in medicine, law, economics, government policy, and religion. Some of the topics we will look at include the following: mind-body dualism, neuron theory, psychoanalysis and biology, brain imaging, the molecular and plastic brain, and psychotropic drugs. The course takes a primarily historical approach to this topic, but work from other academic disciplines that engage with related questions will also be addressed. The last third of the course will focus on recent history and contemporary issues surrounding the \u201ccentury of the brain.\u201d One of our challenges will be to examine what history and science and technology studies more broadly might contribute to ongoing conversations about minds and bodies.

It has been the home of great scientists who made contributions well beyond their immediate fields of study. Since its inception, research from the department has led to a better understanding of the body and in recent years, the mind. Partnerships between clinical and basic research labs continue to impact patient health. Click through to explore just some of the milestones that have made the Department of Neuroscience and Physiology an integral part of the NYU School of Medicine.                  Milestones         Previous Next                           1850                             The Department of Physiology is founded at University Medical College.                 John W. Draper, MD, a founder of the school, served as head of the department (1850-1867) and president of the college (1850-1873). He was a renaissance man with interests in chemistry, medicine, philosophy, history, and religion. He was the first person to produce a clear photograph of the female face, the moon, and an object under a microscope. His book, History of the Conflict between Religion and Science , was internationally acclaimed yet controversial.                                   1861                             Bellevue Hospital Medical College is co-founded by Austin Flint II.                 Austin Flint II, MD co-founded the hospital with his father and served as Chair of the Department and Professor of Physiology and Microscopy from 1861-1897. He developed a specialization in the physiology of mental states. His work, The Physiology of Man , published in five volumes between 1867 and 1873, became a sought-after reference. In 1874 he was appointed surgeon general of the state of New York and served at that post for 4 years.                                   1898                             University and Bellevue Hospital Medical Colleges merge.                 Graham Lusk, PhD served as a Professor of Physiology and the first chair of the newly combined department from 1898-1908. Dr. Lusk is known for his role in founding the Harvey Society and his important contributions to the science of diabetes and nutrition. His textbook The Elements of the Science of Nutrition (1906) was the standard work on the topic at the time of its publication.                                    1930                             Homer W. Smith brings together clinical and basic scientists.                 During his tenure as chair of the department from 1930-1961, Homer W. Smith, PhD, far right established strong collaborations between clinical and basic laboratories. He is considered a pioneer in the field of renal physiology and an award in his name is given out annually by the American Society of Nephrology.                                   1955                             The Medical Science Building, home of the department, opens.                 The picture above, dated 1952, shows the Medical Science Building (MSB) during its construction. The doors officially opened in 1955 and MSB became home to many laboratories and offices, including the Department of Physiology and Biophysics. The building still stands in the heart of the NYU Langone Medical Center.                                   1976                             Dr. Rodolfo Llin&aacute;s ushers in the era of neuroscience research at NYU School of Medicine.                 From 1976 until 2011, Rodolfo Llin&aacute;s, MD, PhD, chaired the department and along with faculty that included Drs. Robert Baker, Dean Hillman, J. Charles Nicholson, and John Simpson, began to steer the department towards neuroscience. In 2011, NYU named Dr. Llin&aacute;s a University Professor, the first time such an honor was bestowed upon a medical center faculty member.                                    1995                             The department is renamed the Department of Physiology and Neuroscience                 Reflecting the scope of the research being done in the department, The NYU School of Medicine changes the name of the department.                                   2012                             Dr. Richard Tsien becomes chair of the department.                 In January 2012, Richard Tsien, DPhil took over the helm of the department and solidified NYU&#39;s commitment to neuroscience and translational research. His roles as chair of the department and director of the Neuroscience Institute will allow him to foster the next generation of neuroscience at NYU and to build on the already existing relationship between the basic and clinical departments.                                   2012                             Neuroscience and Physiology continues to grow into the future.                 In collaboration with the Neuroscience Institute, the Department of Neuroscience and Physiology will continue to hire new faculty members who bring cutting edge techniques and research plans to the study of the brain and the body.
