To assist students in their efforts to make a significant contribution in this area, Stern created the Social Impact Internship Fund (SIIF), a financial stipend of up to $10,000, which supports first-year, full-time MBA students who wish to complete a summer internship working at the intersection of business and society, where they can use their business education to positively impact the broader world around them. SIIF recipients have worked with non-profit organizations, for-profit social enterprises, and started their own social ventures.                                               The SIIF Experience     Watch MBA alumni Matt Edmundson and Jenny Tsai reflect on their efforts to tackle iron-deficiency anemia among pregnant women in India. SIIF funding allowed them to spend a summer working in Bangalore on the project.

To assist students in their efforts to make a significant contribution in this area, Stern created the Social Impact Internship Fund (SIIF), a financial stipend of up to $10,000, which supports first-year, full-time MBA students who wish to complete a summer internship working at the intersection of business and society, where they can use their business education to positively impact the broader world around them. SIIF recipients have worked with non-profit organizations, for-profit social enterprises, and started their own social ventures.                                               The SIIF Experience     Watch MBA alumni Matt Edmundson and Jenny Tsai reflect on their efforts to tackle iron-deficiency anemia among pregnant women in India. SIIF funding allowed them to spend a summer working in Bangalore on the project.
