Including a substantial field-based component, our programs are based on communicative methods of second language acquisition and a reflective model of teaching which incorporate collaboration with colleagues, students, and community.    Our goal is to prepare professionals with a firm foundation in language, literacy, and applied linguistics along with an understanding of a range of second language teaching approaches that can be adjusted to suit the needs of different learner populations from diverse educational and ethnic backgrounds. The TESOL programs affirm the value of heritage languages and cultures and take an additive view of second language acquisition.    Post-Baccalaureate Advanced Certificate Program in TESOL    The post-baccalaureate advanced certificate is designed for students who are interested in teaching English abroad or choosing a second career in teaching English as a second/foreign language. It can be a bridge to the master's degree in TESOL.    For more information about the program, contact Shondel Nero .    Learn more about the application requirements for the post-baccalaureate advanced certificate program .    TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), M.A.    The master's degree programs prepare teachers of English to non-English speakers. Students can choose between a 34-credit program designed for teaching college students, adults, and TESOL in an international setting, and a 44-credit program for K-12 teaching in the United States which can lead to New York state certification.

The programs lead to eligibility for dual certification in Teaching French or Spanish for grades 7-12 and in Teaching English as a Second Language for grades K-12 in New York State.
