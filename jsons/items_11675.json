After briefly discussing Meehan\u2019s contexts, influences and early work, the talk focusses on the role of loss, memory and creative recuperation in the collection. 11:00: Refreshment break. We\u2019ll have books and other items for sale. 11:15: \u201c\u2018Excess of Love\u2019: Yeats and the Rebels of 1916\u201d Lucy McDiarmid, Marie Frazee-Baldassare Professor of English at Montclair State, looks at the relation between romantic love and political idealism in the lives of the 1916 rebels, contrasting the way Yeats sees that relation in his poetry (\u201cHearts with one purpose alone\u201d) and the way the executed men saw themselves. 12:30 : Luncheon on your own, with many Greenwich Village restaurants to choose from (we\u2019ll give you a list). 2:00: \u201cYeats in America\u201d Yeats visited the U.S. five times between 1903 and 1923. All the tours had fund-raising purposes: for the Irish theater, Thoor Ballylee, John Butler Yeats or the Irish Academy of Letters. John Harrington , dean of faculty of arts and science at Fordham, discusses how on these tours Yeats used his position as an international figure to promote Ireland\u2019s arts and culture. 2:45: \u201cIgnored: Yeats\u2019s William Allingham\u201d When considering Yeats\u2019s formative Irish influences, critics regularly mention the so-called Bard of Ballyshannon. But they typically don\u2019t dwell on him, despite Yeats\u2019s admonition that Allingham should not be \u201cignored.\u201d Howard Keeley , director of the Center for Irish Research and Teaching at Georgia Southern, explores the nexus between the two poets, beginning with the observation that both identified with Protestant merchant families from the coastal west of Ireland.. 3:30: A reading by Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill , a leading poet writing in Irish today. Her writings (she also writes children\u2019s plays, screenplays and essays) focus on traditions and ancient folklore, combined with themes of femininity, sexuality and culture. 4:15-5 Social and a Summer School reunion.
