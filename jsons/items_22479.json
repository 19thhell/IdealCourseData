The focus of the undergraduate program is primarily on language, history and literature and the way in which these three civilizations have interacted with the Western world to reconstitute received cultures into modern societies. By intensive study of Asian culture, the student is encouraged to reflect on the global interrelatedness of human society. At present, three language sequences are offered: a six-semester Chinese language sequence, a six-semester Japanese language sequence, and a six-semester Korean language sequence. Fourth-year study is also offered in all three languages. In addition, various courses in Asian culture are offered in the Program in East Asian Studies, while courses in history, politics, and art are available in other departments.
