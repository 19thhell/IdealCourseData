Fall term of odd years.     Prerequisite: MATH-UA 122 Calculus II or MATH-UA 212 Math for    Economics II (for Economics majors) with a grade of C or    better or the equivalent. Also, MATH-UA 140    Linear Algebra with the grade of C or better is strongly    suggested. This course is only open to Math Education majors and prospective majors.         This is a thorough course in planar Euclidean geometry.    Emphasis is placed on development of students' proof-writing    and problem-solving skills. It begins with a study of the    basic structures (e.g., angles, lines, arcs) and concepts    (e.g.,construction, congruence, similarity) known to Euclid    and builds toward modern results. The second half of the    course will focus on isometries of the plane, their    classification, and applications of complex numbers and    conformal maps to geometry. Time permitting, contrasts will be    made with some non-Euclidean geometries.          MATH-UA 282    Functions of a Complex Variable     4 points. Spring term.
