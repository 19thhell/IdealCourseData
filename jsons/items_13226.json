Person Perception- A Cognitive Approach              PSYCH-GA.2286, Uleman. 3 points              This seminar focuses on a wide selection of current research and theoretical perspectives on how we perceive other people. Topics include how object and person perception differ, developmental and adult versions of &ldquo;theories of mind&rdquo; about others, spontaneous inferences and implicit theories about others, cultural differences in these phenomena, the nature and uses of trait concepts, the interaction of automatic and controlled processes in person perception, and non-verbal cues and communication. Accuracy in person perception, and stereotyping, are major research areas in their own right, and are only briefly considered here. Students are expected to contribute to discussions of the readings each week, make two presentations during the semester on related readings of their choice, and write a research proposal on a topic of particular interest to them. There is also a final exam.                     Foundations of Social Cognition             PSYCH-GA.2291 Staff. 3 points.

Culture and Child Development              PSYCH-GA.3211 Prerequisite: a doctoral-level course in developmental psychology. Staff. 3 points.             Focuses on theoretical and empirical work, from a variety of disciplines (including psychology, anthropology, education sociology, history, and evolutionary psychology), that considers the role of cultural factors in children's cognitive and social development. Rather than simply debating notions of cultural specificity versus universality, participants are asked to consider the potential contribution that analyses of cultural factors can make to our understanding of children's development in general. Students are active participants in organizing and leading class discussion and are required to prepare a research proposal that addresses a specific issue regarding the role of cultural factors in development.

Amodio. 3 points              This course provides a comprehensive overview of topics in the social psychological study of prejudice, stereotyping and intergroup relations. Each week, we will discuss both theoretical and empirical articles related to different topics within this broad field of research. Throughout the course, there will be an emphasis on considering and integrating classic and contemporary approaches to questions of intergroup relations, and discussions will focus on the ability of this research to capture the psychological phenomenon of prejudice, to make contact with other levels of analysis, and to promote social change (i.e., prejudice reduction).                     Social Neuroscience              PSYCH-GA.3381 Amodio. 3 points              This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own program of research.                     Auditory Perception &amp; Cognition              PSYCH-GA.3392 Poeppel. 3 points              A selection of issues from auditory perception and cognition are examined, from theoretical, psychophysical, and cognitive neuroscience perspectives. Topics may include pitch perception, the temporal analysis of sounds, speech perception, multi-sensory processing, MEG approaches to studying hearing and speech, and others.                     Origins of Learning              PSYCH-GA.3399. Adolph. 3 points              This course will explore the origins of learning in several ways. First, we will look for the earliest manifestations of learning in the embryo and fetus. Second, we will discuss the evidence for various learning mechanisms in infants and young children (e.g., habituation, association learning, statistical learning, rule learning, Bayesian learning, analogy, learning sets). Third, we will try to understand the role of development in learning (e.g., whether developmental changes constrain or enhance learning). Finally, we will consider how infants select among possible learning mechanisms. Readings will include classic and recent studies in the human and animal literatures. Several guest authors will join the discussion.                     Self-Regulation              PSYCH-GA.3393              The course provides an overview of major theories and findings in research and self-regulation. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of self-regulation (delay of gratification, resistance to temptation), the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, cognitive-neuropsychological research on self-regulation, and self-regulation from the perspective of economics. We will focus on interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches as well as on designing research that promotes different lines of thinking.                      Developmental Social Cognition              PSYCH-GA.3402.001              This seminar will examine the development of social cognition as a special topic in conceptual development. Major theoretical issues to be discussed include the contributions of domain-specific and domain-general learning mechanisms to development, the extent to which social cognition involves universal and culturally variable processes, and the relations between cognitive and social development. Topics to be covered include the development of mental-state reasoning, social inference, moral cognition, social categorization, stereotyping, and other topics of interest to participating students.                     Special Topics: System Justification Theory              PSYCH-GA.3404 Jost. 3 points              According to system justification theory, people are both consciously and unconsciously motivated to defend, bolster, and justify aspects of the societal status quo. In this seminar we will read and discuss the relevant research literature in order to critically evaluate the evidence pertaining to the theory and consider the broader implications of that evidence.                      Person Perception within Dyads              PSYCH-GA.3405 West. 3 points              This course focuses on theoretical and methodological approaches to studying dyadic and group-level person person processes. Topics covered will include person perception within a wide variety of close relationships (including romantic, friendship, and family relationships) and new acquaintance relationships (including friendships and intergroup relationships). Much of the focus will be on understanding how basic perception processes operate in dyad and group-level contexts; processes such as self perception, perceived partner perception, and metaperception. In addition, new methodological approaches to studying dyads and groups will be introduced. It is recommended although not required that students have taken at least one graduate course in statistics prior to enrolling in this course.                      Psychology and the Design of Legal Institutions              PSYCH-GA.3405 Tyler. 3 points              This joint law school-psychology seminar provides an overview of the literatures in which law and psychology interface. These include legal decision making by judges and juries; evidence; studies of legal procedures and institutions; and research on compliance and rehabilitation.                      The Relational Self              PSYCH-GA.3406 This seminar will cover research literatures on the manner in which the self develops, is defined, and is maintained in the context of interpersonal relationships. It will be a true seminar in that participants will read journal articles and chapters each week before class so we can all discuss these works in depth. Selected topics will be covered that involve relational aspects of the self, including the social-cognitive process of transference, relational schemas, attachment processes, contingencies of self-worth, self-protective processes, and relationship-protective processes, interdependent self-construal, self-standards/roles/norms, social identity, and culture.
