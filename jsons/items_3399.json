We will explore these questions in texts by Fernando Vallejo, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Alan Pauls and Sylvia Molloy, among others. (2) Figures of abandonment, of precariousness and of disavowal recur, in the most diverse ways, in a large part of recent literary fiction, reflecting directly or obliquely, depending on the specific case, radical transformations of the political and of the relation between politics and literature.
