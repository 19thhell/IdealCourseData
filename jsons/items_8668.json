The grant, part of the foundation\u2019s \u201cArchitecture and Urbanism in the Humanities\u201d program, will help fund three new NYU faculty members who will be tenured in one or more NYU humanities departments.      \u201cThe challenges of the urban present and future cannot be solved through technology, data analytics, and modeling alone,\u201d says Joy Connolly, NYU\u2019s dean for humanities. \u201cWe need to understand the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and moral complexities of the urban landscape, working within the core disciplines and concerns of the humanities.\u201d      These academic areas include the history of art and architecture; the relationship of creativity, experimentation, and the creative arts with urban life; urban history; critical analysis of urban planning and politics, as well as institutions like museums, hospitals, churches and schools; the diversity of languages and cultures concentrated in urban settings; the city\u2019s role in ancient and modern ideals of human life; literary, artistic, and musical representations of cities; and humanistic contributions to urban ecology.      \u201cNYU is well-positioned to unlock the potential of the urban humanities,\u201d adds Connolly. \u201cThe key is the recruitment of new faculty to supplement existing strengths and chart new territories for research and teaching\u2014faculty with the capacity to inspire students, to lead through research, to forge cross-disciplinary collaborations. Their broad and creative thinking will underscore the crucial role of the humanities in understanding the evolution, culture, and design of cities as well as \u2018best practices\u2019 for urban life.\u201d      The new faculty members will be important to the work of the University\u2019s Marron Institute on Cities and the Urban Environment, a new effort to advance teaching and problem-based research on the many environments that shape city life.      \u2014James Devitt                              Type: Article                                                       Search News                                       Keywords:                          Select a School             Arts and Science         College of Arts and Science         College of Dentistry         College of Nursing         Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences         Division of Libraries         Gallatin School of Individualized Study         Graduate School of Arts and Science         Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Institute of Fine Arts         Leonard N.

The grant, part of the foundation\u2019s \u201cArchitecture and Urbanism in the Humanities\u201d program, will help fund three new NYU faculty members who will be tenured in one or more NYU humanities departments.      \u201cThe challenges of the urban present and future cannot be solved through technology, data analytics, and modeling alone,\u201d says Joy Connolly, NYU\u2019s dean for humanities. \u201cWe need to understand the historical, cultural, aesthetic, and moral complexities of the urban landscape, working within the core disciplines and concerns of the humanities.\u201d      These academic areas include the history of art and architecture; the relationship of creativity, experimentation, and the creative arts with urban life; urban history; critical analysis of urban planning and politics, as well as institutions like museums, hospitals, churches and schools; the diversity of languages and cultures concentrated in urban settings; the city\u2019s role in ancient and modern ideals of human life; literary, artistic, and musical representations of cities; and humanistic contributions to urban ecology.      \u201cNYU is well-positioned to unlock the potential of the urban humanities,\u201d adds Connolly. \u201cThe key is the recruitment of new faculty to supplement existing strengths and chart new territories for research and teaching\u2014faculty with the capacity to inspire students, to lead through research, to forge cross-disciplinary collaborations. Their broad and creative thinking will underscore the crucial role of the humanities in understanding the evolution, culture, and design of cities as well as \u2018best practices\u2019 for urban life.\u201d      The new faculty members will be important to the work of the University\u2019s Marron Institute on Cities and the Urban Environment, a new effort to advance teaching and problem-based research on the many environments that shape city life.      \u2014James Devitt                              Type: Article                                                       Search News                                       Keywords:                          Select a School             Arts and Science         College of Arts and Science         College of Dentistry         College of Nursing         Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences         Division of Libraries         Gallatin School of Individualized Study         Graduate School of Arts and Science         Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Institute of Fine Arts         Leonard N.

Today's urban planners must balance development, community needs and social justice, provision of critical public services, sustainability and security.   Housed within a school of public service, rather than a school of architecture, the Master of Urban Planning program uses the broader contexts of policy, management and finance to prepare students with the critical thinking they need to succeed in urban design, land use, economic and community development, housing, and environmental and infrastructure planning.   NYU Wagner is at the forefront of the vital issues and debates about the future of cities, and the program presents myriad opportunities to obtain and practice the skills needed to confront these challenges, in New York and beyond.
