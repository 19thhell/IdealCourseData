This incorporates the University's academic mission to encourage the development of diverse programs of study and encourage dialogue between departments and schools. A diverse student body is one of the privileges that is afforded to the NYU community. Students have a unique opportunity to truly engage with and learn from others who may be different in myriad ways, including gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class, race, or ethnicity, or disability status.          The University offers a variety of services supporting the diverse groups that comprise the NYU community. Diversity education and training, multicultural programs and cultural and social justice programs are resources that are provided by the Center for Multicultural Education and Programs . Students who identify as LGBTQI thrive in a campus environment that is inclusive and supportive of student diversity in the areas of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, and can turn to the NYU Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Student Center for support, programming and community.

This incorporates the University's academic mission to encourage the development of diverse programs of study and encourage dialogue between departments and schools. A diverse student body is one of the privileges that is afforded to the NYU community. Students have a unique opportunity to truly engage with and learn from others who may be different in myriad ways, including gender, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class, race, or ethnicity, or disability status.          The University offers a variety of services supporting the diverse groups that comprise the NYU community. Diversity education and training, multicultural programs and cultural and social justice programs are resources that are provided by the Center for Multicultural Education and Programs . Students who identify as LGBTQI thrive in a campus environment that is inclusive and supportive of student diversity in the areas of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, and can turn to the NYU Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Student Center for support, programming and community.

Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           The position of minorities in the United States, an immigrant nation since its inception, remains a volatile topic of debate that touches the core of American identity. While we will review the history of minorities in America, we will focus on their status within the cultural and political framework and examine the ways that how we understand rights as either individually or communally derived informs policy decisions and shapes minority institutions. We will seek to define what \"minority\" status entails by studying how ethnicity, race, gender and religious identity, and cultural expression play out in the political sphere. Attention will then shift to minority community building - how public policies and leaders nurture or undermine minority identity, establish and sustain institutions, and create sustainable minority communities.
