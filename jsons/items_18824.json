The Science and Technology Studies curriculum falls into four broad categories: general education (40 credits), science or engineering courses (28 credits), science and technology studies courses (34 credits), and free electives (18 credits). A student can combine a core of scientific or technical courses along with the analysis of those fields from an STS perspectives.

The MCAT exam, for entrance into medical school, is expanding its scope, and students will be expected to understand more than the science of medicine.

We offer interdisciplinary BS degree programs in Integrated Digital Media (IDM) , Science and Technology Studies (STS) , and Sustainable Urban Environments (SUE) . In addition, we offer a Master of Science degree in Integrated Digital Media . These programs give students the knowledge to understand and engage with the technological and scientific society and culture in which they live and the skills that will lead to successful and rewarding careers. This program combines high-end production classes in media with research-grade investigation of new tools, techniques, and practices.     The Department of Technology, Culture and Society offers elective courses in the humanities and social sciences to meet the General Education requirement for undergraduate students.

These scholars use a variety of interdisciplinary approaches to investigate critical issues of the development, meaning, practice, and social significance of science. Their work is supported by several different schools and departments at NYU.
