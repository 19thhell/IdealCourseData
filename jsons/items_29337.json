The seminar addresses a variety of perspectives on security in a digital age, including security of information and software, computer networks, cyber-physical systems and infrastructure and will include discussions about national as well as international cyber-security law and policy. We host talks about ongoing research and initiatives and provides a platform for integrating technical, cyber and information security issues with broader societal and legal dynamics.   The seminar was launched in January 2014 and is a collaboration of the Information Law Institute , the Center on Law and Security at NYU School of Law, the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, and Steinhardt\u2019s Department of Media, Culture, and Communication . We welcome participation from all NYU faculty, research affiliates, and graduate students, as well as experts in neighboring institutions. However, attendance at meetings is generally limited to those who can commit to ongoing participation during the semester. The seminar is hosted bi-weekly, alternating between locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Please contact seminar coordinator and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Information law Institute, Joris van Hoboken if you would like to discuss joining the group or want to suggest work-in-progress that would be suitable to present.

The seminar addresses a variety of perspectives on security in a digital age, including security of information and software, computer networks, cyber-physical systems and infrastructure and will include discussions about national as well as international cyber-security law and policy. We host talks about ongoing research and initiatives and provides a platform for integrating technical, cyber and information security issues with broader societal and legal dynamics.    The seminar was launched in January 2014 and is a collaboration of the Information Law Institute , the Center on Law and Security at NYU School of Law, the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, and Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Media, Culture, and Communication . We welcome participation from all NYU faculty, research affiliates, and graduate students, as well as experts in neighboring institutions. However, attendance at meetings is generally limited to those who can commit to ongoing participation during the semester. The seminar is hosted bi-weekly, alternating between locations in Manhattan (Furman Hall, 3rd floor, Room 334 , 245 Sullivan Street) and Brooklyn ( 2 Metrotech Center, 9th floor, Room 9.007 ).

Paduano Faculty Research Symposium in Business Ethics, through the generous support of Daniel P. Paduano (MBA '69), was established in 2007 to create and develop an interdisciplinary research community, centered at NYU Stern but encompassing other NYU Faculties, dedicated to research in the field of Business Ethics, incorporating the highest levels of scholarship.    \u201cOur aim with this Symposium is to create a vibrant, self-sustaining community of scholars who are dedicated to unearthing substantive issues in business ethics and to advancing a research-based interdisciplinary understanding of these problems,\u201d said Dean Thomas Cooley.    Beginning in Fall 2007, the Paduano Fellows will participate in monthly seminars taught primarily by leading scholars in the field of business ethics. Paduano Fellows will be charged with integrating business ethics into their own teaching. Faculty from NYU departments, including economics, philosophy, psychology, neural science, sociology, and law; faculty visitors from other universities; and prominent practitioners will be invited to partake in these symposia and help strengthen the business ethics research community in New York City.
