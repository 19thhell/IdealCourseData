The Center prepares students for careers in conservation through a four-year, dual-degree program that combines practical experience in conservation with art historical, archaeological, curatorial, and scientific studies of the materials and construction of works of art. Students enroll in the MA program in art history and at the same time undertake research projects, laboratory work, and seminars in special areas of conservation, such as advanced x-ray techniques or the treatment of modern and contemporary paintings.             Students gain intensive conservation experience through advanced fieldwork and a nine-month internship. They are encouraged to obtain additional conservation experience during summer archaeological excavations or other formal work projects. The Center also provides courses in connoisseurship and technical art history for students pursuing studies in art history, archaeology, and curatorial studies, which are intended to acquaint them with the physical structure of works of art, the need for preservation, and the possibilities and limitations of conservation. Classes are taught by the Center's distinguished full and part-time faculty, many of whom serve as conservators and scientists at New York City's prestigious museums. In addition to their teaching responsibilities, the Center's faculty are active in research and other professional activities in the United States and abroad.         Course of Study       Sixty-nine (69) points in total are required for the combined MA degree in art history and conservation. Six art history courses (24 points) in three major areas are taken, including at least two seminars. The seminars cannot be in the same area of study.             Fifteen conservation courses (45 points) are taken, beginning with a two-year cycle of &ldquo;core courses&rdquo; that introduce students to the fundamentals of material science, conservation and preventive care. These core conservation courses are: Technology &amp; Structure I and II , Material Science of Art &amp; Archaeology I and II , Principles of Conservation , Instrumental Analysis I and II , and Preventive Conservation . In the second year of study, students choose to specialize in a primary area of study in paintings, objects, paper, photographs, textiles, or digital/ new media. Students wishing to specialize in library &amp; archive conservation begin this specialization during their first year of study, and must specify this interest in their application. Students may additionally declare an interest in modern and contemporary art conservation and take course work towards this specialty. Upper-level courses in each of these areas, as well as individualized instruction from conservators in the New York City area, are available..

Art: Practice and Ideas examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create &amp; reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting &amp; sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, &amp; computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, &amp; postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, &amp; technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical &amp; social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time. ARTCR-UE 0050 Modern Art and Contemporary Culture Examines the impact of modernism in both its historic &amp; contemporary relationships to culture &amp; society, through the study of painting, sculpture, architecture, &amp; the media arts from the late 1800&rsquo;s to the late 1950s. Art history with a theoretical &amp; aesthetic emphasis. Relates the art of the period to political, social, &amp; philosophical issues &amp; to current debates. Works of art are considered from slides, films, and reproductions. ART-UE 1914 Interdisciplinary Projects: Representation and Identity Open only to art majors or by permission. Prerequisite: three semesters of painting. Consideration of particular techniques allows students to broaden the range of their skills and expression. This is a studio class. Each week begins with a 20-minute discussion of current gallery or museum exhibitions that we have seen. Critiques will be every 3rd week. Students will be expected to work on their own ideas or projects. I will work with each student based on where they are in that process. Technical advice will be individual as well. Students are encourage to fully investigate their materials during this class. If there is a need for specific assignments this will be done on an individual basis. Students are encouraged to keep drawing journals and start a file of resource material with their paintings in mind. ART-UE 1391 Advanced Projects in Digital Art: \"Mind Remapping\" In this course, students will develop projects that use, critique and expand the notion and boundaries of digital media. The exploration of the mind's own processing of information will be a conceptual foundation for the course as we examine the ways in which digital tools mimic, respond to and amplify human desire. Media in the class will range from images and animation to video and music. The class will be an opportunity to both learn new tools and deepen skills already begun. Projects will be presented and discussed. ART-UE 1393 Advanced Projects in Art &amp; Media: &ldquo;Performance and Photo/Video&rdquo; This class will utilize each student&rsquo;s body in situ or in photography or video to demonstrate issues that transcend the particular aura of the individual and spread ideas into and from culture.
