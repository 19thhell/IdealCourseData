It is the original model for all of NYU Law's colloquia. The Colloquium is now convened by Liam Murphy, Samuel Scheffler, and Jeremy Waldron, two of whom will host in any given year.   Each week on Thursday a legal theorist or moral or political philosopher presents a paper to the group, which consists of students, faculty from the Law School and other departments of NYU, and faculty from other universities. The choice of subject is left to the paper\u2019s author, within the general boundaries of the Colloquium\u2019s subjects, and the discussions are therefore not connected by any structured theme for the term as a whole, though in past years certain central topics were canvassed in several weeks\u2019 discussion. The Colloquium aims, not to pursue any particular subject, but to explore new work in considerable depth and so allow students to develop their own skill in theoretical analysis. Each week\u2019s paper is posted at least a week in advance, and participants are expected to have read it.   The public sessions of the colloquium take place on Thursdays, from 4 to 7 pm, in the Lester Pollack Colloquium Room on the 9th Floor of Furman Hall, 245 Sullivan St. Visitors\u2019 papers will be posted in advance of each meeting on this page.   Students applying for credit:   Admission to the seminar is only by professor\u2019s permission. Students wishing to take the colloquium for credit should send their applications (an e-mail letter with their background and interest in the colloquium) to Professor Waldron\u2019s assistant, Lavinia Barbu, barbul@exchange.law.nyu.edu , between June 1 and August 1. Before you send your application, please check with Academic Services to see if you are eligible to apply.   Students enrolled in the Colloquium meet separately with Professor Waldron for an additional two-hour seminar on Wednesday. One hour is devoted to a review of the preceding Thursday\u2019s Colloquium discussion, and one hour in preparation for the Colloquium of the following day. Students are asked to write short papers weekly, and each student is asked to make two or more oral presentations to the seminar during the term. Each student is asked to expand one of his/her weekly papers, or oral presentations, for a final term paper.

Liam Murphy applies his inquiries into legal, moral, and political philosophy to law and legal theory.            Samuel Scheffler focuses on the area of moral and political philosophy, examining its overlap with jurisprudence.          The Law School has long had a very distinguished program in legal, moral, and political philosophy that has greatly influenced the way law schools across the country teach this complex interdisciplinary field of study. The intellectual values and programmatic innovations of its founding figures, the great philosophers Ronald Dworkin and Thomas Nagel, are evident throughout the curriculum.    Liam Murphy, Samuel Scheffler, and Jeremy Waldron are the public faces of this program, complemented by a faculty with a wide range of specialties. Professor Dale Jamieson, a distinguished environmental ethicist and the founder of NYU\u2019s Environmental Studies Program, teaches at the Law School each year. Among the full-time law faculty with strong philosophical expertise are Professors Anthony Appiah, John Ferejohn, Moshe Halbertal, Mattias Kumm, Stephen Holmes, Robert Howse, David Richards, Lewis Kornhauser, Mark Geistfeld (torts), Benedict Kingsbury (international legal theory), David Golove (foreign relations), and Amy Adler (feminist jurisprudence). The Law School has also hosted a number of distinguished legal philosophers as part of its Hauser Global Law School Program, including David Dyzenhaus, Leslie Green, J\u00e1nos Kis, Wojciech Sadurski, and, for several years, J\u00fcrgen Habermas.    NYU Law offers an array of legal philosophy courses, seminars, and guest lectures\u2014as well as the renowned Colloquium in Legal, Political and Social Philosophy \u2014that presents more choice and opportunity than other top law schools.    Students interested in legal philosophy can choose from a three-tiered structure of courses, seminars, and colloquia. The first tier consists of a series of introductory lecture courses about the following core subjects: jurisprudence or legal philosophy, moral philosophy, and political philosophy. Any given course typically addresses more than one of these subjects. This reflects NYU Law\u2019s conviction that legal, moral, and political philosophy are three aspects of what is fundamentally the one subject.    The second tier involves more specialized courses and seminars. In most years Waldron teaches a celebrated course on the rule of law. His seminar topics range widely among advanced topics in legal and political theory. Murphy has taught seminars on a wide range of topics, including some closely related to specific areas of law such as contract theory and taxation policy. The seminars, generally two hours a week with perhaps 25 students, tend to be more intimate than a lecture course, and require a high level of participation and long essays. In many academic years, Scheffler has offered a seminar in the Law School on such topics as equality and global justice.    The third tier, the Colloquium in Legal, Political and Social Philosophy , brings in distinguished speakers (half from NYU School of Law) who present papers in moral, political, and legal theory, and then are subjected to challenges and questioning from perhaps 40 or 50 faculty and students. Guests over the years have included the biggest names in the field, such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Frances Kamm, and Thomas Scanlon. In addition, the colloquium is a for-credit class for about 20 upper-year students who meet with one of the instructors separately for two hours a week to discuss and write about the same papers that were presented at the colloquium. The colloquium will next be offered by Murphy and Scheffler in Fall 2014. Thereafter it will be offered every year by some combination of Murphy, Scheffler, and Waldron.

Philosophical questions often arise in the discussion of issues in constitutional law and criminal law. There is also an important connection in the other direction: issues in ethical and political theory often depend on and are informed by issues having to do with judicial interpretation. Further, and most important, there are significant questions about the evaluation of legal institutions that cannot be approached in a serious way without a substantial background in both law and philosophy.    Admission Persons interested in the dual degree program must file separate applications to each school. The Law School and the Graduate School of Arts and Science admit applicants independently, on the basis of their usual standards. Application can be made simultaneously, but a student already enrolled in one program can also apply and be admitted to the other subsequently. Application for financial aid must also be made to the two schools separately.    Students interested in applying for a dual degree should inform both the Law School Admission Office and the Philosophy Department Director of Admissions.    Requirements The School of Law requires 82 credits of study for the J.D. However, in the Dual Degree Program, up to 12 law school credits for courses in the GSAS may be applied in satisfaction of this requirement. Courses that are cross-listed in both the School of Law and the GSAS are counted in each institution according to the listed number of credits or points. For courses that are not cross-listed, law school credits will be assigned to GSAS courses on the basis of the number of class hours. So 12 law school credits will normally correspond to six GSAS seminars (24 GSAS points).    The GSAS requires 32 points for the M.A. However, in the Dual Program, credit for up to two one-term courses in the School of Law may be applied toward the M.A. One course in the School of Law, whatever its credits, will usually count as a 4 point course in GSAS. So the two courses are normally worth 8 GSAS points. The Philosophy Department requires 24 points in courses in the Philosophy Department or taught by members of the Philosophy Department. Courses taught in the School of Law by joint or affiliated members of the Philosophy Department count toward this requirement.    Among the courses in the School of Law that count towards the M.A. are:       Contemporary Political Theory and Law    Introduction to Jurisprudence    Recent Analytical Jurisprudence    Constitutional Law    Current Constitutional Issues    First Amendment Freedoms    Colloquium on Law, Philosophy and Political Theory    Colloquium in Constitutional Theory    Among the Graduate Philosophy courses suitable to count toward the J.D. are:       Life and Death    Freedom and Moral Responsability    Political Philosophy    Contemporary Ethical Theory    Ethics: Selected Topics    Philosophy of Language    Philosophy of Science    But other courses may also be selected and each student's program is individually designed in consultation with the advisor and the Director of Graduate Studies.    The M.A. in Philosophy requires a substantial research paper of appropriate quality, which may be written either in connection with a seminar or under the individual supervision of a departmental advisor, and which must receive a grade of B+ or better. A student's academic performance and status in the program are subject to periodic review by the Department."}]}]
