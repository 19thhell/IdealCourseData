Regardless of your family's financial circumstances, paying for college will probably require a substantial commitment of your resources over the next several years. It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

Review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of your financial aid awards .   If you have been awarded Federal Direct Loans, be sure to read our instructions to secure those Direct Loans . These instructions are applicable also to returning students who may have borrowed federal loans in the past. You are encouraged to review the definitions of the loans before pursuing these or any educational loan. Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long term financial commitments, when borrowing.   Read the Financial Aid Guide , which provides essential information to accompany your NYU financial aid award package for the academic year.   Students must meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress to remain eligible for financial aid. Be sure to follow the requirements of your program/department.

Regardless of your family's financial circumstances, paying for college will probably require a substantial commitment of your resources over the next several years. It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

Review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of your financial aid awards .   If you have been awarded Federal Direct Loans, be sure to read our instructions to secure those Direct Loans . These instructions are applicable also to returning students who may have borrowed federal loans in the past. You are encouraged to review the definitions of the loans before pursuing these or any educational loan. Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long term financial commitments, when borrowing.   Read the Financial Aid Guide , which provides essential information to accompany your NYU financial aid award package for the academic year.   Students must meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress to remain eligible for financial aid. Be sure to follow the requirements of your program/department.
