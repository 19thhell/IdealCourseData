For example, learning algorithms may allow a robot to navigate an unknown environment, improving its performance as it acquires more and more data, or a voice-controlled system to improve its recognition of a person's speech after analysis of a sufficient number of samples. Machine learning techniques draw on many fundamental areas from statistics to theoretical computer science, and are used in a broad variety applications: robotics, speech analysis, finance, computer games, handwriting recognition to name just a few.    Ernest Davis studies the problem of representing commonsense knowledge: that is, the problem of taking the basic knowledge about the real world that is common to all humans; expressing it in a form that is systematic enough to be used by a computer program; and providing the program with techniques for effectively using that knowledge. The primary focus of his work is on spatial and physical reasoning (for example, a formalization of commonsense physical reasoning must capture our intuition about qualitative object behavior under gravity). Other directions of work include reasoning about knowledge, belief, plans, and goals, and their interaction with physical reasoning. Development of formal representations of this type has many potential applications in robotics, product and process design and automated training.    Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire \"skills\" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, \"deep learning\", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning.    Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.    Foster Provost studies data mining, knowledge systems, and machine learning and their alignment with business problems. He has applied advanced technologies to a variety of business problems, including fraud detection and customer contact management. His research directions include robust modeling in the face of imprecision in the business environment, and profiling/monitoring on-line activity.    David Sontag's research interests include theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and probabilistic inference, with applications to medicine, natural language processing, and information retrieval. In particular, he studies structured prediction, approximate inference in graphical models, unsupervised learning of latent variable models, and computational trade-offs between learning and inference.

According to new research published in Psychological Science , race bias also increases differences in the brain\u2019s representations of faces.   Psychological scientists Tobias Brosch of the University of Geneva and Eyal Bar-David and Elizabeth Phelps of New York University examined activity in the brain while participants looked at pictures of White and Black faces. Afterwards, participants performed a task that assessed their unconscious, or implicit, expression of race attitudes.   By examining patterns of brain activity in the fusiform face area -- a brain area involved in face perception -- the researchers were able to predict the race of the person that the participant was viewing, but only for those participants with stronger, negative implicit race attitudes.   These results suggest that the ways in which Black and White faces are represented in this brain region differ for people with a stronger, implicit race bias compared to people with less or no bias. This implies that people with stronger, negative implicit race attitudes may actually perceive Black and White faces to look more different.   Brosch notes that \u201cthese results suggest it may be possible to predict differences in implicit race bias at the individual level using brain data.\u201d Phelps, a professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Psychology and Center for Neural Science, adds, \u201cAlthough these findings may be of interest given the behavioral and societal implications of race bias, our ability to predict race bias based on brain data is relatively modest at this time.\u201d   This study was funded, in part, by grants from the National Institutes of Health (5R01MH062104), the Seaver Foundation, and the Swiss National Science Foundation.

For example, learning algorithms may allow a robot to navigate an unknown environment, improving its performance as it acquires more and more data, or a voice-controlled system to improve its recognition of a person's speech after analysis of a sufficient number of samples. Machine learning techniques draw on many fundamental areas from statistics to theoretical computer science, and are used in a broad variety applications: robotics, speech analysis, finance, computer games, handwriting recognition to name just a few.    Ernest Davis studies the problem of representing commonsense knowledge: that is, the problem of taking the basic knowledge about the real world that is common to all humans; expressing it in a form that is systematic enough to be used by a computer program; and providing the program with techniques for effectively using that knowledge. The primary focus of his work is on spatial and physical reasoning (for example, a formalization of commonsense physical reasoning must capture our intuition about qualitative object behavior under gravity). Other directions of work include reasoning about knowledge, belief, plans, and goals, and their interaction with physical reasoning. Development of formal representations of this type has many potential applications in robotics, product and process design and automated training.    Yann LeCun 's research interests include the fundamental and practical aspects of machine learning. The main goal of his research is to devise methods through which computers can extract knowledge and automatically acquire \"skills\" from massive datasets or from experience. Application of learning to perception is a central theme of his work: how can we teach machines to detect and recognize everyday objects in images, how to teach robots to navigate and avoid obstacles solely from visual input. LeCun's group works on a number of fundamental techniques (energy-based models, \"deep learning\", relational graphical models, and others) which are applied solve problems in computer vision, robotics, image and signal processing, bioinformatics, medical informatics, and economics. LeCun's group also works with the Center for Neural Science on computational models of biological learning.    Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.    Foster Provost studies data mining, knowledge systems, and machine learning and their alignment with business problems. He has applied advanced technologies to a variety of business problems, including fraud detection and customer contact management. His research directions include robust modeling in the face of imprecision in the business environment, and profiling/monitoring on-line activity.    David Sontag's research interests include theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning and probabilistic inference, with applications to medicine, natural language processing, and information retrieval. In particular, he studies structured prediction, approximate inference in graphical models, unsupervised learning of latent variable models, and computational trade-offs between learning and inference.

A     graphical model is a probabilistic model, where the     conditional dependencies between the random variables are     specified via a graph. Graphical models provide a flexible     framework for modeling large collections of variables with     complex interactions, as evidenced by their wide domain of     application, including for example machine learning,     computer vision, speech and computational biology. This     course will provide a comprehensive survey of learning and     inference methods in graphical models.

However, when being stuck on a problem, I encourage     you to collaborate with other students in the class, subject    to the following rules:               You may discuss a problem with any student in this     class, and work together on solving it. This can involve     brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem, going     together through possible solutions, but should not      involve one student telling another a complete solution.                Once you solve the homework, you must write up      your solutions on your own , without looking at     other people's write-ups or giving your write-up to     others.                In your solution for each problem, you must write      down the names of any person with whom you     discussed it. This will not affect your grade.                Do not consult solution manuals or other people's     solutions from similar courses.           Late submission policy : During the    semester you are allowed at most two extensions on the    homework assignment. Each extension is for at most 48 hours    and carries a penalty of 25% off your assignment."}]}]
