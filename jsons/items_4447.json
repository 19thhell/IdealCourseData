The seminar will focus on the literary representation of the most pressing issue at the heart of Israel\u2019s existence -- the diverging attitudes toward the concepts of peace and war, or to conflict-resolution through the exercise of violence more generally. The corpus will include major works in Israeli literature \u2013 mostly fiction but some film and poetry as well \u2013 from its inception in pre-state Palestine to the present. Issues to be raised: Do literary representations reflect historical realities or do they constructthem? What role do sex/gender differences play in shaping the division between pacifists and their opponents? How does trauma \u2013 both personal and collective, past and present \u2013 impact the adherence to one position or another? What psycho-political circumstances have determined the glorification of military heroism and its decline? Finally, what does religion have to do with all this? Readings include: prose by S. Y. Agnon, S. Yizhar, Moshe Shamir, Shulamit Hareven, G. Shoham, A.B Yehoshua, Amos Oz, David Grossman, Ron Leshem; poetry by Yitzhak Lamdan, Haim Guri, Yehuda Amichai, Daliah Rvikovitch, Meir Wieselteir, Yizhak Laor; films on Lebanon War; critical studies related to the issues listed above.
