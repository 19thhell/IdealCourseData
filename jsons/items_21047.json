Located in a school of public service rather than in a medical or public health school, our program crosses traditional boundaries, linking management, finance, policy, and providing students with the cutting-edge concepts and skills needed to shape the future of health policy and management.   Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.

Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.
