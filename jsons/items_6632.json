Description       The idea of an archive\u2014a place where historical materials are preserved\u2014has come under scrutiny on the basis of its contents and context. Academics have asked: What defines an archive? Who or what controls an archive? How do we access these materials? What relationship do these records have to our ideas of history? How do physical archives relate to digital repositories? This course will conside the archive both as a space and as a concept and ask students to explore what role the archive plays in research. In our class, we will focus on the visual archive. Over the past decade, New York City institutions have begun to embrace radical ephemera; we see this in new collections like Barnard Zine Collection (2003), NYU's Riot Grrrl Collection (2009), and Brooklyn College Library's Zine Collection (2011). Through site visits and presentations by those who work with/in archives, students will learn how to conduct archival research while considering the question of which materials and experiences get archived. Documenting their own research process, students will create their own visual archive and contribute field notes to a class website. They will write a series of short essays in preparation for a research paper that examines a subject and its archival context. Readings may include works by Alison Bechdel, Ann Cvetkovich, Lisa Darms, Angela Davis, Jacques Derrida, Kate Eichhorn, Michel Foucault, and Alison Piepmeier.

Description       The idea of an archive\u2014a place where historical materials are preserved\u2014has come under scrutiny on the basis of its contents and context. Academics have asked: What defines an archive? Who or what controls an archive? How do we access these materials? What relationship do these records have to our ideas of history? How do physical archives relate to digital repositories? This course will conside the archive both as a space and as a concept and ask students to explore what role the archive plays in research. In our class, we will focus on the visual archive. Over the past decade, New York City institutions have begun to embrace radical ephemera; we see this in new collections like Barnard Zine Collection (2003), NYU's Riot Grrrl Collection (2009), and Brooklyn College Library's Zine Collection (2011). Through site visits and presentations by those who work with/in archives, students will learn how to conduct archival research while considering the question of which materials and experiences get archived. Documenting their own research process, students will create their own visual archive and contribute field notes to a class website. They will write a series of short essays in preparation for a research paper that examines a subject and its archival context. Readings may include works by Alison Bechdel, Ann Cvetkovich, Lisa Darms, Angela Davis, Jacques Derrida, Kate Eichhorn, Michel Foucault, and Alison Piepmeier.

July 21, 2014  Harshit Sanghvi     Leave a comment                  This was a research seminar\u00a0on the idea and usage of a visual archive. The instructor used the site as a portal to not only keep students on top of their coursework, but also wider developments related to visual archives.

Digital Reflection #6         The Interference of a Digital World          April 23, 2014  Harshit Sanghvi     3 Comments                  The Interference Archives in Gowanus, Brooklyn has definitely proved itself to be the best visit we have made in this course. While it is sad to be writing a final blogpost, I&#8217;m glad its on out greatest trip! Ever since I became a little more well-versed in archival definitions and how to approach different archives, I know to instantly analyze \u00a03 things: space, relevance, and importance. Simply stepping into the archives was an experience within itself. The warehouse was large yet the archives only inhibited a small room for storage and viewing and another small room for displays. The volunteers were inviting and very excited to see us as well. This space could be easily classified as welcoming, unorthodox, and kind of &#8220;underground&#8221;. The relevance was also great because activism is something that continually exists and never ceases. Right now, activism is at a high, and this archive has materials relevant to our time period. The importance of the archive echoes the relevance and the fact that the archive collects all forms of activist material from all over furthers the importance it has to everyone.      In relation to our readings, however, the Interference archive has a force to be reckoned with in digital media. As the New York Times article alongside the work of Beer and Burrows points out, digital media such as Pinterest, Tumblr, Facebook, and more are seemingly contending against physical archives as the go-to source for photo and textual collections. These works outline challenges the digital programs have in becoming as respected and effective as physical ones. Something that came to my attention is funding! Although digital media encounters conceptual issues, they typically have a lot to spare when it comes to money for upkeep. Lesser known physical archives, like the Interference Archive, on the other hand barely get good enough funding to support a mission as broad as theirs. This is a factor that deserves attention and perhaps we should ask ourselves, should we donate to archives like these so they can stay in the battle against digital archives?   &#8212;   In terms of my personal agenda, all is going well. My research is now mainly complete and I am working on the first draft of my final assignment. The major issue I am having right now is factoring in Prof. Galvan&#8217;s comments about how I should refrain from simply pitting the physical from the digital archives in the &#8220;slippery&#8221; slope of trustworthiness. I need to find a way to shift my secondary sources and their main ideas of defining a difference between physical and digital sources and keep trustworthiness on the back-burner. I am excited to get started on this work but I am a little scared to start. I think I need to first outline some of the main points my secondary sources make, pick the cream of the crop, then make a master outline that guides me in writing exactly what I need to prove my thesis. This will hopefully be one of the best writing assignments I have done thus far!        Carina Chocano David Beer Facebook interference archive New York Times No more Trustworthiness!

I know that when I visited the interference archive last weekend with Dan, I was somewhere that prided itself in not being the same as the rest. The material held within the space and the way it was being housed was a very nice surprise to me! Me, being the person whose interested in clothing, went to straight to the t-shirt section where I was astonished at the method in which these t-shirts were being kept. They were neatly folded with a cardboard square as support which was then tightly wrapped in a sort of zip lock plastic baggy. I kept thinking of the NYU archives and the t-shirts we saw there which were by no means being preserved in the same efficient way as they were at the Interference Archive.   Something else I really appreciated was the fact that this archive, much like the Lesbian Herstory Archive, prides itself in representing those whose voices would remain unheard were it not for dedicated individuals like the ones at the Interference Archive. They seek to understand and stand behind the brave and silent few who fight the social system and probably wouldn&#8217;t be covered by mainstream media, thus preventing their identity and story for justice from being heard by the world. One thing I found to be very interesting was the amount of material there was about the Zapatistas, a movement in Chiapas, Mexico which is not currently its very own functioning city state. These and many other materials validated my belief that this archive was innovative and special.        different diversity innovation Mexico revolt revolution standout voiceless                   Digital Reflection #6         Comm(unity)          April 23, 2014  Harshit Sanghvi     5 Comments                  Like most of the class, I really liked the openness and organization of Interference. Though I&#8217;d been to Interference a few times already, I had always gone to check out the exhibits and rarely looked at the actual archive. The really interesting thing about Interference is how they archive the most ephemeral of materials, the art that comes out of protests and movements. I like the idea of preserving the art or the culture of a movement because art has historically been institutionalized and has a reputation for being exclusive and elitist (the Whitney Biennial as a relevant and current example). Keeping these materials and placing them within a larger repository that is so open and accessible to the public really goes hand in hand with the idea of reclaiming art for the people and the community, which these movements are primarily concerned with. Connecting with the idea of community, I find that Interference is really that space that tries actively to create a community. They leave out free &#8220;anarchist&#8221; materials often produced by organizations created for the people and the community, like the instruction manual on how to create a Book Shield as done by the CUNY protesters for freeing education. They also host a number of events coinciding with their ongoing exhibits, and they were really active during the Serve the People exhibit. I attended a number of events during the exhibit and was struck by the number of people who attended, as well as who was actually coming. I was able to meet and make the acquaintance of a number of activists at the time, including three women who were originally part of Asian Women United, as well as unofficial photographer of the movement Corky Lee. I also met a number of budding activists around my age, two of them who actually went to the same high school as I did. This exhibit really couldn&#8217;t have been hosted in many other galleries/ museums/ archives, and it was primarily because of Interference&#8217;s mission and their space that allowed this collision of worlds and bridging of past and present.

I could see this both at the Lesbian Herstory archive and at the\u00a0Interference Archive. Everything at the Lesbian Herstory Archive feels quite homely, probably because it&#8217;s housed in an actual brownstone with a person living in it. It would make sense that \u00a0ephemera held within archive are mostly incredibly personal things, like diaries and letters. Interference&#8217;s ephemera is posters and flyers, mostly revolutionary in nature. It would make sense then that the archive would be essentially an archive for the people, \u00a0allowing anyone access with out having to schedule appointment. It is also entirely run by volunteers. Even the physical appearance of the archive seemed intertwined with its Ephemera. The archive is large and open, the walls are covered with art, and people mingle, looking at the art at their own pace. It feels like how the revolutionaries who created the posters would design an archive; peaceful and open to all. The question now becomes does the ephemera\u00a0 effect the archive, or does the archive effect the ephemera? Do we choose places related to what we archive? Or does what we archive effect the places around it? Either way there is a bond between ephemera \u00a0and the archive, and one can not exist with out the other.        archive ephemera interference archive Lesbian Herstory Archive       Posts navigation          1   2   &hellip;   12   Next &rarr;                  Twitter Feed Placeholder     This isn't working yet, because Jetpack is broken.
