Living in NYU Paris assigned housing is a condition of enrollment. All students will complete an online housing application where they will express their interest in the type of housing assignment that is preferred. Housing assignments will be made based on availability of each housing type and may take into consideration if the student is enrolled in the Program II (Francophone) coursework or not. Keep in mind that assignments may not be the top preference but a placement in NYU approved housing is guaranteed. Housing options include:     Residence Montsouris     Homestays   Apartments                                           Housing Assignments            Online Housing Application   During the pre-departure process the NYU Paris adviser will direct you to an online housing application. The application will allow you to submit your preference for an assignment in the type of housing that is available. NYU Paris housing staff will review your responses to questions from the application, consider your program of study, and also the availability of styles of housing before making assignments.   Placement   Once housing assignments are finalized, typically about two weeks before arrival in Paris, NYU Paris will inform students via email of their assignment.   Housing Check-in and Payment   Residence Montsouris or R\u00e9publique Apartments: If you are assigned to live in the Montsouris student residence, or in the R\u00e9publique apartments, you will be instructed to go directly to the building from the airport to check in. Housing charges will appear on the NYU Bursar bill in US dollars. Scholarships and aid awards in excess of tuition and fees will credit against the cost of housing. Payments are to be made to the University Bursar in the e-suite online payment tool.   Homestay or Privately Owned Apartment: If you are assigned to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment, you will be informed of an address of a hotel where you should proceed from the airport. The cost of the hotel is paid for by NYU on your behalf. Within a few days of your arrival, you will meet individually with a member of the NYU Paris staff to receive the exact address of your housing assignment. You will be given an appointment to meet your French host or to see your apartment. This assignment is final and cannot be changed. (Note: housing details will NOT be communicated to students before this occasion). Before moving in, you will be required to complete a written agreement with your landlord concerning rent, utilities, security deposit, payment methods accepted by your landlord, and the length of your stay.   Note regarding security deposits: In accordance with French law, you will be required upon move-in to give a security deposit equivalent to one month\u2019s rent and the first month's rent in its entirety. Please plan to have access to this amount of funds upon arrival. Note: French bank accounts will not yet be available when you move in. You will be advised as to how to exchange traveler's checks during orientation.                NYU Paris Housing FAQ's:       Students who live in the Montsouris residence will live with other students enrolled at NYU Paris, have kitchen and bathroom facilities in the room, and will receive support from live-in NYU student resident assistants. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.&amp;nbsp;   The R\u00e9publique building offers single studios to NYU students but the majority of residents are local French or international students enrolled in the French university system. The apartments have equipped kitchenettes and bathrooms. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.     Students who live in homestays and privately owned apartments must understand that NYU does not control these units. Rather, NYU Paris puts students in contact with independent Parisian landlords, and hosts whom have rented to NYU students in the past and are willing to rent their apartments or rooms on a short-term basis. NYU Paris has no financial relationship with landlords/home owners. NYU Paris receives no financial gain in exchange.   The NYU Paris housing coordinator serves as an intermediary between the residence manager, property owners, and students. All accommodations have been visited and approved by NYU Paris staff.   Homestays and privately owned apartments are located in neighborhoods in all twenty arrondissements of Paris and its immediate suburbs. Average commute time from these student housing types to the NYU Paris academic center and Parisian universities ranges from 30 to 50 minutes.   There is no &quot;average&quot; room. Every apartment, homestay, etc. differs in size and prices range from $600 to $1,400 or more per student per month.   According to French law, rent for all months in which a unit is occupied is due in its entirety and landlords may legally keep security deposits for up to two months after the student vacates the housing. The charge for living in Montsouris or the R\u00e9publique apartments is constant for fall and spring semester, whereas the cost to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment is greater in the spring semester due to the extra length of the spring semester academic calendar.

For each point taken in excess of 18 points in a semester, there is an additional charge per point.   Non-NYU Students   If your college or university has a partnership with NYU Global Academic Programs the cost of tuition may be less than    the posted figures. Inquire with your study abroad office to find out if there is a partnership with NYU.              Lodging   Once offered admission to the program, students are required to complete an on-line housing questionnaire indicating the type of lodging preferred. Many housing choices are offered. You can request a housing placement made for you by NYU Paris staff or find a place in Paris to live on your own. If you request a housing placement through NYU Paris, your options are a room with a French host, a single studio apartment/studette, or a shared apartment with other NYU Paris program students. During the 40 years that NYU Paris has existed, a solid network of host families and landlords who receive students has been built.     Housing placements are throughout the various neighborhoods of Paris, and are typically within a 45-minute commute from the NYU Center, which is in the upscale 16th arrondissement. The public transportation system in Paris is extremely reliable and easy to navigate. There are two Metro stops near the NYU Paris Academic Center.     With the exception of the R\u00e9publique student residence, housing costs are separate from tuition and fees paid to New York University, and must be paid in local currency directly to Parisian landlords. Please know that if you request a housing placement through NYU Paris, you will not receive details until you arrive in Paris. Your first several days will be spent in temporary housing at a conference center where you will undergo orientation activities as a group. A cancelation fee may be assessed if a student's written request to cancel the housing license be approved.     Meals   Some students choose the French host family housing option in which certain meals are provided. However, most students will prepare meals in their residences and/or dine in local restaurants. Very reasonably priced restaurants can be found outside of the main tourist areas.   Miscellaneous   Study abroad costs include visa application fees, local transportation, laundry, telephone, utilities, and some independent travel. With the exception of tuition, all costs are estimated and may vary depending on each student's budget.   In addition, student insurance (health and accident) is mandatory and will vary according to individual policies.   Excursions/Cultural Activities   Some excursions and cultural activities are included in tuition costs.                               Required Expenses  Total (per semester)   $27,085 - $31,632   Undergraduate Tuition &amp; Fees*  $23,085  Lodging (estimated)   $4,000 - $8,547      Additional Expenses  Total $4,932 - $5,632   Meals $2,100 - $2,600  Round-Trip Airfare $1,000 - $1,200  Monthly Metro (x4) $332  Miscellaneous $1000                *The rates listed are for the 2014-2015 academic year. NYU students pay their individual school tuition, which may differ by college.   Disclaimer: The Board of Trustees of New York University reserves the right to alter the schedule of fees without notice.              ***For a review of prices for typical items you may purchase while abroad, take a look at this updated list .***            Billing   NYU\u2019s Electronic billing system is the official means of generating tuition bills for all enrolled students. Within a few weeks of registering for classes, students (with the exception of visiting students whose home schools choose to bill them directly for their term at NYU) will receive a message at their official NYU e-mail address notifying them that a bill for tuition, fees, and housing is now available.   Please visit the NYU Bursar Web-site for details about the E-bill process.                  Global Travel Assistance   Provided at no additional cost to the student, this service provides assistance through one of the world's largest providers of medical and security evacuation as well as general travel aid (e.g., lost document assistance). This company provides 24-hour global services with the help of our site staff to our students abroad.                                                        NYU Centers Abroad...

Living in NYU Paris assigned housing is a condition of enrollment. All students will complete an online housing application where they will express their interest in the type of housing assignment that is preferred. Housing assignments will be made based on availability of each housing type and may take into consideration if the student is enrolled in the Program II (Francophone) coursework or not. Keep in mind that assignments may not be the top preference but a placement in NYU approved housing is guaranteed. Housing options include:     Residence Montsouris     Homestays   Apartments                                           Housing Assignments            Online Housing Application   During the pre-departure process the NYU Paris adviser will direct you to an online housing application. The application will allow you to submit your preference for an assignment in the type of housing that is available. NYU Paris housing staff will review your responses to questions from the application, consider your program of study, and also the availability of styles of housing before making assignments.   Placement   Once housing assignments are finalized, typically about two weeks before arrival in Paris, NYU Paris will inform students via email of their assignment.   Housing Check-in and Payment   Residence Montsouris or R\u00e9publique Apartments: If you are assigned to live in the Montsouris student residence, or in the R\u00e9publique apartments, you will be instructed to go directly to the building from the airport to check in. Housing charges will appear on the NYU Bursar bill in US dollars. Scholarships and aid awards in excess of tuition and fees will credit against the cost of housing. Payments are to be made to the University Bursar in the e-suite online payment tool.   Homestay or Privately Owned Apartment: If you are assigned to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment, you will be informed of an address of a hotel where you should proceed from the airport. The cost of the hotel is paid for by NYU on your behalf. Within a few days of your arrival, you will meet individually with a member of the NYU Paris staff to receive the exact address of your housing assignment. You will be given an appointment to meet your French host or to see your apartment. This assignment is final and cannot be changed. (Note: housing details will NOT be communicated to students before this occasion). Before moving in, you will be required to complete a written agreement with your landlord concerning rent, utilities, security deposit, payment methods accepted by your landlord, and the length of your stay.   Note regarding security deposits: In accordance with French law, you will be required upon move-in to give a security deposit equivalent to one month\u2019s rent and the first month's rent in its entirety. Please plan to have access to this amount of funds upon arrival. Note: French bank accounts will not yet be available when you move in. You will be advised as to how to exchange traveler's checks during orientation.                NYU Paris Housing FAQ's:       Students who live in the Montsouris residence will live with other students enrolled at NYU Paris, have kitchen and bathroom facilities in the room, and will receive support from live-in NYU student resident assistants. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.&amp;nbsp;   The R\u00e9publique building offers single studios to NYU students but the majority of residents are local French or international students enrolled in the French university system. The apartments have equipped kitchenettes and bathrooms. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.     Students who live in homestays and privately owned apartments must understand that NYU does not control these units. Rather, NYU Paris puts students in contact with independent Parisian landlords, and hosts whom have rented to NYU students in the past and are willing to rent their apartments or rooms on a short-term basis. NYU Paris has no financial relationship with landlords/home owners. NYU Paris receives no financial gain in exchange.   The NYU Paris housing coordinator serves as an intermediary between the residence manager, property owners, and students. All accommodations have been visited and approved by NYU Paris staff.   Homestays and privately owned apartments are located in neighborhoods in all twenty arrondissements of Paris and its immediate suburbs. Average commute time from these student housing types to the NYU Paris academic center and Parisian universities ranges from 30 to 50 minutes.   There is no &quot;average&quot; room. Every apartment, homestay, etc. differs in size and prices range from $600 to $1,400 or more per student per month.   According to French law, rent for all months in which a unit is occupied is due in its entirety and landlords may legally keep security deposits for up to two months after the student vacates the housing. The charge for living in Montsouris or the R\u00e9publique apartments is constant for fall and spring semester, whereas the cost to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment is greater in the spring semester due to the extra length of the spring semester academic calendar.

If you request a housing placement through NYU Paris, your options are a room with a French host, a single studio apartment/studette, or a shared apartment with other NYU Paris program students. During the 40 years that NYU Paris has existed, a solid network of host families and landlords who receive students has been built.     Housing placements are throughout the various neighborhoods of Paris, and are typically within a 45-minute commute from the NYU Center, which is in the upscale 16th arrondissement. The public transportation system in Paris is extremely reliable and easy to navigate. There are two Metro stops near the NYU Paris Academic Center.     With the exception of the R\u00e9publique student residence, housing costs are separate from tuition and fees paid to New York University, and must be paid in local currency directly to Parisian landlords. Please know that if you request a housing placement through NYU Paris, you will not receive details until you arrive in Paris. Your first several days will be spent in temporary housing at a conference center where you will undergo orientation activities as a group. A cancelation fee may be assessed if a student's written request to cancel the housing license be approved.     Meals   Some students choose the French host family housing option in which certain meals are provided. However, most students will prepare meals in their residences and/or dine in local restaurants. Very reasonably priced restaurants can be found outside of the main tourist areas.   Miscellaneous   Study abroad costs include visa application fees, local transportation, laundry, telephone, utilities, and some independent travel. With the exception of tuition, all costs are estimated and may vary depending on each student's budget.   In addition, student insurance (health and accident) is mandatory and will vary according to individual policies.   Excursions/Cultural Activities   Some excursions and cultural activities are included in tuition costs.                               Required Expenses  Total (per semester)   $27,085 - $31,632   Undergraduate Tuition &amp; Fees*  $23,085  Lodging (estimated)   $4,000 - $8,547      Additional Expenses  Total $4,932 - $5,632   Meals $2,100 - $2,600  Round-Trip Airfare $1,000 - $1,200  Monthly Metro (x4) $332  Miscellaneous $1000                *The rates listed are for the 2014-2015 academic year. NYU students pay their individual school tuition, which may differ by college.   Disclaimer: The Board of Trustees of New York University reserves the right to alter the schedule of fees without notice.              ***For a review of prices for typical items you may purchase while abroad, take a look at this updated list .***            Billing   NYU\u2019s Electronic billing system is the official means of generating tuition bills for all enrolled students. Within a few weeks of registering for classes, students (with the exception of visiting students whose home schools choose to bill them directly for their term at NYU) will receive a message at their official NYU e-mail address notifying them that a bill for tuition, fees, and housing is now available.   Please visit the NYU Bursar Web-site for details about the E-bill process.                  Global Travel Assistance   Provided at no additional cost to the student, this service provides assistance through one of the world's largest providers of medical and security evacuation as well as general travel aid (e.g., lost document assistance). This company provides 24-hour global services with the help of our site staff to our students abroad.                                                        NYU Centers Abroad...

However you are not limited to taking the courses listed on this page. You should use this page, in additional to Sciences Po\u2019s course listings , to help you prepare a preliminary list and backup list of courses you want to take abroad.    Please note: You can take a maximum of two classes per major/concentration during your IBEX semester. Also, Accounting courses cannot be taken abroad for credit toward the Accounting or CPA majors/concentrations.    There is no guarantee that the courses listed here will be offered during the specific semester you study abroad. Once Sciences Po publishes its confirmed courses for the semester you will be attending, you can revise your list as needed based on what is actually being offered. If you see a course on Sciences Po\u2019s website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval. If the course is approved you will be notified and it will be added to the list of courses below. If a course is already listed here as approved, it does not need to be reviewed or approved again.     *Please note: As of AY14/15 Sciences Po is migrating its limited business courses to its Reims campus. Stern students wishing to take courses at Sciences Po in Paris should be prepared to take economics or elective courses only                                                           Fall 2014                                                 Course Title Abroad      NYU Credits      Course Equivalent at NYU              ASPO 1405A Foundations of Moral and Political Thought      5      Elective (CAS)              BAFF 1600A Strategic Studies      3      Elective (CAS)              BAFF 1605A Introduction to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict      3      Elective (CAS)              BDBA 4290A Theatres of Commitment      3      Elective (CAS)              BECO 1540A International Trade and Globalisation      3      ECON-UB 11 Economics of Global Business              CCIV 1580 La Gastronomie \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise      3      Elective (CAS)              DAFF 2220A Boundaries in Europe: Identities, Cultures and Society      3      Elective (CAS)              DDRO 1750A Intro to Intellectual Property Law      3      Elective (CAS)              DECO 1950A Gender and Development      3      Elective (CAS)              DECO 1955A World Poverty      3      Elective (CAS)              DHIS 2040A A Continent of Peace      3      Elective (CAS)              DHUM 1045A Age of the Avant-Garde: Paris      3      Elective (CAS)              DHUM 1205A Whiteness in America      3      Elective (CAS)              LFRA 5301 Fran\u00e7ais moyen/fort (niv.3)      3      Elective (CAS)                                            Fall 2013                                                 Course Title Abroad      NYU Credits      Course Equivalent at NYU              AECO 1325A Development Economics      5      Advanced Economics Elective PLUS 2 Elective credits (Stern)              AECO 1345A Economics in the European Union      5      Advanced Economics Elective PLUS 2 Elective credits (Stern)              BECO 1540A International Trade and Globalisation      3      ECON-UB 11 Economics of Global Business              BECO 1600 Central Banking      3      Elective (Stern)              BHUM 1250A From Paris to New York : The Roman Noir of the 1950s      3      Elective (CAS)              BHUM 1255A Pushing the Limits of Classical Cinema      3      Elective (CAS)              BSPO 1255A Social Policies in Europe      3      Elective (CAS)              BSPO 1615 Sciences de la paix, sciences du conflit: sortir de la violence politique      3      Elective (CAS)              CDRO 1255 Les Representations du Droit      3      Elective (CAS)              DECO 1260A Business of Wine in France      3      Elective (CAS)              DECO 1565A International Economic Negotiation      3      Elective (Stern)              DECO 1760A Risks in Financial Markets      3      Elective (Stern)              DECO 1790A Competition Policy      3      Elective (Stern)              DECO 1805A Economic Policies in Emerging Market Countries: Macroeconomics of Development      3      Advanced Economics Elective              DHUM 1045A Age of Avant Garde in Paris      3      Elective (CAS)              DSPO 2085A Governing Sustainable Cities      3      Elective (CAS)              LESP 5301 04 Espagnol moyen/fort (Niveau 3)      3      Elective (CAS)              LFRA 50D0 Francais Debutant (Niveau 0)      3      Elective (CAS)              LFRA 5401 Francais Fort (Niveau 4)      3      Elective (CAS)                                            Fall 2012                                                      Course Title Abroad                NYU Credits                Course Equivalent at NYU                   BECO 1480A International Macroeconomics and Finance      3      ECON-UB 11 Economics of Global Business              BECO 1540A International Trade and Globalisation      3      ECON-UB 11 Economics of Global Business              BECO 1565A European Integration      3      Advanced Economics Elective              CECO 1585 Grand d\u00e9bats de politique \u00e9conomique      3      French Elective      (department consent required)              DECO 1255A Cross-Cultural Management      3      MGMT-UB 4 International Business Management              DECO 1260A - The World of Wine in France      3      Elective (CAS)              DECO1740A Marketing &amp;
