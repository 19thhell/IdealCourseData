Also, about the names of each orbit. We also learned about the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION . It takes the space station about 90 minutes to just go around the EARTH once. \u00a0That way it&#8217;s able to outrun the EARTH and stay in orbit. \u00a0We also kept building with the LEGOs. Today i helped build the\u00a0 NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS , it wasn&#8217;t easy building it but after some work we came up with some good ideas and finally finished it. It still needs some final adjustments, but those will be made next time we work on the city.

Satellites and the Way They Orbit                            Leave a reply                             Today we learned about space and wireless communications. We learned about satellites and the way they orbit. We spent a lot of time discussing Newton&#8217;s laws. We also discussed ellipses and the patterns planets make when they orbit. Towards the end of the day, we finished all of our major buildings. The nuclear plant I was working on finally got finished and it looks great.

Traffic Engineering: An Idea                            Leave a reply                             Today in class we had a lecture on traffic engineering. During our activity we brainstormed ideas for traffic engineering in a smart city. One of my ideas was W.T.T.I. (Wireless Telecommunication Transportation Infrastructure.) In simple terms all devices of traffic infrastructure will have a built in microchip, upon construction. Therefore, transportation infrastructure can interact in a way to make local travel in a more safe and efficient manner. For example; on a two way street, the first side is congested, (with a light flashed red),and the other side of the street has no cars coming. The side of the street with no cars coming has the lights flashed &#8220;green.&#8221; The &#8220;intelligent&#8221; street lights will pick up on the fact there are no cars coming, (and none to come anytime soon.) It will send a message to the red light where the L.O.S (Level of Service) is terrible. That light, recognizing the problem at end, will turn green expediting local travel, and letting people get from point A to point B in the safest way possible making many people satisfied and happy. This idea can revolutionize our urban infrastructure making local travel in New York City a whole lot better.
