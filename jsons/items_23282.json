The NYU School of Professional Studies of which McGhee is a unit, also has developed numerous partnerships around the world with institutions of higher learning, corporations, and nonprofit organizations that expand research opportunities and provide the basis for a continuous exchange of ideas among faculty members and students on a global basis. As a McGhee student, we encourage you to take advantage of our study abroad opportunities.   New York University operates study abroad programs in many countries around the world. For more information, visit www.nyu.edu/studyabroad . If you are interested in taking McGhee's travel and study abroad courses, or you want to apply to one of the NYU study abroad programs, please consult with your advisor.           Study Abroad Scholarships   Etta Kallman Memorial Scholarship  McGhee students who have completed their first semester of study are eligible to apply for the Etta Kallman Memorial Scholarship. This $1,000 scholarship was established to provide financial assistance for short-term travel/study abroad for adults who, because of financial constraints and/or family and work conflicts, must usually forgo this enriching experience.
