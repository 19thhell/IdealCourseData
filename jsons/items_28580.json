Key Facts     24.3% of NYU students are overweight, of which 6.0% are obese. 1   Physical inactivity is a primary contributor to one-third of the adult population\u2019s being  overweight or obese. 26     The incidence of obesity in the U.S. college-aged population has increased from 12% in 1991 to 36% in 2004. 21   Only 45% of adults get the recommended 30 minutes of physical activity on 5 or more days per week, and adolescents are similarly inactive. 9   81 to 85% of adults continue the same physical activity patterns that they establish during their senior year of college. 12   An estimated 40 to 45% of college students engage in fitness activities regularly (\u22653 days/week). 30,31   Non-exercising adults are more likely to be absent from work for more than 7 days when  compared to those exercising at least once per week. 16   Students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher are three times more likely to exercise than those with lower grades. 25                                           Recommendations     Implement point-of-decision prompts and motivational signage around campus to encourage stairwell use, walking, and other self-powered transportation.  Point-of-decision prompts are visual cues used to guide individuals in adopting healthy behaviors. These prompts serve to integrate physical activity into daily living, create a climate where choices to be active are encouraged, and increase awareness about the benefits of physical activity. 7 This strategy is appropriate for diverse populations and settings and has proven effective in eliciting desired active living behaviors. 9 Placing point-of-decision prompts at locations such as elevator banks, stairwells, and NYU trolley stops will help students recognize cues and opportunities for physical activity. 9     Improve existing on-campus exercise facilities.  NYU\u2019s Coles Sports Center and Palladium Athletic Facility accommodate 1 million students, faculty, staff, and alumni visits to the facilities each year, supervise over 1,200 students playing on club sports and intramural teams, and enroll more than 8,000 NYU community members in 235+ recreation courses. 27 Recognizing the importance of fitness centers, NYU will continue to improve its existing on-campus exercise facilities to meet the evolving needs of the NYU community. 12 Many factors have been shown to impact fitness center utilization, including effective signage and suitable information about the facilities available on campus, accessibility and variety of exercise equipment, flexible class options and schedules, and aesthetic attributes such as air conditioning, lockers, or media. 10,12 NYU will continue to implement innovative solutions to make its exercise facilities and resources accessible and appealing.       Develop and implement tools to support physical fitness.  Tools such as pedometers and interactive technologies have been shown to be effective in helping students reach and maintain their physical activity goals. Devices to support physical activity can be personal items, which reflect individual preferences, allow for self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and incremental goal-setting. 11 Technology-based resources in particular can allow for individually tailored assistance or advice based on factors such as an individual\u2019s specific interests, preferences, and readiness for change. 8,9       Improve awareness of and access to non-gym-based physical activity opportunities.  Gym-based exercise may not be the preferred method of physical activity for some students because of location, time, perceived cost, motivation, or student comfort. 19,20 NYU and the surrounding community offer a wealth of resources to accommodate the spectrum of students\u2019 needs and preferences. Living an active lifestyle by integrating physical activity into an individual\u2019s daily routine can be an effective way to increase personal fitness. 5,6,9 Expanding structured programs for self-powered transportation, building partnerships with local vendors, and using technology-based methods increase the variety of and access to opportunities for physical activity .5,6,9,17       Expand NYU organized physical activity opportunities such as peer support, classes, and extracurricular clubs.   Building, strengthening, and maintaining social networks are effective strategies for increasing physical activity and improving overall physical fitness. 4 The use of peer support and interactive social groups, such as classes and clubs, can increase engagement in physical activity by giving students the opportunity to be connected to other students and staff members, thereby enabling them to monitor their progress and encouraging them to continue their activities. 5 These opportunities for physical activity can also reduce or eliminate some of the barriers to physical activity, such as safety concerns and lack of motivation. 9       Develop physical activity-focused special events.  Involvement in university life is an important and vital aspect of a student\u2019s collegiate career; special events, such as competitions and challenges, can be an effective method for getting students focused on and excited about participating in health-related activities, and for promoting physical activity. 18,32 Creating University-wide events focused throughout the academic school year will not only engage students individually but can also cultivate social norms and traditions around physical activity.       Reduce barriers to safe physical activity.  Nationally, safety concerns are a leading barrier to participating in physical activity. 2,5 Students are more likely to live active lifestyles if they feel safe and comfortable in their surroundings.6 Educating students about personal safety precautions and providing access to safety equipment may help reduce barriers to exercising outdoors.6 Such precautions include: being aware of their surroundings; exercising with a partner in a well-lit area or during daytime hours; or learning self-defense techniques. 2       Strengthen the integration of physical activity with the NYU academic curriculum.  Physical activity has been shown to enhance brain function and improve on-task behavior during academic instruction time. 3,13 NYU can integrate physical activity with learning by: scheduling physical activity breaks during instruction time, creating opportunities for students to be active through non-sedentary learning activities, providing institutional recognition for students\u2019 co-curricular fitness skills and achievements throughout their tenure at NYU, and increasing for-credit physical activity-based courses. 3,12,14,15 By providing a learning environment in which physical activity is incorporated, NYU has the potential to impact students\u2019 short- and long-term physical activity behaviors, and to maximize students\u2019 learning during academic activities that are usually sedentary. 12       Encourage community design and development that increase the capacity for walking, bicycling, and other self-powered transportation.   Commuting to work or school by walking, bicycling, or by other physically active transportation can be an excellent way for adults to meet daily exercise recommendations. 2 Alongside New York City\u2019s strategies for building a greater capacity for self-powered transportation, such as walking and bicycling, NYU can expand students\u2019 abilities to use active modes of transportation. 28,29 Opportunities for such expansion could include opening up previously unused stairwells and increasing availability of bicycle racks.

Key Facts     24.3% of NYU students are overweight, of which 6.0% are obese. 1   Physical inactivity is a primary contributor to one-third of the adult population\u2019s being  overweight or obese. 26     The incidence of obesity in the U.S. college-aged population has increased from 12% in 1991 to 36% in 2004. 21   Only 45% of adults get the recommended 30 minutes of physical activity on 5 or more days per week, and adolescents are similarly inactive. 9   81 to 85% of adults continue the same physical activity patterns that they establish during their senior year of college. 12   An estimated 40 to 45% of college students engage in fitness activities regularly (\u22653 days/week). 30,31   Non-exercising adults are more likely to be absent from work for more than 7 days when  compared to those exercising at least once per week. 16   Students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher are three times more likely to exercise than those with lower grades. 25                                           Recommendations     Implement point-of-decision prompts and motivational signage around campus to encourage stairwell use, walking, and other self-powered transportation.  Point-of-decision prompts are visual cues used to guide individuals in adopting healthy behaviors. These prompts serve to integrate physical activity into daily living, create a climate where choices to be active are encouraged, and increase awareness about the benefits of physical activity. 7 This strategy is appropriate for diverse populations and settings and has proven effective in eliciting desired active living behaviors. 9 Placing point-of-decision prompts at locations such as elevator banks, stairwells, and NYU trolley stops will help students recognize cues and opportunities for physical activity. 9     Improve existing on-campus exercise facilities.  NYU\u2019s Coles Sports Center and Palladium Athletic Facility accommodate 1 million students, faculty, staff, and alumni visits to the facilities each year, supervise over 1,200 students playing on club sports and intramural teams, and enroll more than 8,000 NYU community members in 235+ recreation courses. 27 Recognizing the importance of fitness centers, NYU will continue to improve its existing on-campus exercise facilities to meet the evolving needs of the NYU community. 12 Many factors have been shown to impact fitness center utilization, including effective signage and suitable information about the facilities available on campus, accessibility and variety of exercise equipment, flexible class options and schedules, and aesthetic attributes such as air conditioning, lockers, or media. 10,12 NYU will continue to implement innovative solutions to make its exercise facilities and resources accessible and appealing.       Develop and implement tools to support physical fitness.  Tools such as pedometers and interactive technologies have been shown to be effective in helping students reach and maintain their physical activity goals. Devices to support physical activity can be personal items, which reflect individual preferences, allow for self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and incremental goal-setting. 11 Technology-based resources in particular can allow for individually tailored assistance or advice based on factors such as an individual\u2019s specific interests, preferences, and readiness for change. 8,9       Improve awareness of and access to non-gym-based physical activity opportunities.  Gym-based exercise may not be the preferred method of physical activity for some students because of location, time, perceived cost, motivation, or student comfort. 19,20 NYU and the surrounding community offer a wealth of resources to accommodate the spectrum of students\u2019 needs and preferences. Living an active lifestyle by integrating physical activity into an individual\u2019s daily routine can be an effective way to increase personal fitness. 5,6,9 Expanding structured programs for self-powered transportation, building partnerships with local vendors, and using technology-based methods increase the variety of and access to opportunities for physical activity .5,6,9,17       Expand NYU organized physical activity opportunities such as peer support, classes, and extracurricular clubs.   Building, strengthening, and maintaining social networks are effective strategies for increasing physical activity and improving overall physical fitness. 4 The use of peer support and interactive social groups, such as classes and clubs, can increase engagement in physical activity by giving students the opportunity to be connected to other students and staff members, thereby enabling them to monitor their progress and encouraging them to continue their activities. 5 These opportunities for physical activity can also reduce or eliminate some of the barriers to physical activity, such as safety concerns and lack of motivation. 9       Develop physical activity-focused special events.  Involvement in university life is an important and vital aspect of a student\u2019s collegiate career; special events, such as competitions and challenges, can be an effective method for getting students focused on and excited about participating in health-related activities, and for promoting physical activity. 18,32 Creating University-wide events focused throughout the academic school year will not only engage students individually but can also cultivate social norms and traditions around physical activity.       Reduce barriers to safe physical activity.  Nationally, safety concerns are a leading barrier to participating in physical activity. 2,5 Students are more likely to live active lifestyles if they feel safe and comfortable in their surroundings.6 Educating students about personal safety precautions and providing access to safety equipment may help reduce barriers to exercising outdoors.6 Such precautions include: being aware of their surroundings; exercising with a partner in a well-lit area or during daytime hours; or learning self-defense techniques. 2       Strengthen the integration of physical activity with the NYU academic curriculum.  Physical activity has been shown to enhance brain function and improve on-task behavior during academic instruction time. 3,13 NYU can integrate physical activity with learning by: scheduling physical activity breaks during instruction time, creating opportunities for students to be active through non-sedentary learning activities, providing institutional recognition for students\u2019 co-curricular fitness skills and achievements throughout their tenure at NYU, and increasing for-credit physical activity-based courses. 3,12,14,15 By providing a learning environment in which physical activity is incorporated, NYU has the potential to impact students\u2019 short- and long-term physical activity behaviors, and to maximize students\u2019 learning during academic activities that are usually sedentary. 12       Encourage community design and development that increase the capacity for walking, bicycling, and other self-powered transportation.   Commuting to work or school by walking, bicycling, or by other physically active transportation can be an excellent way for adults to meet daily exercise recommendations. 2 Alongside New York City\u2019s strategies for building a greater capacity for self-powered transportation, such as walking and bicycling, NYU can expand students\u2019 abilities to use active modes of transportation. 28,29 Opportunities for such expansion could include opening up previously unused stairwells and increasing availability of bicycle racks.

Key Facts     24.3% of NYU students are overweight, of which 6.0% are obese. 1   Physical inactivity is a primary contributor to one-third of the adult population\u2019s being  overweight or obese. 26     The incidence of obesity in the U.S. college-aged population has increased from 12% in 1991 to 36% in 2004. 21   Only 45% of adults get the recommended 30 minutes of physical activity on 5 or more days per week, and adolescents are similarly inactive. 9   81 to 85% of adults continue the same physical activity patterns that they establish during their senior year of college. 12   An estimated 40 to 45% of college students engage in fitness activities regularly (\u22653 days/week). 30,31   Non-exercising adults are more likely to be absent from work for more than 7 days when  compared to those exercising at least once per week. 16   Students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher are three times more likely to exercise than those with lower grades. 25                                           Recommendations     Implement point-of-decision prompts and motivational signage around campus to encourage stairwell use, walking, and other self-powered transportation.  Point-of-decision prompts are visual cues used to guide individuals in adopting healthy behaviors. These prompts serve to integrate physical activity into daily living, create a climate where choices to be active are encouraged, and increase awareness about the benefits of physical activity. 7 This strategy is appropriate for diverse populations and settings and has proven effective in eliciting desired active living behaviors. 9 Placing point-of-decision prompts at locations such as elevator banks, stairwells, and NYU trolley stops will help students recognize cues and opportunities for physical activity. 9     Improve existing on-campus exercise facilities.  NYU\u2019s Coles Sports Center and Palladium Athletic Facility accommodate 1 million students, faculty, staff, and alumni visits to the facilities each year, supervise over 1,200 students playing on club sports and intramural teams, and enroll more than 8,000 NYU community members in 235+ recreation courses. 27 Recognizing the importance of fitness centers, NYU will continue to improve its existing on-campus exercise facilities to meet the evolving needs of the NYU community. 12 Many factors have been shown to impact fitness center utilization, including effective signage and suitable information about the facilities available on campus, accessibility and variety of exercise equipment, flexible class options and schedules, and aesthetic attributes such as air conditioning, lockers, or media. 10,12 NYU will continue to implement innovative solutions to make its exercise facilities and resources accessible and appealing.       Develop and implement tools to support physical fitness.  Tools such as pedometers and interactive technologies have been shown to be effective in helping students reach and maintain their physical activity goals. Devices to support physical activity can be personal items, which reflect individual preferences, allow for self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and incremental goal-setting. 11 Technology-based resources in particular can allow for individually tailored assistance or advice based on factors such as an individual\u2019s specific interests, preferences, and readiness for change. 8,9       Improve awareness of and access to non-gym-based physical activity opportunities.  Gym-based exercise may not be the preferred method of physical activity for some students because of location, time, perceived cost, motivation, or student comfort. 19,20 NYU and the surrounding community offer a wealth of resources to accommodate the spectrum of students\u2019 needs and preferences. Living an active lifestyle by integrating physical activity into an individual\u2019s daily routine can be an effective way to increase personal fitness. 5,6,9 Expanding structured programs for self-powered transportation, building partnerships with local vendors, and using technology-based methods increase the variety of and access to opportunities for physical activity .5,6,9,17       Expand NYU organized physical activity opportunities such as peer support, classes, and extracurricular clubs.   Building, strengthening, and maintaining social networks are effective strategies for increasing physical activity and improving overall physical fitness. 4 The use of peer support and interactive social groups, such as classes and clubs, can increase engagement in physical activity by giving students the opportunity to be connected to other students and staff members, thereby enabling them to monitor their progress and encouraging them to continue their activities. 5 These opportunities for physical activity can also reduce or eliminate some of the barriers to physical activity, such as safety concerns and lack of motivation. 9       Develop physical activity-focused special events.  Involvement in university life is an important and vital aspect of a student\u2019s collegiate career; special events, such as competitions and challenges, can be an effective method for getting students focused on and excited about participating in health-related activities, and for promoting physical activity. 18,32 Creating University-wide events focused throughout the academic school year will not only engage students individually but can also cultivate social norms and traditions around physical activity.       Reduce barriers to safe physical activity.  Nationally, safety concerns are a leading barrier to participating in physical activity. 2,5 Students are more likely to live active lifestyles if they feel safe and comfortable in their surroundings.6 Educating students about personal safety precautions and providing access to safety equipment may help reduce barriers to exercising outdoors.6 Such precautions include: being aware of their surroundings; exercising with a partner in a well-lit area or during daytime hours; or learning self-defense techniques. 2       Strengthen the integration of physical activity with the NYU academic curriculum.  Physical activity has been shown to enhance brain function and improve on-task behavior during academic instruction time. 3,13 NYU can integrate physical activity with learning by: scheduling physical activity breaks during instruction time, creating opportunities for students to be active through non-sedentary learning activities, providing institutional recognition for students\u2019 co-curricular fitness skills and achievements throughout their tenure at NYU, and increasing for-credit physical activity-based courses. 3,12,14,15 By providing a learning environment in which physical activity is incorporated, NYU has the potential to impact students\u2019 short- and long-term physical activity behaviors, and to maximize students\u2019 learning during academic activities that are usually sedentary. 12       Encourage community design and development that increase the capacity for walking, bicycling, and other self-powered transportation.   Commuting to work or school by walking, bicycling, or by other physically active transportation can be an excellent way for adults to meet daily exercise recommendations. 2 Alongside New York City\u2019s strategies for building a greater capacity for self-powered transportation, such as walking and bicycling, NYU can expand students\u2019 abilities to use active modes of transportation. 28,29 Opportunities for such expansion could include opening up previously unused stairwells and increasing availability of bicycle racks.
