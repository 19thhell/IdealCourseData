Our work spans work in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.       The post-2015 global development goals will focus on sustainable development, built on the three pillars of social inclusion, economic development, and environmental sustainability. Goals and targets for education and early childhood development, stretching from birth to adulthood, will benefit from a focus on policies and programs that facilitate lifelong and multi-generational learning .    Our core strategies include summarizing and leveraging the global science of child, youth and adult learning for effective programs and policies; capacity-building for systems leaders in child and youth development and education; and improvement of policy implementation and program quality in specific local, national and regional contexts.
