These Showings are opportunities for students from both the Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degree programs to perform and choreograph. Supervised by our experienced faculty, these showings are comprised entirely of student choreographers and serve as a means through which students experiment with different aesthetics, styles, and concepts of dance. Additionally, Showing IV offers choreographers and dancers the opportunity to explore the use of digital and new media as a part of the choreographic process. Lasting around an hour and a half, the Showings are performed with full lights, costumes, are a wonderful display of the individuality, ingenuity, and intelligence of the dancers and choreographers at Tisch. For tickets, reserve online or call the Dance Office at 212-998-1982 between 9am and 4pm M/F.
