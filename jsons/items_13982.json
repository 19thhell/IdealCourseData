Professionals who understand these game-changing shifts similarly recognize our need for newer forms of management. That recognition leads them to the School of Engineering&#39;s MS program in Management (MSM).   The program is defined by a pragmatic, results-oriented approach emphasizing the integration of people and technology, which we achieve through courses designed to help you develop decision-making skills. Even subjects such as accounting, finance, and marketing are taught not as special areas of expertise, but as basic tools for managerial decision-making in a tech-heavy, knowledge-based workplace.   You&rsquo;ll build on such core competencies by focusing on 1 of the following concentrations:      entrepreneurship    electronic business    project management    technology management    information and telecommunications management    human resource management    construction management     By the program&rsquo;s end, you&rsquo;ll be able to allocate and direct human, financial, and physical resources, as well as technological and organizational assets, for maximum performance.   Best of all, you can learn these skills while maintaining a busy career since classes are typically scheduled after regular business hours.   Admission Requirements   Satisfactory scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or an acceptable equivalent test, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be requested to support admission.   The program requires some fundamental knowledge of probability and statistics. Students without such a background are required to take a managerial probability and statistics course such as MA 2054, MG 5050, or its equivalent. Students with this background may apply to waive this requirement.

The management course program helps students develop a repertoire of skills to anticipate, address, and resolve the central challenges of running organizations in the 21st century. You will learn how to identify (and implement) the best strategy for a firm. You will also examine ways in which people work as individuals, as team members, and as organizational members.    You may also consider pursuing the Management Consulting Track (MCT). Stern\u2019s approach is to teach consulting as an effective way of thinking about businesses and solving business problems that is applicable in any job role inside and outside the consulting industry. Consultants identify and adapt \u201cbest practices\u201d to the firms that hire them, working on different projects across different industries with access to the top executives in the firms they consult to. Consultants can be called on for their strategic, operational, industry, and financial expertise. This track is an excellent complement to a concentration in management as well as in other areas (e.g. finance, marketing, accounting).    The courses that contribute to this track have this symbol, MCT, next to the course title.     Career Preparation  All careers involve the management of individuals and groups. The management program is designed to provide students with both practical skills and an understanding of the underlying theory that will make you an effective individual contributor and manager. You will learn to view the business as a whole, to evaluate the overall needs of an organization (for-profit, and not-for-profit and government) and to define supporting objectives. You will develop an outlook that enables you to perceive and anticipate opportunities to innovate and the need for change.    As management always involves people, courses present the most recent theories concerned with human behavior along with current practices that affect and influence behavior in work organizations. The management course program complements the more specialized focus that necessarily characterizes courses in other functional areas. It helps students prepare and succeed in a managerial career that leverages but is not limited to a functional specialization.     Management Concentration Requirements (12 units)  Students who decide to concentrate in management will take four courses (12 units) in advanced management electives after completing the required core course Management and Organizations MGMT-UB 1. Some multidisciplinary (MULT-UB) courses have also been approved to count toward fulfilling management concentration requirements.    Students pursuing a concentration in management and organizations should consult with their adviser in the Stern Office of Academic Advising by the end of sophomore year to ensure that course distribution requirements are being met and to formally declare the management concentration. The Department of Management and Organizations undergraduate faculty adviser is always available to advise you on which management courses best fulfill your objectives.
