To request an application fee waiver, please submit a written request to scps.gradadmissions@nyu.edu , detailing why you wish to be considered for the waiver. Additionally, you must submit financial documentation that demonstrates your financial hardship. Your request must be e-mailed prior to you submitting your application, not after submission and payment. The application fee is waived for U.S. veterans as long as they can provide documentation that indicates their service.               How long will it take to process my application for admission, and when will I receive a response?        The Admissions Committee begins issuing admission decisions for the fall term in March, for the spring term in August, and for the summer term in January. Fall applicants who submit a complete application by February 1 are guaranteed an admission decision by March 15. Admission decisions for fall applications received or completed after February 1 will be issued after April 15. Applications received thereafter for the fall term will be reviewed on a rolling basis, and decisions are typically rendered within two to four weeks of receipt of a complete application. Admission decisions for summer and spring applications are typically made within two to four weeks after the Admissions Committee has begun the review process for your intended term of entry.   The Office of Admissions provides written decisions only and will not release a decision over the telephone.               I submitted my application materials. How can I check my admission status?          All applicants who apply online are able to view their admission status using our online system. The Office of Admissions sends an e-mail acknowledgment to all applicants upon receipt of an application. Instructions for checking your admission status are included in this acknowledgment e-mail.                 I just submitted my application. Why does the online application status check show documents that I have submitted as being \u201cincomplete\u201d?          The status check in the online application is not automatically updated when your application is submitted. If you have just submitted your application, the Office of Admissions has not yet been able to process it and match it to any credentials submitted with your online application or received separately. The status check will be updated as your application is processed and will clearly indicate if your application is still being processed. It also will indicate if any documents are missing.                 Can I apply to a graduate program before I complete my undergraduate degree?        You may apply to a graduate program during your last term of undergraduate study. If you are admitted, you will be required to submit an official transcript conferring your undergraduate degree within your first semester of study.               Do I need to submit transcripts from educational institutions even if I attended many years ago or didn\u2019t complete a degree there?          Yes. In order to conduct a complete and holistic review of an application, the Office of Admissions needs to evaluate transcripts from all institutions previously attended.                 How can transcripts be submitted?          Official transcripts must be submitted to the Office of Admissions at the address below in a sealed envelope. The envelope(s) may be mailed directly by the institution(s) at which you studied or they may be delivered by you to the Office of Admissions.   The Office of Admissions will review applications accompanied by unofficial copies of transcripts. You may submit unofficial copies to our office via fax or e-mail or by uploading them to your online application. If you are admitted, we must receive official transcripts within your first semester of study.
