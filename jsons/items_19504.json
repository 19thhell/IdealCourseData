An individual sponsor, the OGS Affidavit of Support plus a bank statement and/or letter from employer confirming annual salary and sponsor's position. (The sponsor's annual salary should be at least 3 times the amount of money they are providing to the student).   If you will be staying somewhere where you will receive free room and board, you need to provide a letter from who you are staying with indicating the amount of support they will provide for you and the duration of time you will stay with them. The in-kind value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.    An organizational sponsor, a copy of an award letter from a sponsoring organization specifying the amount of the award, its duration, and the terms of renewal, or  NYU funding, a copy of an NYU award letter for an NYU scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship.     All financial documentation must be in English or have certified English translations attached to the original and must be dated from within the last six months.

The in-kind value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.    An organizational sponsor, a copy of an award letter from a sponsoring organization specifying the amount of the award, its duration, and the terms of renewal, or  NYU funding, a copy of an NYU award letter for an NYU scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship.     All financial documentation must be in English or have certified English translations attached to the original and must be dated from within the last six months.

Anticipate that all costs related to study at NYU will increase approximately 5% for the 2015-2016 academic year and every subsequent year. This increase may be reflected on the I-20 or DS-2019 you receive and therefore may not match precisely the amounts listed below. If you have questions about exact fees, check the NYU Bursar's Office website at www.nyu.edu/bursar .   Find your school at NYU in the column on the left. The columns to the right indicate the 2014-2015 full-time tuition of 24 credits (one academic year) plus service fees, estimated living expenses and health insurance. The total estimated expense plus any additional dependent expenses is what you must document for issuance of the I-20 or DS-2019. Full payment of tuition and fees is due upon registration for classes, which takes place in August/September for the fall semester and January for the spring semester.   Students must demonstrate that they have sufficient liquid assets to cover tuition and living expenses for at least one year of study.

Supporting documents may include but are not limited to:     Personal funds, a current financial statement, printed on letterhead and signed by a bank official, dated within six months.   A personal loan, a pre-approval letter confirming amount for which the loan is approved. A loan application is not sufficient.   An individual sponsor, the OGS Affidavit of Support plus a bank statement and/or letter from employer confirming annual salary and sponsor's position. (The sponsor's annual salary should be at least 3 times the amount of money they are providing to the student).   If you will be staying somewhere where you will receive free room and board, you need to provide a letter from who you are staying with indicating the amount of support they will provide for you and the duration of time you will stay with them. The in-kind value of room and board is estimated to be $10,000 per year.    An organizational sponsor, a copy of an award letter from a sponsoring organization specifying the amount of the award, its duration, and the terms of renewal, or  NYU funding, a copy of an NYU award letter for an NYU scholarship, assistantship, or fellowship.     All financial documentation must be in English or have certified English translations attached to the original and must be dated from within the last six months.     We don't accept income tax documents or personal property deeds such as ownership of property, a car, jewelry, etc. as evidence of acceptable financial documentation.

This information applies only to the ##LARGESTPROGRAM## program at the institution, which typically takes an average of ##NUMBEROFMONTHS## months for a full-time student to complete. Prices may vary depending on the program of interest and its expected duration.                                                                                                                   Please read.   This net price calculator is intended to provide a general estimate of your potential financial aid package at New York University's New York campus . Please understand that completing this estimator does not take the place of actually applying for financial aid at NYU.   Returning, transfer and graduate students are excluded from the use of this estimator, and those students should review NYU's financial aid policies at Financial Aid and Scholarships to determine the financial aid award process and calendar as applicable.   All freshman applicants are strongly encouraged to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (the FAFSA) and/or the CSS Profile application accurately and on time in order to determine their actual financial aid award (please see Applications and Forms for information regarding NYU's aid application requirements). The Profile data is needed to be considered for institutional grants and scholarships. Federal aid is dependent upon the FAFSA results, and will be awarded to those eligible, even if the preferred deadline is not met. NYU strongly encourages every applicant to carefully consider the financial investment in an NYU education once their actual financial aid award has been received, which typically occurs simultaneously with their offer of admission.   Freshman applicants must correctly follow the financial aid application process and meet the published deadlines to be considered for financial aid at NYU. Note that costs and financial aid estimates are subject to change. The results of this estimator are not actual offers of aid, and may be substantially different from your official aid offer from NYU. The results are based upon the assumption that you will be enrolled full time as an incoming freshman.   The University may not be held liable for any errors, omissions or damages. The estimated awards provided by this reference tool are based upon the assumption that the student will complete the FAFSA and CSS Profile accurately and all other data entered are true at the time of the estimate.   Also note that this estimator is not intended for use by students interested in New York University's Abu Dhabi campus. Students interested in learning about financial support from NYU Abu Dhabi should see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Note: Any information that you provide on this site is confidential.

Grants and scholarships do not have to be repaid. Some students also qualify for student loans to assist in paying this net price; however, student loans do have to be repaid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Please Note: The estimates above apply to full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students only.                                         These estimates do not represent a final determination, or actual award, of financial assistance or a final net              price; they are only estimates based on cost of attendance and financial aid provided to students in 2013-14.              Cost of attendance and financial aid availability change year to year. These estimates shall not be binding on              the Secretary of Education, the institution of higher education, or the State.                          Not all students receive financial aid. In 2013-14, 50% of our full-time students enrolling              for college for the first time received grant/scholarship aid. Students may also be eligible              for student loans and work-study. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student              Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for Federal financial aid that includes              Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance.
