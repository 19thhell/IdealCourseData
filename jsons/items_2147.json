Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.
