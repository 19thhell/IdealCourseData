COURSE DESCRIPTION & OBJECTIVE:    This course is a foundation course for learning software programming using the Java language. The course will introduce the student to programming concepts, programming techniques, and other software development fundamentals. Students will learn the concepts of Object Oriented programming using Java. The course will present an extensive coverage of the Java programming language including how to write, compile and run Java applications.    The purpose of this course is to learn programming concept and Object Oriented fundamentals using Java. Students will receive a solid understanding of the Java language syntax and semantics including Java program structure, data types, program control flow, defining classes and instantiating objects, information hiding and encapsulations, inheritance, exception handling, input/output data streams, memory management, Applets and Swing window components.   The focus of the course will be on the following topics:     Procedural vs. Object Oriented Programming.   Java Data Types  Program control flow  Objects and Classes  Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism  Method overriding and overloading  Exception handling  Input/output streams  Creating windows and applets           BOOKS - (Required / Suggested)     Required Books -     Beginning Java (Java 7 Edition)    Author - Ivor Horton   Publisher - Wrox Press Inc.

Late homeworks will not be accepted.  - Print out your homework code and resulting output and bring with you to class the next time we meet.  - I will either collect, or will ask students to discuss their solutions in class.  - I will not accept homework via email unless you are not able to attend the class.  - Proper indentation is a must. If not properly indented I may return it without grading it.  - Multiple pages should be stapled together. (PS. no paper clip, no folding the corner, etc.)    Grades are FINAL .    Please do not negotiate for a better grade. If you are expecting to receive a grade of an \" A \"  at the end of the semester, then I expect you to attend all sessions (unless I am notified ahead of time),  to participate in these sessions, to keep up with the class reading material, and to complete your homework assigments.  This will ensure that you stay current with the class content, and will ensure that you get a good  grade on your test(s), project as well as your final grade.   If you are a non-credit student, and you are not interested in a grade, or you do not submit your homeworks/project or take the exams,  then you will receive a grade of an \" NE \" (Non-Evaluative). A grade of NE is final, and cannot be changed. A grade of NE cannot be applied as partial fulfillment for any NYU certificate program.
