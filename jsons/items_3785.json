Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 88 children. ASD can hinder a child's ability to socially interact, communicate, and play. Research tells us that early identification, parent training, and intensive intervention can greatly improve children's lives, giving them the greatest chance of achieving their full potential. If a parent or loved one is concerned that a child may be displaying signs of autism, a comprehensive autism evaluation is recommended.   When to seek treatment?   If your child shows two or more of the signs listed below, an evaluation is recommended. It is important to note that there are no absolute clinical indicators of autism and that the presence of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that your child has autism.   Impairment in social interaction:   Lack of appropriate eye gaze   Lack of warm, joyful expressions   Lack of sharing interest or enjoyment   Lack of response to name   Impairment in communication:   Lack of showing gestures   Lack of coordination of nonverbal communication   Unusual prosody in speech (little variation in pitch, odd intonation, irregular rhythm, unusual voice quality)   Repetitive behaviors and restricted interests:   Repetitive movements with objects   Repetitive movements or posturing of the body, arms, hands, or fingers   Specific narrow interests that the child is very focused on learning or talking about   Evaluations   At the Child Study Center, an evaluation at the Early Childhood Autism and Communication Disorders Service includes three visits with clinical and developmental child psychologists who specialize in evaluating toddlers and young children suspected to have autism or other communication disorders. Evaluations are tailored to the needs of each family and include:   behavioral observation   parent interviews   speech-language evaluation   cognitive assessment   adaptive ability assessment   neuropsychological tests, (i.e., cognitive and achievement tests)   the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)   specialized consults as necessary (e.g. with our psychiatrists)   The tasks administered during the evaluation are designed to be play-based and test the child's beginning understanding of words, as well as concepts such as intention, imitation, and social responsiveness. At the end of the evaluation parents will receive a comprehensive feedback session, detailed recommendations, and an in-depth report. Every evaluation also includes a no-cost Service Navigation consult with our experienced social worker, who will review recommendations and provide support in linking to appropriate therapeutic and educational referrals.   The Child Study Center offers follow-up care for early childhood diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Communication Disorder. We will use your evaluation to craft an individualized treatment plan and work with you to implement evidence based practices. We offer specialized treatments including Early Social Interaction Therapy and Pivotal Response Treatment.

As children with autism spectrum disorders also often display comorbidity with other disorders, our externs also have significant exposure to children with ADHD and other Externalizing Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Learning Disorders, and other conditions. Our team utilizes evidence-based behavioral treatments, including applied behavior analysis.   The number of externships available:   New York City Campus: 2 Externs   Clinical Responsibilities:\u00a0   Intervention:\u00a0 Responsibilities include carrying a caseload of up to four individual therapy cases with children and adolescents presenting with autism spectrum disorder. Externs may assist in conducting school observations and school-based behavior consultations using functional behavioral assessment protocol to assist in assessment, treatment planning, and implementation.   Training in, and delivery of, evidence-based treatments: \u00a0Externs will be trained in naturalistic Applied Behavior Analysis, including Pivotal Response Treatment, and Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).   Co-Therapy:\u00a0 Externs may participate as observers and co-therapists with experienced clinicians in assessment and treatment sessions or as co-therapists in group treatments.   Assessment:\u00a0 Externs may participate in psychiatric evaluations and feedback sessions. They will be expected first to shadow one or more evalutions conducted by an attending or post-doctoral fellow and then to be shadowed by an attending or post-doctoral fellow.   Miscellaneous clinical tasks: \u00a0Although building the externs' clinical caseloads is our priority, we supplement with a variety of clinically-relevant activities as needed, including educational and outreach efforts.\u00a0   Writing for AboutOurKids.org website:\u00a0 There may be opportunities to contribute to the CSC's award winning website.   Didactic Requirements:\u00a0   Case Conference (Fridays 9:00 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.)   Grand Rounds (Fridays 11:00 a.m. - 12:15 p.m.)   Two-to-One supervision (TBD)   Autism Spectrum Disorder Seminar (TBD)   The externs assist in presentations within the NYU academic community and external professional and community groups. The role will depend on the extern's level of experience and comfort in the subject area.   Research:   Although this is primarily a clinical externship, the CSC is committed to training scientist-practitioners. Interested externs may also have opportunities to prepare clinical case studies for publication or presentation at a professional conference.\u00a0   Time Requirement:   16 hours per week, usually spread over two full days (one evening)   September 2014-June 2015, but preference is given to those students that can start in July 2014   Contact Information:   Those interested in applying should submit a letter of interest, writing sample (intake report preferred), attestation letter from your graduate program stating your eligibility for externship, two to three letters of recommendation (from professors or clinical supervisors) and CV via our online application. Please note if you are interested in applying to more than one externship within the Child Study Center you must submit an application for each externship seperately. Applicants with further questions should contact\u00a0Sarah Kuriakose, PhD., Director of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Clinical and Research Program, at 646-754-4873, or\u00a0 sarah.kuriakose@nyumc.org .\u00a0                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]}]
