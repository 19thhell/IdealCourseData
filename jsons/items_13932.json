It\u2019s a three-year study looking at RAND research on everything from army logistics to the quality of health care, and draws a number of conclusions about the characteristics of high-performing organizations and how, through careful and appropriate change, they can improve. I\u2019m also conducting a study for the Carnegie Corporation about the value of the national infrastructure on associations, schools, college, universities, publications and networks that help individual nonprofits improve their performance. The basic question is \u2013 What works, what doesn\u2019t, and what is the value of having a nonprofit infrastructure in the first place?               We're trying to understand why it is that there are huge disparities in health outcomes...        John Billings   Associate Professor of Health Policy and Public Service      Read more                      John Billings    Associate Professor of Health Policy and Public Service, ' 13        We're trying to understand why it is that there are huge disparities in health outcomes \u2013 between low-income populations, say \u2013 so that policymakers can find solutions. For example, we looked closely at Medicaid claims date to track how well primary care providers managed their patients. Did one provider have more emergency room visits that another? More primary care visits? What we found was that hospital clinics were much worse at managing patients than private doctors and free-standing, community clinics were. We're trying to sort out why this is. Wagner's Center for Health and Public Service Research (CHPSR) serves as a vehicle for connecting academic research with policymaking and program development in order to address key issues concerning the delivery of health care and social services.               Leadership training is extremely important for non-profit boards...        Anthony Kovner   Professor of Public and Health Management      Read more                      Anthony Kovner    Professor of Public and Health Management, ' 13        Leadership training is extremely important for non-profit boards. The key distinctive characteristic of nonprofits is their mission. The boards of for-profit organizations are accountable to the shareholders, and those of public organizations are accountable to the voters. Part of the problem of accountability of nonprofit boards of trustees is that they often don\u2019t get the information they need to carry out the function they\u2019re supposed to perform.               My research is focused primarily on the well-being of individuals...          Sewin Chan   Associate Professor of Public Policy      Read more                      Sewin Chan    Associate Professor of Public Policy, '        My research is focused primarily on the well-being of individuals and how this is shaped by the interaction of individual decision-making, market institutions and government policies. I\u2019m particularly interested in the economics of aging and retirement, especially the risks facing older households. Recently, I\u2019ve collaborated with Professor Jan Blustein to examine health outcomes and the labor market behavior of grandparents raising their grandchildren. This work will help in developing better policies and programs to support this growing yet vulnerable group that is performing an important social role.                 I am now involved in a study of how social change organizations use various identities\u2014racial, ethnic, class, geographic\u2014as a resource in their work...        Erica Foldy   Associate Professor of Public and Nonprofit Management      Read more                      Erica Foldy    Associate Professor of Public and Nonprofit Management, ' 13        I am now involved in a study of how social change organizations use various identities \u2013 racial, ethnic, class, geographic \u2013 as a resource in their work. In a related arena, I am also interest in team learning and, in particular, how multi-cultural teams can learn from and across difference. I am just embarking on a project studying teams and what enables team learning in a large state social services agency. I am very interested in the mutual influence between social identities, like race, gender and class, and organizational life. How do social identities affect organizations? And how do organizations affect their members\u2019 experience of their social identities? My last study found that, in fact, work organizations do influence their employees\u2019 racial and gender identities, even though those identities are usually understood as largely stable and immune to organizational effects.               My book on the economics of microfinance pulls together ideas from my teaching, research and advising over the past five years...        Jonathan Morduch   Professor of Public Policy and Associate Professor of Economics, FAS      Read more                      Jonathan Morduch    Professor of Public Policy and Associate Professor of Economics, FAS, ' 13        My book on the economics of microfinance pulls together ideas from my teaching, research and advising over the past five years. I\u2019m also studying the politics of microfinance. I want to tell the story of how microfinance became a global movement and why it took the particular form it did. Ultimately, the story has a lot to do with pessimism about the effectiveness of foreign aid, a growing reluctance to redistribute income globally, and an increasing interest in market-based approaches. So the story is about changes in broad policy perspectives as seen through the lens of microfinance.               My book explores the stability of racial integration in neighborhoods...          Ingrid Ellen   Paulette Goddard Professor of Urban Policy and Planning      Read more                      Ingrid Ellen    Paulette Goddard Professor of Urban Policy and Planning, ' 13        My book explores the stability of racial integration in neighborhoods. The conventional view, to borrow Saul Alinsky\u2019s famous line, is that racial integration is merely the time between when the first black moves in and the last white moves out. Counter to this view, I found that many neighborhoods in the United States are racially integrated and stay that way for years. Integration has become both more prevalent and more stable over the last several decades. Still, metropolitan areas in the United States remain highly segregated and many integrated neighborhoods do \u201ctip\u201d top become majority black. Thus, in the second half of the book, I explore why this happens and why certain neighborhoods can remain successfully integrated over time.                 Leadership in public sector and healthcare organizations happens through...        John Donnellan   Robert Derzon Professor of Health &amp; Public Service      Read more                      John Donnellan    Robert Derzon Professor of Health &amp; Public Service, ' 13        Leadership in public sector and healthcare organizations happens through leaders with the ability to communicate and achieve a clear and transformative organizational vision, create a sustainable financial structure, align the organizational structure to achieve the vision, and adapt continuously. Leaders of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s public organizations must understand how to gather and use evidence to make more effective organizational systems and strategic decisions. They must create accountable organizations and be personally accountable. They must be persons of courage and integrity.               By 2030, when Baby Boomers will be between 66 and 84 years old, they will still represent more than 20% of the U.S. population...        David Elcott   The Henry and Marilyn Taub Professor of Practice in Public Service and Leadership      Read more                      David Elcott    The Henry and Marilyn Taub Professor of Practice in Public Service and Leadership, ' 13        By 2030, when Baby Boomers will be between 66 and 84 years old, they will still represent more than 20% of the U.S. population. They are healthier, wealthier, more mobile, and more highly educated than any preceding generation, and the presumption is that they will remain active and stay involved in society for many decades. This has led to a shift in some of the research about the elderly, from traditional geriatric concerns (health, housing, psychological services) to such issues as full-time \u201cencore\u201d or bridge careers and volunteerism, job flexibility and life meaning, time management and mobility. This cohort could offer 30 or more years of active and creative involvement, revitalizing, in the particular focus of my work, the culture, civic engagement, social services, political activism, intellectual life and artistic creativity and communal institutions of minority and faith-based communities.               My interest in neighborhoods started by thinking about the social networks one develops when raised or living in a poor neighborhood...        Katherine O\u2019Regan   Associate Professor of Public Policy      Read more                      Katherine O\u2019Regan    Associate Professor of Public Policy, ' 13        Although I am trained as an economist, my interest in neighborhoods started by thinking about the social networks one develops when raised or living in a poor neighborhood. Such networks can be very important for a variety of reasons, including creating expectations about work and even finding a specific job. In fact, it turns out that more than half of jobs are found through some you know, and people ion low-income neighborhoods, where employment levels are low, may well face a big disadvantage. The importance of neighborhoods in shaping people\u2019s life chances has sparked my interest in several aspects of community development efforts, such as the provision of affordable housing, and the performance \u2013 particularly the governance \u2013 of nonprofit and community based organizations.

It\u2019s a three-year study looking at RAND research on everything from army logistics to the quality of health care, and draws a number of conclusions about the characteristics of high-performing organizations and how, through careful and appropriate change, they can improve. I\u2019m also conducting a study for the Carnegie Corporation about the value of the national infrastructure on associations, schools, college, universities, publications and networks that help individual nonprofits improve their performance. The basic question is \u2013 What works, what doesn\u2019t, and what is the value of having a nonprofit infrastructure in the first place?               We're trying to understand why it is that there are huge disparities in health outcomes...        John Billings   Associate Professor of Health Policy and Public Service      Read more                      John Billings    Associate Professor of Health Policy and Public Service, ' 13        We're trying to understand why it is that there are huge disparities in health outcomes \u2013 between low-income populations, say \u2013 so that policymakers can find solutions. For example, we looked closely at Medicaid claims date to track how well primary care providers managed their patients. Did one provider have more emergency room visits that another? More primary care visits? What we found was that hospital clinics were much worse at managing patients than private doctors and free-standing, community clinics were. We're trying to sort out why this is. Wagner's Center for Health and Public Service Research (CHPSR) serves as a vehicle for connecting academic research with policymaking and program development in order to address key issues concerning the delivery of health care and social services.               Leadership training is extremely important for non-profit boards...        Anthony Kovner   Professor of Public and Health Management      Read more                      Anthony Kovner    Professor of Public and Health Management, ' 13        Leadership training is extremely important for non-profit boards. The key distinctive characteristic of nonprofits is their mission. The boards of for-profit organizations are accountable to the shareholders, and those of public organizations are accountable to the voters. Part of the problem of accountability of nonprofit boards of trustees is that they often don\u2019t get the information they need to carry out the function they\u2019re supposed to perform.

Sewin Chan   Associate Professor of Public Policy      Read more                      Sewin Chan    Associate Professor of Public Policy, '        My research is focused primarily on the well-being of individuals and how this is shaped by the interaction of individual decision-making, market institutions and government policies. I\u2019m particularly interested in the economics of aging and retirement, especially the risks facing older households. Recently, I\u2019ve collaborated with Professor Jan Blustein to examine health outcomes and the labor market behavior of grandparents raising their grandchildren. This work will help in developing better policies and programs to support this growing yet vulnerable group that is performing an important social role.

In a related arena, I am also interest in team learning and, in particular, how multi-cultural teams can learn from and across difference. I am just embarking on a project studying teams and what enables team learning in a large state social services agency. I am very interested in the mutual influence between social identities, like race, gender and class, and organizational life. How do social identities affect organizations? And how do organizations affect their members\u2019 experience of their social identities? My last study found that, in fact, work organizations do influence their employees\u2019 racial and gender identities, even though those identities are usually understood as largely stable and immune to organizational effects.

Jonathan Morduch   Professor of Public Policy and Associate Professor of Economics, FAS      Read more                      Jonathan Morduch    Professor of Public Policy and Associate Professor of Economics, FAS, ' 13        My book on the economics of microfinance pulls together ideas from my teaching, research and advising over the past five years. I\u2019m also studying the politics of microfinance. I want to tell the story of how microfinance became a global movement and why it took the particular form it did. Ultimately, the story has a lot to do with pessimism about the effectiveness of foreign aid, a growing reluctance to redistribute income globally, and an increasing interest in market-based approaches. So the story is about changes in broad policy perspectives as seen through the lens of microfinance.               My book explores the stability of racial integration in neighborhoods...          Ingrid Ellen   Paulette Goddard Professor of Urban Policy and Planning      Read more                      Ingrid Ellen    Paulette Goddard Professor of Urban Policy and Planning, ' 13        My book explores the stability of racial integration in neighborhoods. The conventional view, to borrow Saul Alinsky\u2019s famous line, is that racial integration is merely the time between when the first black moves in and the last white moves out. Counter to this view, I found that many neighborhoods in the United States are racially integrated and stay that way for years. Integration has become both more prevalent and more stable over the last several decades. Still, metropolitan areas in the United States remain highly segregated and many integrated neighborhoods do \u201ctip\u201d top become majority black. Thus, in the second half of the book, I explore why this happens and why certain neighborhoods can remain successfully integrated over time.

Leaders of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s public organizations must understand how to gather and use evidence to make more effective organizational systems and strategic decisions. They must create accountable organizations and be personally accountable. They must be persons of courage and integrity.

They are healthier, wealthier, more mobile, and more highly educated than any preceding generation, and the presumption is that they will remain active and stay involved in society for many decades. This has led to a shift in some of the research about the elderly, from traditional geriatric concerns (health, housing, psychological services) to such issues as full-time \u201cencore\u201d or bridge careers and volunteerism, job flexibility and life meaning, time management and mobility. This cohort could offer 30 or more years of active and creative involvement, revitalizing, in the particular focus of my work, the culture, civic engagement, social services, political activism, intellectual life and artistic creativity and communal institutions of minority and faith-based communities.

Such networks can be very important for a variety of reasons, including creating expectations about work and even finding a specific job. In fact, it turns out that more than half of jobs are found through some you know, and people ion low-income neighborhoods, where employment levels are low, may well face a big disadvantage. The importance of neighborhoods in shaping people\u2019s life chances has sparked my interest in several aspects of community development efforts, such as the provision of affordable housing, and the performance \u2013 particularly the governance \u2013 of nonprofit and community based organizations.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.

Faculty members come to NYU Wagner from around the country and around the world. With extensive ties to leading health, nonprofit and government institutions, our faculty members bring the complicated and often difficult realities of public service today to Wagner's classrooms. They have chosen NYU Wagner as their home because they understand that today's public service issues require interdisciplinary approaches and creative solutions.\u00a0   Publications and Projects   Our award-winning scholars engage in research that changes the way in which people frame, understand, analyze and act on public issues and policies.

Paul Light   Paulette Goddard Professor of Public Service      Read more                      Paul Light    Paulette Goddard Professor of Public Service, ' 13        I\u2019m currently finishing a book on what the RAND Corporation knows about managing high-performing organizations. It\u2019s a three-year study looking at RAND research on everything from army logistics to the quality of health care, and draws a number of conclusions about the characteristics of high-performing organizations and how, through careful and appropriate change, they can improve. I\u2019m also conducting a study for the Carnegie Corporation about the value of the national infrastructure on associations, schools, college, universities, publications and networks that help individual nonprofits improve their performance. The basic question is \u2013 What works, what doesn\u2019t, and what is the value of having a nonprofit infrastructure in the first place?               We're trying to understand why it is that there are huge disparities in health outcomes...        John Billings   Associate Professor of Health Policy and Public Service      Read more                      John Billings    Associate Professor of Health Policy and Public Service, ' 13        We're trying to understand why it is that there are huge disparities in health outcomes \u2013 between low-income populations, say \u2013 so that policymakers can find solutions. For example, we looked closely at Medicaid claims date to track how well primary care providers managed their patients. Did one provider have more emergency room visits that another? More primary care visits? What we found was that hospital clinics were much worse at managing patients than private doctors and free-standing, community clinics were. We're trying to sort out why this is. Wagner's Center for Health and Public Service Research (CHPSR) serves as a vehicle for connecting academic research with policymaking and program development in order to address key issues concerning the delivery of health care and social services.               Leadership training is extremely important for non-profit boards...        Anthony Kovner   Professor of Public and Health Management      Read more                      Anthony Kovner    Professor of Public and Health Management, ' 13        Leadership training is extremely important for non-profit boards. The key distinctive characteristic of nonprofits is their mission. The boards of for-profit organizations are accountable to the shareholders, and those of public organizations are accountable to the voters. Part of the problem of accountability of nonprofit boards of trustees is that they often don\u2019t get the information they need to carry out the function they\u2019re supposed to perform.               My research is focused primarily on the well-being of individuals...          Sewin Chan   Associate Professor of Public Policy      Read more                      Sewin Chan    Associate Professor of Public Policy, '        My research is focused primarily on the well-being of individuals and how this is shaped by the interaction of individual decision-making, market institutions and government policies. I\u2019m particularly interested in the economics of aging and retirement, especially the risks facing older households. Recently, I\u2019ve collaborated with Professor Jan Blustein to examine health outcomes and the labor market behavior of grandparents raising their grandchildren. This work will help in developing better policies and programs to support this growing yet vulnerable group that is performing an important social role.                 I am now involved in a study of how social change organizations use various identities\u2014racial, ethnic, class, geographic\u2014as a resource in their work...        Erica Foldy   Associate Professor of Public and Nonprofit Management      Read more                      Erica Foldy    Associate Professor of Public and Nonprofit Management, ' 13        I am now involved in a study of how social change organizations use various identities \u2013 racial, ethnic, class, geographic \u2013 as a resource in their work. In a related arena, I am also interest in team learning and, in particular, how multi-cultural teams can learn from and across difference. I am just embarking on a project studying teams and what enables team learning in a large state social services agency. I am very interested in the mutual influence between social identities, like race, gender and class, and organizational life. How do social identities affect organizations? And how do organizations affect their members\u2019 experience of their social identities? My last study found that, in fact, work organizations do influence their employees\u2019 racial and gender identities, even though those identities are usually understood as largely stable and immune to organizational effects.               My book on the economics of microfinance pulls together ideas from my teaching, research and advising over the past five years...        Jonathan Morduch   Professor of Public Policy and Associate Professor of Economics, FAS      Read more                      Jonathan Morduch    Professor of Public Policy and Associate Professor of Economics, FAS, ' 13        My book on the economics of microfinance pulls together ideas from my teaching, research and advising over the past five years. I\u2019m also studying the politics of microfinance. I want to tell the story of how microfinance became a global movement and why it took the particular form it did. Ultimately, the story has a lot to do with pessimism about the effectiveness of foreign aid, a growing reluctance to redistribute income globally, and an increasing interest in market-based approaches. So the story is about changes in broad policy perspectives as seen through the lens of microfinance.               My book explores the stability of racial integration in neighborhoods...          Ingrid Ellen   Paulette Goddard Professor of Urban Policy and Planning      Read more                      Ingrid Ellen    Paulette Goddard Professor of Urban Policy and Planning, ' 13        My book explores the stability of racial integration in neighborhoods. The conventional view, to borrow Saul Alinsky\u2019s famous line, is that racial integration is merely the time between when the first black moves in and the last white moves out. Counter to this view, I found that many neighborhoods in the United States are racially integrated and stay that way for years. Integration has become both more prevalent and more stable over the last several decades. Still, metropolitan areas in the United States remain highly segregated and many integrated neighborhoods do \u201ctip\u201d top become majority black. Thus, in the second half of the book, I explore why this happens and why certain neighborhoods can remain successfully integrated over time.                 Leadership in public sector and healthcare organizations happens through...        John Donnellan   Robert Derzon Professor of Health &amp; Public Service      Read more                      John Donnellan    Robert Derzon Professor of Health &amp; Public Service, ' 13        Leadership in public sector and healthcare organizations happens through leaders with the ability to communicate and achieve a clear and transformative organizational vision, create a sustainable financial structure, align the organizational structure to achieve the vision, and adapt continuously. Leaders of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s public organizations must understand how to gather and use evidence to make more effective organizational systems and strategic decisions. They must create accountable organizations and be personally accountable. They must be persons of courage and integrity.               By 2030, when Baby Boomers will be between 66 and 84 years old, they will still represent more than 20% of the U.S. population...        David Elcott   The Henry and Marilyn Taub Professor of Practice in Public Service and Leadership      Read more                      David Elcott    The Henry and Marilyn Taub Professor of Practice in Public Service and Leadership, ' 13        By 2030, when Baby Boomers will be between 66 and 84 years old, they will still represent more than 20% of the U.S. population. They are healthier, wealthier, more mobile, and more highly educated than any preceding generation, and the presumption is that they will remain active and stay involved in society for many decades. This has led to a shift in some of the research about the elderly, from traditional geriatric concerns (health, housing, psychological services) to such issues as full-time \u201cencore\u201d or bridge careers and volunteerism, job flexibility and life meaning, time management and mobility. This cohort could offer 30 or more years of active and creative involvement, revitalizing, in the particular focus of my work, the culture, civic engagement, social services, political activism, intellectual life and artistic creativity and communal institutions of minority and faith-based communities.               My interest in neighborhoods started by thinking about the social networks one develops when raised or living in a poor neighborhood...        Katherine O\u2019Regan   Associate Professor of Public Policy      Read more                      Katherine O\u2019Regan    Associate Professor of Public Policy, ' 13        Although I am trained as an economist, my interest in neighborhoods started by thinking about the social networks one develops when raised or living in a poor neighborhood. Such networks can be very important for a variety of reasons, including creating expectations about work and even finding a specific job. In fact, it turns out that more than half of jobs are found through some you know, and people ion low-income neighborhoods, where employment levels are low, may well face a big disadvantage. The importance of neighborhoods in shaping people\u2019s life chances has sparked my interest in several aspects of community development efforts, such as the provision of affordable housing, and the performance \u2013 particularly the governance \u2013 of nonprofit and community based organizations.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.
