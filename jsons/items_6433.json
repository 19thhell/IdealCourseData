Description       The twentieth century, in all its innovation and violence, produced forms of music that were equally radical and challenging. This course will study the ways in which music reacted to, reflected, encouraged, resisted and participated in dramatic cultural shifts, ruptures, and movements of the twentieth century. Our study of music will, in turn, spur topics for writing\u2014in journals and critical essays. We will listen to, read and write about the noise machines of Luigi Russolo, the early jazz of New Orleans, the atonality of Arnold Schoenberg, the labor songs of the 1930s, the silence of John Cage, the rebellion of 1960s rock and free jazz, and the anger of rap. Readings may include the writings of musicians like Milton Babbitt, Glenn Gould, and Miles Davis, critical writings of musicologists such as Susan McClary, Lawrence Kramer, and Robert Walser, essays by Theodor Adorno, Ralph Ellison, and Norman Mailer, and fiction and poetry by James Joyce, James Baldwin, Wallace Stevens, Amiri Baraka and others.

Description       The twentieth century, in all its innovation and violence, produced forms of music that were equally radical and challenging. This course will study the ways in which music reacted to, reflected, encouraged, resisted and participated in dramatic cultural shifts, ruptures, and movements of the twentieth century. Our study of music will, in turn, spur topics for writing\u2014in journals and critical essays. We will listen to, read and write about the noise machines of Luigi Russolo, the early jazz of New Orleans, the atonality of Arnold Schoenberg, the labor songs of the 1930s, the silence of John Cage, the rebellion of 1960s rock and free jazz, and the anger of rap. Readings may include the writings of musicians like Milton Babbitt, Glenn Gould, and Miles Davis, critical writings of musicologists such as Susan McClary, Lawrence Kramer, and Robert Walser, essays by Theodor Adorno, Ralph Ellison, and Norman Mailer, and fiction and poetry by James Joyce, James Baldwin, Wallace Stevens, Amiri Baraka and others.
