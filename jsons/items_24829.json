Simultaneously, it is documenting whether or not the risk and protective factors for suicide are uniquely related to LGBT youths' developmental milestones. Dr. Grossman continues to analyze data and disseminate findings as the Co-Investigator of \"Challenges and Coping: The Q &amp; A Project,\" also funded by the National Institute of Mental Health. This five-year project used a longitudinal research design to investigate the mental health consequences of sexual orientation victimization of a diverse sample of gay, lesbian, bisexual youth (ages 15 to 21). Additionally, he is analyzing data and dissmenating findings as the Principal Investigator of four other research projects: \"Transgender Youth: A Vulnerable Population\"; \"Caregiving Among Middle-Aged and Older Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Adults;\" and \"Using Assessments &amp; Program Assignments to Reduce Sexual Minority Stress &amp; Enhance Psychological Well-Being among LGBT Youth\"; and \"Project DAN,\" a study of hurtful and harmful experiences among sexual minority older adults.
