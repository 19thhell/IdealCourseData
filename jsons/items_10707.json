We will read them in translation, but those with sufficient  Arabic competence are encouraged to read the original, or to work comparatively  between the Arabic and English versions.      Rather than a developmental model, in which  modern and contemporary Arabic literature are gauged by how far they have  advanced in relation to Western literary achievement, this course attends to  how literary works function as nodes around which cluster various consequences  \u2013 literary and extra-literary \u2013 and engage with the environments in which they  were written. Participants are encouraged to consider texts through the prisms  of their multiple contexts \u2013 the historical, the social and the cultural, as  well as gender and class \u2013 while attending to them, in contrapuntal fashion, as  works of art.      This course is reading intensive (about  150-200 pages per week) and requires thoughtful analysis of literary texts. We  will consider texts of varying pedigrees: our rallying point in all of our  readings will be the formal elements of the text, such as theme, plot, style  and character. As we discuss these elements, we will investigate how these  works represent modern and contemporary Arab experience, including issues of  modernity and tradition, displacement, migration and exile, oppression and  resistance as well as shifting notions of the nation. We will consider a  variety of perspectives and critical interventions; at all times, we will  consider how literature is, means and does.       Topics in French Literature: An Introduction to Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) Nouis      From Derrida\u2019s critique of  \u201cWestern\u201d categorizations of universality and rationality (logocentrism,  phallogocentrism, humanism, anthropocentrism), to his later reflections on  metaphoricity, translation, and performativity, this course will first explore  the question of \u201cwriting\u201d as it unfolds throughout the 1960\u2019s and beyond. We will  then focus on the more directly political and ethical dimension of Derrida\u2019s  thought, and carefully examine his use of concepts such as hos(ti)pitality,  gift, forgiveness, animality, friendship, faith, and \"\u00e9v\u00e9nement,\"  paying particular attention to his later conversation with Emmanuel Levinas.  Readings will include passages, chapters and essays taken from Writing and  difference (1967), On Grammatology  (1967), Psyche. Inventions of the other (1987), Points..., (1992); Force of Law  (1994); Politics of Friendship (1994); Monolinguism of the Other (1996) ; Of  Hospitality (1997) ; On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness (1997); Philosophy in a Time of Terror (2003); The  Beast and the Sovereign (2008), etc. The course and the readings will be in  English. Topics in Labor and the Global Market: Literature, Film &amp; History Forman Globalization has become a  much-debated and deeply controversial topic. In this class, we will focus on  the ways that labor has been represented and understood, especially in  relationship to the development of capitalism in its global form. We will  explore how the movement of capital, commodities, and workers across the globe  and with seeming indifference to national borders shapes the idea of work and  those who perform it. Of equal importance in our study will be the way that  work transforms the structure of the global economy. Some primary questions we  will explore are: How has the demand for labor required migration and imposed  geographical dislocations? How does labor create value within these new  locations? How do some gain control of the work of others? How do workers  organize themselves and develop community in new locations? How does this  relationship of power change over time? Some likely texts for the course  include: Shakespeare, The Tempest; Ngugi wa Thiong'o\u2019s postcolonial play, I  will Marry When I Want; a Haitian novel about a sugar cane worker who migrates  to the Dominican Republic. We will place these fictional texts in conversation  with visual representations by Diego Rivera, works by Marx, by anthropologists  and narrative filmmakers on sex tourism and domestic labor, and by documentary  filmmakers and historians on global corporations and utopian economies.  Topics: What is Critique? Huber      The philosopher  and theorist Michel Foucault argued that critique is a powerful form of  insubordination and a crucial \u201cinstrument for those who fight, resist, and who  no longer want what is.\u201d But how might critical philosophy, which trades in  ideas, help us combat material and pervasive forms of injustice? What is  theory\u2019s relationship to praxis and to politics, and what kind of theory or  practice is critique? The seminar begins with a consideration of the uneasy  place of critique in the western philosophical tradition. We will read Kant,  Marx, Foucault, Butler, Mahmood and Mbembe among others, in order to establish  a sense of how critique emerges as a mode of radical questioning, an art of  unsettling self-evident answers and interfering with established relations of  power. We will consider what the practice of critique entails, and what it  means to suggest, as these authors do, that critique interrogates the  historically specific relationships between power, truth and the subject. In  the last third of the class, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz,  Ferguson, Reddy, and Chen), a relatively recent body of scholarship that  exemplifies the urgency, risk and daring of critique as a critical  practice.   Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond McHugh     This course explores various representations of otherworlds,  both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or  idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus  on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from  antiquity through our own times. The Age of  angst: German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1938 George      This course  explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and anxiety that pervaded  German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of war, rapid  industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the political  and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the very bedrock  upon which society had been built. The intellectual responses to this pervasive  sense of upheaval and angst, as well as the challenges and changes themselves,  form the focus of this course, as we explore the relationship between modernity  and crisis in early twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will  include Nietzsche, Freud, Simmel, Weber, Kracauer, Benjamin, and Heidegger.  Introduction  to Theory \u2013 German Media Theory: From Aesthetics to Cultural Techniques Smith      This course  presents a survey of the German strain of media theory from the perspective of  the persistent interchanges and parallels between it and social thought and  forms. We will follow a trajectory that can be roughly outlined by four  movements: 1) Media theory\u2019s ancestors in classical philosophy; 2) The boom in  aesthetic theory that took place in 18th-century German philosophy, one still  based in a humanistic understanding of the world; 3) late 20th-century  discussions of discourse networks and systems theory, which attempt to  de-center the human subject in favor of an understanding of the technical  forces that drive history; and 4) the contemporary understanding of the  intertwined nature of technical media and culture proposed in the school of  \u201ccultural techniques.\u201d Thus this course additionally addresses the ways in  which Media Studies provides a template for understanding the ethical, legal,  and social position of human subject in the \u201cdigital\u201d and technologically  mediated world.  Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance Taxidou The   encounters with Greek Tragedy throughout the ages have not only shaped   our understanding of theatre in the Western canon, but have also   informed basic concepts and theories of classicism, neo-classicism and   humanism more broadly. A privileged genre in aesthetic theory, its   powerful roles (like Clytemnestra, Oedipus, Antigone) have had a huge   impact on modern thinking, from psychoanalysis and philosophy to legal   and political theory. This course will take an interdisciplinary   approach to Greek Tragedy, bringing together critical languages from   Classics, Theatre Studies, Performance Theory, but also philosophy and   critical theory. Through a series of close readings of key   play-texts by the three tragedians--Aeschylus, Sophocles and   Euripes--this course will analyse the development of Greek tragedy as a   dramatic genre and vehicle for performance within the context of the   democratic city-state. It will also look at the ways these texts have   been re-written and re-imagined for performance within the broader   context of modernity. Literature &amp; Society in the Middle East Igsiz Examines selected works in translation of leading 20th-century poets,   novelists, and short story writers that reflect changing conditions and   mores within Middle Eastern and North African societies. Investigates   such topics as conflicts between traditionalists and modernists, the   impact of urbanization on rural societies, and the existential dilemmas   of men and women.

The seminar begins with a consideration of the uneasy  place of critique in the western philosophical tradition. We will read Kant,  Marx, Foucault, Butler, Mahmood and Mbembe among others, in order to establish  a sense of how critique emerges as a mode of radical questioning, an art of  unsettling self-evident answers and interfering with established relations of  power. We will consider what the practice of critique entails, and what it  means to suggest, as these authors do, that critique interrogates the  historically specific relationships between power, truth and the subject. In  the last third of the class, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz,  Ferguson, Reddy, and Chen), a relatively recent body of scholarship that  exemplifies the urgency, risk and daring of critique as a critical  practice.   Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond McHugh     This course explores various representations of otherworlds,  both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or  idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus  on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from  antiquity through our own times. The Age of  angst: German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1938 George      This course  explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and anxiety that pervaded  German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of war, rapid  industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the political  and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the very bedrock  upon which society had been built. The intellectual responses to this pervasive  sense of upheaval and angst, as well as the challenges and changes themselves,  form the focus of this course, as we explore the relationship between modernity  and crisis in early twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will  include Nietzsche, Freud, Simmel, Weber, Kracauer, Benjamin, and Heidegger.  Introduction  to Theory \u2013 German Media Theory: From Aesthetics to Cultural Techniques Smith      This course  presents a survey of the German strain of media theory from the perspective of  the persistent interchanges and parallels between it and social thought and  forms. We will follow a trajectory that can be roughly outlined by four  movements: 1) Media theory\u2019s ancestors in classical philosophy; 2) The boom in  aesthetic theory that took place in 18th-century German philosophy, one still  based in a humanistic understanding of the world; 3) late 20th-century  discussions of discourse networks and systems theory, which attempt to  de-center the human subject in favor of an understanding of the technical  forces that drive history; and 4) the contemporary understanding of the  intertwined nature of technical media and culture proposed in the school of  \u201ccultural techniques.\u201d Thus this course additionally addresses the ways in  which Media Studies provides a template for understanding the ethical, legal,  and social position of human subject in the \u201cdigital\u201d and technologically  mediated world.  Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance Taxidou The   encounters with Greek Tragedy throughout the ages have not only shaped   our understanding of theatre in the Western canon, but have also   informed basic concepts and theories of classicism, neo-classicism and   humanism more broadly. A privileged genre in aesthetic theory, its   powerful roles (like Clytemnestra, Oedipus, Antigone) have had a huge   impact on modern thinking, from psychoanalysis and philosophy to legal   and political theory. This course will take an interdisciplinary   approach to Greek Tragedy, bringing together critical languages from   Classics, Theatre Studies, Performance Theory, but also philosophy and   critical theory. Through a series of close readings of key   play-texts by the three tragedians--Aeschylus, Sophocles and   Euripes--this course will analyse the development of Greek tragedy as a   dramatic genre and vehicle for performance within the context of the   democratic city-state. It will also look at the ways these texts have   been re-written and re-imagined for performance within the broader   context of modernity. Literature &amp; Society in the Middle East Igsiz Examines selected works in translation of leading 20th-century poets,   novelists, and short story writers that reflect changing conditions and   mores within Middle Eastern and North African societies. Investigates   such topics as conflicts between traditionalists and modernists, the   impact of urbanization on rural societies, and the existential dilemmas   of men and women.

Description       This course examines the work of contemporary female novelists and artists of the Middle East and North Africa. Our objective is to critically investigate how the categories of \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018sexuality\u2019 are narrated in the Arab context. We will ask the following questions: what, if anything, is particular to the representation of women in the Arab world? How are these texts symptomatic of and/or resistant to dominant narratives of gendered identity emerging from both the Arab world and West? What are the relationships between gender ideologies and the projects of colonialism, nationalism and globalization? How do gender and sexuality intersect with questions of race, class and religion? What archetypes, tropes and symbols do these works employ, complicate or challenge? How have these images shifted historically and what non-normative visions of gender and sexuality have emerged? Readings include fiction by Sahar Khalifa, Hanan al-Shaykh, Huda Barakat, Ahlam Mosteghanemi, Somaya Ramadan, Mansoura Ez-Eldin and Radwa Ashour. Readings will be paired with film, art and video installations, as well as theoretical selections on: feminism in the Arab world, women and Islam, Orientalism and Queer Theory.
