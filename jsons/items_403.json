Back to Home               Pan-Africanism in Academia: John Henrik Clarke and the African Heritage Studies Association   Thursday, May 22nd, 2014, 10:30 a.m.         at       CIRHUS, Dean's Conference Room, 2nd floor     At the 1969 African Studies Association annual meeting in Montreal, a group of Black intellectuals, soon referred to as the \u00ab Black caucus \u00bb, challenged what they described as the neo-colonial functioning of the organization and pressed for greater Black representation within its leadership. This conflict soon gave rise to the African Heritage Studies Association. Under the leadership of John Henrik Clarke and James Turner, the AHSA organized meetings and transnational networks of Black studies scholars. Its members were all scholars of African descent, specialized in the study of the African continent and its diaspora. Community activists as well as public intellectuals, they believed that Black studies should be connected to the day-to-day realities of Black communities and saw their academic involvment as part of a global fight against imperial powers. For many contemporary scholars, the 1969 founding of the AHSA represented the first manifesto of Afrocentrism within North American academic circles. It was thought of as one of the first attempt by a group of African American activists to consciously racialize social sciences and to claim for the reconstruction of African history along what John Henrik Clarke already called \u00ab afrocentric \u00bb lines. Based on an ongoing archival research on African American academic activism in the late 1960\u2019s, this presentation will argue that beyond Afrocentrism, what the members of the AHSA were trying to create in Montreal was a Pan-African organization grounded in politics and anticolonial struggles. In their view, the rewriting of African history was a first step toward a broader revolution that could affect power relations in the United States and help build a united Pan-African community.
