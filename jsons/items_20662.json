This course tries to duplicate the realities of the production sound mixer\u2019s life both at Tisch and in the professional world. Starting with a concentrated foundation in the tools of the trade, the semester moves through a series of workshops that present the student with a variety of situations like those faced on a working set. Workshops include many different and challenging scenes and situations, both interior and exterior, in which the students do complex multi-mic mixes. Other workshops focus on very specific aspects of the mixer\u2019s craft: radio mics, light and boom shadows, time-code and music playback, etc. the goals are to provide both professional skills and attitudes and to create an understanding of how production mixers bring the director\u2019s vision to the screen. The final project is the production mix of a film or video for one of the intermediate production courses.
