Angel, formerly an FMLN guerrilla, was a mortal enemy of Nicolas, who was a policeman during the conflict. Now they are both members of the National Civil Police - and friends. Miguel and Vitelio are war orphans, trying to reconstruct a semblance of family life. And Francisco is a happy to lucky bus ticket collector whose primary interests are women and Hollywood. As the film presents the lives of Salvadorans today, it also questions the stability of the calm and asks whether the foundations of the peace accord - controlling delinquency, meting justice, redistributing land, and fighting poverty - will ever be realized. Seven Dreams of Peace is a hopeful and troubling look at the legacy of the war in El Salvador.

Call Number: VCA 7913  Summary: In Mexico on January 1, 1994, Indians of Mayan origin staged an armed take-over of several Chiapas municipalities. But the Zapatista Army of National Liberation did not wish to seize power; rather it demanded land, work, housing, education, healthcare, food, justice, independence, freedom and democracy. The Indians&#39; spokesman and head of military operations, Sub-commander Marcos, is not an Indian. He has been able to rally public opinion on the Indians&#39; tragic living conditions. Now a war of words has replaced the armed struggle. The Zapatista movement&#39;s cause echoes worldwide but the lives of the Indians today in the mountains and the jungles of Chiapas are no less precarious than before. In this documentary if is the Indian men and women who speak, re-situating their struggle in its human, cultural and historical context.      TITLE: YANKI NO!

PHYSICAL FEATURES: 1 videocassette (53 min.) : sd., b&amp;w ; 1/2 in.  Call Number: VCA 1440  Summary: This &quot;film editorial&quot; reviews U.S. relations with Latin America in general and with Cuba and Venezuela in particular in the early 1960&#39;s. At a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) in San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. uses its influence to expel Cuba from the meeting and sponsors the Declaration of San Jose, condemning Sino-Soviet intervention in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere and the shipment of Soviet missiles to Cuba. Venezuelan foreign minister Arcaya sides with Cuba at the meeting and is subsequently removed from office by Venezuelan president Betancourt. This action spurs big anti-American protests in Caracas. The film then looks at the general dire poverty that prevails throughout Latin American and suggests that such poverty helps foster anti-American feeling in the region. Finally the film turns to Cuba, where we see people whose lives are being changed by Castro&#39;s regime, and also Castro addressing a protest rally of over one million people. The Declaration of Havana was made at this meeting, denouncing the Declaration of San Jose.

With magnificant photography and haunting sound track, the film captures the first explorer&#39;s phantasmagoric experience. The film begins before the encounter with the stunning sequence of an Anerindian tribe going about their daily activities. Each shot means meant to distance disorient the viewers, compelling us to decipher each action, much as the conquistadors may have done.

No word is spoken; it is a silent adventure, except for the strange and ominous sounds of the jungle. Viewers are not encouraged to identify with these strange , rather bizarre yet solorful individuals. Toward the end of the film, it becomes clear that the entire experience of the Europeans has been filmed from the point of a Yanomami shaman in a drug induced trance.

This film goes beyond national borders to remind us of  the plight of disappeared persons everywhere.

TITLE: LOS MINEROS  AUTHOR: Galan Productions  IMPRINT: PBS Video, 1991  PHYSICAL FEATURES: VIDEOCASSETTE 1991  Call Number: VCA 2019  Summary: This documentary from the American Experience series meshes archival  footage, letters and personal testimony to recount the battle of los mineros,  the fifty year struggle of Mexican- American miners to form a union. At the  turn of the century, two Arizona towns recruited Mexican men to labor in the  copper mines that supplied the raw material for electric power lines. The  foremen delegated the most dangerous tasks to the addition, they were forced  to live in shacks on the Mexican side of town and were cheated in company  stores. As early as 1903, the Mexicans were deported to Mexico as part of  a government&#39;s repatriation plan. With the recovery of the mines in the mid-1930&#39;s,  Mexican miners were permitted to return but found the dual wage system still  firmly entrenched. The Mexican Union was finally formed during World War II,  but wasn&#39;t recovered until 1946, when a 104 day strike led by the Mexican-American  world war II veterans ended in victory.

CLACS has a consortial arrangement with Columbia University's Institute for Iberian and Latin American Studies     which includes the cross-registration of students, joint summer institutes and joint public events.    The Center integrates the resources of New York University for the study of inter-American affairs, stressing the study of contemporary relations--    the emerging social, cultural, economic, and political links between and among the Americas.    The future priorities of CLACS include strengthening and expanding programs in Caribbean Studies, and the development of closer ties with the professional schools.            The collection also supports Latin American and Caribbean area studies course concentrations for doctoral programs in anthropology, cinema studies,     comparative literature, business administration, economics, history, politics, sociology, and Spanish and Portuguese languages and literatures.            Increasingly, in recent years, the collection has developed in response to the needs of issue based, inter-disciplinary studies and closer interaction between CLACS and the professional schools.    Issue based structures within FAS and/or GSAS include departments or programs in Africana Studies, Ethnographic Film and Video, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Metropolitan Studies, Peace and Global Policy Studies, and Women's Studies.    Recent global issues attracting cross-disciplinary interest and transnational perspectives include cultural studies, human rights, urban life, migration studies, environmental studies, post-colonial studies and communication studies.    Several Centers will be the focus of significant future, on-campus trends in cross-disciplinary research and teaching:    1) The King Juan Carlos I Center for the Study of Spain and the Spanish-speaking world ;    2) the Center for Media, Culture, and History; and    3) the NYU Institutes for Advanced International Studies.        Departmental interests are as follows:               History           Latin American and Caribbean history from 1492 to the present.     All countries are of interest for historical research and course work; emphasis has, historically been on Brazil and the Caribbean.     Recent interests include the Andean region and the African Diaspora.                    Politics           Political institutions, development, reform, revolution; U.S. corporate and governmental policy; common markets and collective trading groups;     urban politics; Latin American and Caribbean migration to the U.S. and Western Europe, and communities of Latin American and Caribbean nationals in the U.S. and Western Europe;     emphasis is on the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico.

Scope               Language           Materials are acquired in Spanish, English, Portuguese, and, more selectively, French, German and Dutch.     Codices, grammars, etc. of indigenous languages are acquired very selectively.     English translations of titles in languages not collected are acquired when available and of scholarly interest.                    Geographical Areas           All countries of Latin America and the Caribbean region are covered, although research trends and political events intensify collection effort for particular countries or regions at given times.     Geographical areas emphasized are Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Central America.     Latin American and Caribbean communities in the United States and Western Europe are of interest for migration and ethnic studies;     emphasis is on the Caribbean diaspora.                    Chronological Periods           Emphasis is on all historical periods from European conquest to the present.     The pre-Columbian period is of more limited interest in the Departments of Anthropology and History, and resources covering this period are acquired more selectively.                              Types of Materials               Included           Monographs, monographic series, serials, proceedings, facsimiles, microforms, videos, music recordings, electronic media, multi-media, and Internet resources.     Government documents, atlases, dissertations, scores, working papers, pamphlets, and ephemera are acquired on a more selective basis.                    Excluded      Maps, textbooks and juvenilia.                          Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Collection development for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses primarily on the history, politics, international relations, social and economic conditions, literatures and languages of Latin America and the Caribbean. Historically, the strengths of the collection are literature and the political, economic and social history of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Collecting is stronger in the humanities than in the social sciences.    The collection coverage for individual authors, literary criticism and literary movements is very good. The contemporary Brazilian fiction and poetry collection is noteworthy and serves as a resource for scholars throughout the metropolitan area. The collection in Caribbean history and literature, all language areas and the diaspora is steadily becoming a noteworthy collection. The audio-visual collection is nationally unique. Areas of relatively recent scholarly interest at NYU are currently being developed and strengthened: art, music, business, popular culture, migration studies, environmental studies and women's studies.    In 1982, the library started to implement blanket order acquisition plans with Latin American vendors. These plans currently cover Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Central America, Mexico, and the British Caribbean. Under the terms of these plans current imprints from various Latin American countries are automatically received at Bobst Library. These agreements have dramatically improved the coverage and timeliness of current imprints. The blanket order shipments are considerably augmented by firm orders generated by dealers' catalogs, publishers' catalogs, library acquistions' lists, bibliographies and review media.    The Business and Social Science/Documents Center hold many important resources for social science research on Latin America and the Caribbean. The United Nations and International Governmental Organizations Collection receives on deposit or standing order, the publications of the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America, the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labor Office and the International Council for Migration. Most of these government documents do not appear in BobCat. The Center also has extensive microform collections covering historical and current socio-economic statistics.    The library offers a wide range of electronic resources, including remote and in-library access to the the Hispanic American Periodicals Index (HAPI), LADB (Latin American Database) and the Handbook of Latin American Studies (HLAS). The Library offers a wide range of commercial databases which contain Latin American information, including PAIS, the MLA Bibliography, F&amp;S International, Ethnic Newswatch, and Dissertation Abstracts. The Library also has a Latin American Studies Resources Homepage . Multi-media, electronic text and electronic data on CD-ROM are collected very selectively. and, strategically, Since January 1993, the library has offered the academic community Latin American newsbroadcasts via satellite through SCOLA. SCOLA programming is available for viewing in the library as well as at other locations around the University where NYU-TV broadcasting is available. SCOLA programs may be recorded off-air for use in classrooms or by individual researchers.    Some of the collection weaknesses are as follows:        government publications, except for population census material and statistical abstracts. The library relies on holdings at New York Public Library and LAMP . This will not change unless we agree to cooperate regionally.        serials in general. There are historical gaps in history and literature which are impossible to fill, unless microform copies can be identified for purchase. Current subscriptiohns have been added on a very selective basis for the past ten years due to budgetary constraints.        current news sources. The cost and difficulty of acquiring and processing newspapers and newsmagazines have resulted in limited holdings. In addition to the limited holdings the library relies on newspaper clipping services, the Latin American Newsletters, Global Newsbank, LADB, FBIS, and SCOLA. The library is currently working on a regional cooperative collecting agreement.        Newspaper backfiles. The library currently relies on news clipping services, FBIS, regional holdings, CRL and LAMP . The library is considering adding a limited number of backfiles based on regional gaps, and cooperative collection agreements. So far the library has added Uno m&aacute;s Uno.        current social and economic statistics. The library relies on the statistical publications of international organizations and a selection of Latin American statistical publications available on microform. The statistics are reported in these sources with two to three delays. The library may need to consider adding a selection of statistical abstracts in paper.        preservation problems have contributed to the gaps in the library's Latin American collection. New titles from Latin America and the Caribbean are printed on poor quality paper which does not withstand heavy use and aging. The library is addressing the problem by routinely binding new material, and replacing brittle material with microfilm copy.        Pre-1950 imprints. Retrospective collection assessment and development is a constant necessity to identify and, if possible fill lacunae. Important retrospective material is often reprinted, re-published in new editions, or microfilmed. It is very difficult, and, usually too costly to purchase and preserve original editions.                     Resource Sharing      Numerous and complex factors such as the proliferation of research materials, lack of sufficient acquisitions funds and the physical deterioration of large portions of the collection have forced research libraries to recognize their inability to be entirely self-sufficient, and the need to rely on cooperative collection development and user referrals to other collections. Coordinated resource sharing makes it possible to offer Latin American scholars in the region, and specifically at New York University, a wider range of research material.     The logical and most important coordinating partner is Columbia University Libraries. In 1988 the two institutions established a Consortium for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, which has stimulated frequent contact between the bibliographers to coordinate, among other things, respective collection development policies. The two bibliographers actively develop collaborative projects that will increase the breadth and depth of Latin American holdings in the New York metropolitan area. Examples of formal agreements include sharing coverage of Latin American and Caribbean 2nd tier women writers; migrant communities in Europe; and Latin American Recorded Popular Music. Major purchasing, such as the recent acquisition of the  Author Catalogues of the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid  and the  Archivo Biogr&aacute;fico de Espa&ntilde;a, Portugal e Iberoam&eacute;rica,  is done collaboratively.     As participating member of the  Latin American Northeast Library Consortium (LANE)  , the Latin American Bibliographer meets with colleagues in the Northeast twice a year to discuss collection development issues. The other participating bibliographers are from NYPL, Columbia Univ. Rutgers Univ., Univ. Of Connecticut at Storrs, Univ. Of Mass., Univ. Of Pittsburg, Princeton Univ., Univ. of Pennsylvannia, Yale Univ., Brown Univ., Cornell Univ., and Harvard Univ. LANE is currently planning to coordinate, jointly identify and/or broaden the coverage of 1) current newspaper and newsweekly subscriptions; 2) historical backfiles of newspapers and newsweeklies; 3) financial statistical sources; 4) videos from and/or about Latin America; 5) business news sources; 6) telephone books; and 7) major microform sets.     The LANE group complements and extends the work of the Latin American Microform Project (LAMP) , of which Bobst Library is a subscribing member. LAMP was founded in 1975 for the purpose of making available to scholars Latin American research materials in microformat, which would otherwise be unavailable. This includes materials which are inaccessible, in poor condition, or beyond the economic means of an individual institution. There are currently 33 member libraries, all of which have borrowing privileges for LAMP material housed at CRL's facilities. A meeting to report on projects-in-progress and to propose new projects is held once a year at SALALM .     Bobst Library's membership in the Center for Research Librarires is crucial for access to foreign dissertations; newspaper backfiles; British Foreign Office Microform Sets; and State Dept. Microform Sets.     The Library is a participant in the Latin American Demonstration Project of the AAU/ARL Global Resources Program together with 34 other libraries. Our participation requires 1) a commitment to provide access to selected Mexican and Argentine journals by maintaining subscriptions, providing timely ILL, and supplying contents pages for a journal database; and 2) A $7,000 comitment to Latin American Art Exhibit Catalogs.
