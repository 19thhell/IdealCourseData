Sagan introduced a generation of readers and television viewers to a romantic, awe-filled vision of the universe. He explained that we were literally stardust, and let ordinary people inhabit the excitement of the exploration of space. Through\u00a0 The Tonight Show \u00a0and\u00a0 Cosmos \u00a0, he became a fixture of the American home. But Sagan was also censured by his colleagues for his work to popularize science, even as he vigorously patrolled the borders of science against those who fell short of professional stature. And while he gained fame by trying to communicate with aliens, he used that fame to warn against the dangers of nuclear war and environmental destruction. We will read works by Sagan, including\u00a0 Cosmos \u00a0and its companion television program,\u00a0 Dragons of Eden \u00a0,\u00a0 Murmurs of Earth \u00a0,\u00a0 The Demon Haunted World \u00a0, and\u00a0 The Cold and the Dark \u00a0. These sources will be supplemented with theoretical work on the rhetoric and philosophy of science.

Sagan introduced a generation of readers and television viewers to a romantic, awe-filled vision of the universe. He explained that we were literally stardust, and let ordinary people inhabit the excitement of the exploration of space. Through\u00a0 The Tonight Show \u00a0and\u00a0 Cosmos \u00a0, he became a fixture of the American home. But Sagan was also censured by his colleagues for his work to popularize science, even as he vigorously patrolled the borders of science against those who fell short of professional stature. And while he gained fame by trying to communicate with aliens, he used that fame to warn against the dangers of nuclear war and environmental destruction. We will read works by Sagan, including\u00a0 Cosmos \u00a0and its companion television program,\u00a0 Dragons of Eden \u00a0,\u00a0 Murmurs of Earth \u00a0,\u00a0 The Demon Haunted World \u00a0, and\u00a0 The Cold and the Dark \u00a0. These sources will be supplemented with theoretical work on the rhetoric and philosophy of science.

He holds degrees in astronomy, religion, physics, and the history of science and is interested in the connections between science and the wider culture. He is the author of\u00a0 Practical Mystic: Religion, Science, and A. S.

His current project is a history of scientific predictions of the end of the world. Professor Stanley is also part of a nationwide NSF-funded effort to use the humanities to improve science education in the college classroom. He has held fellowships at the Institute for Advanced Study, the British Academy, and the Max Planck Institute. He currently runs the New York City History of Science Working Group.

Sagan introduced a generation of readers and television viewers to a romantic, awe-filled vision of the universe. He explained that we were literally stardust, and let ordinary people inhabit the excitement of the exploration of space. Through\u00a0 The Tonight Show \u00a0and\u00a0 Cosmos \u00a0, he became a fixture of the American home. But Sagan was also censured by his colleagues for his work to popularize science, even as he vigorously patrolled the borders of science against those who fell short of professional stature. And while he gained fame by trying to communicate with aliens, he used that fame to warn against the dangers of nuclear war and environmental destruction. We will read works by Sagan, including\u00a0 Cosmos \u00a0and its companion television program,\u00a0 Dragons of Eden \u00a0,\u00a0 Murmurs of Earth \u00a0,\u00a0 The Demon Haunted World \u00a0, and\u00a0 The Cold and the Dark \u00a0. These sources will be supplemented with theoretical work on the rhetoric and philosophy of science.
