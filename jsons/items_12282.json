These courses are designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of these courses is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.

Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.    Atlantic World    Literature of the Field: Atlantic World HIST-GA 2001 4 points. 2013-14. Introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for Atlantic history.    Empires, States and Political Imagination HIST-GA 3390 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Focuses on the comparative study of empires from the Romans to the present and on the variety of ways in which empire-states have established and constrained claims to rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our debates over rights, citizenship, economic regulation, and accountability without letting them fall into a seeming gap between the nation-state and the global.    Political Cultures of Empire HIST-GA 2861 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Provides the opportunity for closely advised research and writing on student- designed projects related to the history of empires. The course builds on readings and discussion in the reading course Empires, States, and Political Imagination (HIST-GA 3390).

By the end of the semester, each student will have produced a major research paper based on primary sources in the format of an article to be published in an academic journal.    Atlantic History Workshop HIST-GA 3803 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This yearlong course overlaps with the Atlantic History Workshop colloquium, which meets regularly in the Department of History throughout the academic year. At the colloquium, participants discuss pre-circulated works-in-progress presented by visiting scholars or members of the colloquium. Students enrolled in this course attend every meeting of the colloquium and undertake additional activities assigned by the instructor.

Problems in the History of Early Modern China HIST-GA 1919 4 points. 2014-15. This reading-intensive colloquium on early modern China is intended for those who are already familiar with the outlines of early modern Chinese history. Participants will both engage in greater depth some of the major paradigms in Chinese history c. 1550-1900 and will gain a broad knowledge of recent historiographical debates.    Medieval Europe    Literature of the Field: Middle Ages HIST-GA 2113 4 points. 2014-15. This course provides an introduction to the literature of medieval history for the period c. 1050-1400, as that literature has evolved over the last century, with a focus on changes in the methodology of medieval historiography, the approach to primary texts and the shifting interests that have characterized medieval scholarship in the modern context.    Byzantium and the West HIST-GA 1156 4 points. 2013-14. This seminar will explore the relations between the two heirs of Rome, Byzantium and Western Europe, from the initial division of the empire in the fourth century to the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans.    Historical Anthropology of the Middle Ages HIST-GA 1115 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-2015.    Rulers And The Ruled In Imperial Rome And The Byzantium HIST-GA.1125 2013-2014. With an astonishingly long life span, extending from Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages in the Byzantine East, the Roman Empire left a legacy of political and legal organization that has shaped the modern world. This seminar explores, on the one hand, the representation and exercise of imperial power and, on the other, the way the emperor's subjects perceived their position within the system and experienced authority, official or not. We will investigate imperial legitimacy building, political discourse, consensus and opposition, negotiation and concessions to the powerful, local government and justice, corruption, oppression and patronage, as well as the social groupings and networks that afforded some leverage to the less powerful.    Europe    Literature of the Field: Early Modern Europe HIST-GA 1150 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the early modern field.    Literature of the Field: Modern Europe HIST-GA 1151 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. Survey of the major literature and historiographical issues in the modern European field.    European Intellectual History HIST-GA 1193 4 points. 2014-15. Interplays the specific cultural-historical context of interwar Europe (in particular France in the late Third Republic and Weimar Germany, but also to a lesser extent Austria, Italy, and early Soviet Russia) with trends of philosophical, literary, and political writing of the period. Certain themes or figures guide the choice of texts, e.g., authority, subjectivity, violence, sovereignty.    The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective HIST-GA 3901 4 points. 2014-15. This course will focus on war and civil war in the twentieth-century Mediterranean. We will compare and contrast the experiences of Spain, Greece and Italy, as well as of other countries of Southern Europe, and analyze how the legacy of civil war has contributed to shaping contemporary national identities. This course will address major methodological questions concerning how we understand war and civil war in the fields of history and social sciences. We will also discuss the peculiarity, if any, of civil wars in the Mediterranean, in relation to the wider historical context of twentieth-century Europe.    Italian Colonialism and Postcolonialism HIST-GA 2972 4 points. 2014-15. Explores Italian colonialism from the late 19th century through the end of empire. Through readings of travel literature, films, and historical works, we address the meaning of colonialism within Italian history and culture, colonial racial policies and gender identities, and the legacies of colonialism in Italy and in its former colonies.    Russian Cultural History HIST-GA 1330 4 points. 2014-15. This course looks at \"culture\" in an expansive way, examining recent scholarship on mapping, settlement, and territorial expansion, on laws and courts, on empire and religion, love and power, property and markets, gender, family, friendship, social science and art in Russia from the 17th through the 20th century. We will look at different groups in the empire's population--peasants in imperial and post-Soviet times, nobles, one empress and her advisor/lover, Muslims, various nationalities, Soviet officials, workers, and youth and at the linkages among them and to the state.    The Ottoman 17th Century HIST-GA 3503 4 points. 2013-14. The course emphasizes religious and intellectual over political developments, although the continuing importance of patronage as a cultural and political dynamic is stressed as a process linking all these domains. It also aims at highlighting varied communal and social experiences as well as inter-communal relations over imperial or state-oriented policies and programs.    The Ottoman Empire in Europe HIST-GA.1651 4 points. 2013-14.    The Politics of Language in Early Modern and Modern Italy HIST-GA 1981 4 points. 2014-15.    Modern European Cities HIST-GA 1203 4 points. 2014-15. This colloquium examines recent scholarship in European urban history. It includes cities from Barcelona to Moscow, and ranges widely over the 19th and 20th centuries, but its ultimate goal is not to \"cover\" particular cities or themes so much as to introduce major works and approaches from the previous decade. What issues are energizing European urban history? How do these issues relate to broader developments in historiography and the humanities? In what ways does urban history contribute something distinctive to these conversations?    19th Century France HIST-GA 1209 4 points. 2014-15. Explores the transformation of France from the Old Regime monarchy of the late eighteenth century to the early Third Republic of the 1870s. We will focus first on the French Revolution, its origins, dynamics and consequences. We will then study the political, social, and cultural conflicts that help explain why the French went through three more revolutions--in 1830, 1848, and 1871--before establishing a stable form of republican government. We will also devote time to social and cultural history, and especially to recent literature on working-class formation, gender relations, and the peasantry.    History of Modern Ireland HIST-GA.1416 2013-14.    Latin America and the Caribbean    Literature of the Field: Colonial Latin America HIST-GA 1200 4 points. 2012-13.

A reading course covering the earlier period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.    Literature of the Field: US Since 1877 HIST-GA 1610 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. A reading course covering the later period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.    Transnational Approaches to US History HIST-GA 1739 4 points. 2014-15. This course will explore recent developments in historiography that seek ways of understanding a national history\u2014U.S. History in this case\u2014in a framework larger than the nation. There are different transnational framings, different in type and scale, but Diasporas and Borderlands, Atlantic World, and Global are at present the most vigorous, and the focus will be mainly on them.    Black New York HIST-GA 2551 4 points. 2014-15. This course will explore the under-engaged topic of blacks in New York from its Dutch origins to the present. The process of racial formation and the mechanisms of racial domination in the early stages of the settlement were central to the northern colonial experience and to the founding of the United States.    Race, Civil War, and Reconstruction HIST-GA 1607 4 points. 2013-14.
