NYU Student Health Center (SHC)    726 Broadway, 3rd and 4th floors  212-443-1000   www.nyu.edu/shc   health.center@nyu.edu   At the SHC, here are some of the ways that we strive to make our services more accessible to transgender students.     Services   Services that are typically gendered can be provided in alternate departments. For example, if you do not feel comfortable having a gynecological exam in Women\u2019s Health Services, you can request to have one done in the Primary Care Services department.     Hormone Therapy   The SHC can prescribe hormone therapy, according to standards of care. The standard procedure is to make an appointment with Primary Care Services and get a referral to see an endocrinologist.

Also be sure to check out the NYU Transgender Health Brochure.   NYU Student Health Center (SHC)    726 Broadway, 3rd and 4th floors  212-443-1000   www.nyu.edu/shc   health.center@nyu.edu   At the SHC, here are some of the ways that we strive to make our services more accessible to transgender students.     Services   Services that are typically gendered can be provided in alternate departments. For example, if you do not feel comfortable having a gynecological exam in Women\u2019s Health Services, you can request to have one done in the Primary Care Services department.     Hormone Therapy   The SHC can prescribe hormone therapy, according to standards of care. The standard procedure is to make an appointment with Primary Care Services and get a referral to see an endocrinologist. We can also monitor hormone treatments, even if a health care provider outside of the SHC system prescribes your hormones.     HIV Testing and Counseling   Appointments: 212-443-1122   Confidential HIV testing and counseling is available at no charge for all NYU students. The services include pre-test and post-test counseling by a Safe Zone trained provider, and the results are available in two days.     Social Services   212-443-1135   Social Services are free to all NYU students regardless of insurance. A certified social worker is available to assist with a variety of emotional, medical, and financial issues including crisis intervention, sexual or domestic violence, chronic health problems, and assistance with alternative or low cost medical care.     Wellness Exchange 24/7 Hotline     212-443-9999   The Wellness Exchange is your key to accessing NYU's extensive health and mental health resources. A central feature common to all these services is a private, 24/7 hotline that puts students in touch with professionals who can help them address day-to-day challenges as well as other health-related concerns.    Health Promotion Office  726 Broadway, Suite 344  212-443-1234   health.promotion@nyu.edu   Health Promotion &amp; Wellness Services at the Student Health Center is a free, non-judgmental, confidential place for information, conversation and referrals about health-related topics including general health and safety, HIV/AIDS, sexual health, sexual harassment and assault, LGBT issues, nutrition, stress management, smoking cessation, body image, and contraception. All our staff members are Safe Zone trained.   Counseling &amp; Wellness Services    726 Broadway, Suite 471  212-998-4780   www.nyu.edu/counseling | wellness.exchange@nyu.edu     Counseling &amp; Behavioral Health Services are free of charge for all NYU students, regardless of their insurance. Students are eligible to receive short-term individual counseling, group counseling, and referrals for long-term psychotherapy.    The Gender &amp; Sexuality team is an interdisciplinary group of providers from the Student Health Center who work together to provide and improve health and mental healthcare for transgendered and gender nonconforming students.These therapists are both &quot;out&quot; counselors and safe zone members on staff able who are trained to address LGBTQ related issues.  Counseling &amp; Behavioral Health Services also has a counselor who serves as a liaison to the LGBTQ community: Brooke Donatone . When making an appointment, a request can be made to meet with this counselor , or any person from the Gender &amp; Sexuality team simply mentioning her name or the team at the time of scheduling.
