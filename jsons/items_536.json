Sample Syllabus                                  Anthropology                                                  Roma in Central East Europe: Enthnographic and Historical Overview Of A People Without A State - ANTH-UA 9200 - 4 points                               The course will introduce students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority through to the emergence of Romany organizations with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The course begins with the pre-Romanesque and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism periods. The major focus will be on 19th and 20th Century architectural styles from Historicism and Art Nouveau through Cubism, Art-D\u00e9co, Avant-garde Functionalism, post-war Stalinist art and architecture, and the contemporary. It's necessary to have an understanding of the evolution of Mid European art and architecture, town planning and theory.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Czech Art and Architecture - ARTH-UA\u00a09662 - 4 points                               This course presents a survey of art and architecture in Prague and its environs - from the Middle Ages to the present - placed within the context of the main periods and movements of Western art history. The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

During the semester, students focus on the strategic implications of communication for modern organizations. A variety of assignments are given to stress the following communication competencies: written, spoken and nonverbal communication basics for business; effective team communication strategies; informative, persuasive and collaborative presentations; communication techniques for required junior and senior year projects. Students regularly receive personal feedback about their writing and their oral presentations from instructors and staff.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies -\u00a0ECON-UB 9271 - 3 points                               Prerequisites: ECON-UB 1, ECON-UA 10 or ECON-UA 11, Intermediate Microeconomics or Microeconomics (Theory). or equivalent.   NYU Stern students may take this course as a third Stern course at NYU Prague.   NYU College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department Students: Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit.   The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.   Sample syllabus                                  College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Russia - Between East &amp; West - CORE-UA 9510 - 4 points                               Russia\u2019s rich and multifaced cultural identity has been shaped in a thousand year long process of interaction with a range of diverse cultural formations of the \u2018West\u2019 and \u2018East\u2019 (including Byzantine/ Christian \u2018East\u2019, Central Asian/Muslim \u2018East\u2019, South Asian/Indian \u2018East\u201d, and East Asian/Confucian \u2018East\u2019). For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.   Sample syllabus                              Economics        Ownership and Corporate Control in Advanced and Transition Economies is now offered through the Stern School of Business's Economics Department.

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.

The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Imagining America, Imagining Europe-\u00a0EURO-UA 9173 - 4 points                               This class is devoted not only to a &quot;close reading&quot; of the selected texts, but also to relevant broader issues. While the approach and methods are interdisciplinary, the main emphasis is on literary theory (explaining and applying basic literary terms), literary history (both American and European), and literary criticism (analyzing different responses to given works). Every class starts with the oral presentation delivered by a student, then there is a short lecture by the teacher, and a discussion follows.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.

Students will consider numerous issues of city planning and growth. Topics will include patterns of cultural distinctiveness, the influence of ethnic and religious concerns, and the political implications apparent in architectural design, neighborhood development, housing policies, and public space.   Sample syllabus                                                                    History of Nationalism in Central and Eastern Europe -\u00a0HIST-UA 9176 - 4 points                               In the 20th Century, three phenomena had fateful consequences for Central and Eastern Europe: (1) the unsuccessful attempt to eliminate, after WWI, national tension by creating new nation-states, and the encounters with both major totalitarian ideologies, (2) Nazism and (3) Communism. The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Several forms and techniques will be explored through lecture, discussion and assignments, including: news reports, interviews, reviews (film, literature, theater), feature stories, essays, and commentaries. During the course, students will learn not only about Prague's cultural landscape but they will be encouraged to examine it in various journalistic and literary forms. One of the leading aims of this courses is also to introduce to them six extraordinary persons, whose work in their respective areas reached international attention.   Sample syllabus                                                                    International Reporting (Elective Topics) -\u00a0JOUR-UA\u00a09204 - 4 points                               This course will focus on foreign reporting in US and British newspapers and journals, looking at the history of foreign reporting, the different kinds of media in which it appears, the topics it covers and the skills necessary to perform it. Students will read and discuss contemporary reporting and famous reportage from the past, listen to foreign correspondents and write their own stories. By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of foreign reporting and will be well equipped with some of the practical skills necessary to follow it as a career.

Global Media Seminar: East-Central Europe - JOUR-UA 9505 and MCC-UE 9453 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

Students will read, watch, analyze and discuss a variety of text specific commercials. Attention will be devoted also to the impact of advertising on the post-communist world and to the ways by which cultural issues are framed and kept in mind in the media discourse. The main objective is to provide an introductory course that is meaningful and of practical importance to students. The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.

Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes \u201csocial media.\u201d We will also work from an expansive definition of \u201ctechnology,\u201d considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life.

Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

Politics                                                  East European Government and\u00a0Politics - POL-UA 9522 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to the modern politics and government of Central and Eastern Europe from the beginning of the Twentieth Century to the present. We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.   Sample syllabus                                                                    European-American Relations in the 21st Century - POL-UA\u00a09598 - 4 points                               This course explores the recent history and the current state of political, economic and cultural relations between the United States and Europe. Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Czech and Slovak Modern History in the Central European Context - POL-UA\u00a09994 - 4 points                               This course tells the story of the region in the geographical trap between Germany and Russia. The establishment of Czechoslovakia, the post-WW II expulsion of the German minority, Stalinism, the Prague Spring of 1968, dissident movements, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, transition to democracy, V\u00e1clav Havel and the post-Havel era will all be studied. Students will gain basic knowledge on Central European political, historical and economic issues. Critical reading of sources and independent thinking required.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Germany and East Central Europe (1871-2000) - HIST-UA9514 or POL-UA 9515 - 4 points                               This course will focus on the history of the culturally rich region of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; through analysis of the parallel evolution of Germany and the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                              Religious Studies                                                  Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe -\u00a0RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points                               Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.   Sample syllabus                                Russian and Slavic Studies                                                    Contemporary Central and East European Literature: From Kafka to Kundera -\u00a0RUSSN-UA 9832 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is not to bring a full and detailed picture of the whole of modern and contemporary Central and East European literature into perspective, but rather to take advantage of the unique occasion to offer students a more focused view. Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.   Sample syllabus                              Sociology                                                  Collective Identity in a Totalitarian Regime -\u00a0SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course examines the totalitarian oppression from the point of view of ordinary citizens in communist Czechoslovakia. It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Contemporary Issues in Law: Law and Human Rights in Central Europe - SOC-UA 9413 - 4 points                               This course explores the development of the rule of law and human rights issues in post-communist Central Europe. We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

Sample Syllabus                                  Anthropology                                                  Roma in Central East Europe: Enthnographic and Historical Overview Of A People Without A State - ANTH-UA 9200 - 4 points                               The course will introduce students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority through to the emergence of Romany organizations with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The course begins with the pre-Romanesque and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism periods. The major focus will be on 19th and 20th Century architectural styles from Historicism and Art Nouveau through Cubism, Art-D\u00e9co, Avant-garde Functionalism, post-war Stalinist art and architecture, and the contemporary. It's necessary to have an understanding of the evolution of Mid European art and architecture, town planning and theory.

The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

During the semester, students focus on the strategic implications of communication for modern organizations. A variety of assignments are given to stress the following communication competencies: written, spoken and nonverbal communication basics for business; effective team communication strategies; informative, persuasive and collaborative presentations; communication techniques for required junior and senior year projects. Students regularly receive personal feedback about their writing and their oral presentations from instructors and staff.

NYU Stern students may take this course as a third Stern course at NYU Prague.   NYU College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department Students: Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit.   The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.   Sample syllabus                                  College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Russia - Between East &amp; West - CORE-UA 9510 - 4 points                               Russia\u2019s rich and multifaced cultural identity has been shaped in a thousand year long process of interaction with a range of diverse cultural formations of the \u2018West\u2019 and \u2018East\u2019 (including Byzantine/ Christian \u2018East\u2019, Central Asian/Muslim \u2018East\u2019, South Asian/Indian \u2018East\u201d, and East Asian/Confucian \u2018East\u2019). For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.   Sample syllabus                                Comparative Literature                                                  Kafka and his Contexts - COLIT-UA 9136 and SASEM-UG 9401 - 4 points                               &quot;A book must be an ax for the frozen sea in us,&quot; wrote Franz Kafka (1883-1924), one of the best known but least understood authors of our times. In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit by students in NYU's College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department.                    European &amp; Mediterranean Studies                                                  European Security after the Cold War -\u00a0EURO-UA 9157 - 4 points                               This course will try to put European security into the context of today\u2019s world: from the collapse of communism and dissolution of the Warsaw Pact through the years of wars in the former Yugoslavia, the wars on former Soviet territory, and to the stateless threat of terrorism today. But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Imagining America, Imagining Europe-\u00a0EURO-UA 9173 - 4 points                               This class is devoted not only to a &quot;close reading&quot; of the selected texts, but also to relevant broader issues. While the approach and methods are interdisciplinary, the main emphasis is on literary theory (explaining and applying basic literary terms), literary history (both American and European), and literary criticism (analyzing different responses to given works). Every class starts with the oral presentation delivered by a student, then there is a short lecture by the teacher, and a discussion follows.   Sample syllabus                              Film and Television                                                    Seminar in Czech Cinema - IFMTV-UT 1040 - 4 points                               Emphasizing one of the most influential film movements in the post-World War II era, the cinema of the Czech New Wave. This cinema studies course explores the history and development of Czech and Slovak cinema. Lectures are supplemented with screenings.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.   Sample syllabus                              Hebrew and Judaic Studies                                                  Modern Jewish History - HBRJD-UA 9103 - 4 points                               One hundred and fifty years ago all Jews had three things in common: every Jew prayed in Hebrew, he submitted to God\u2018s commandments and awaited the coming of the Messiah. Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.   Sample syllabus                                History                                                  The Cultural History of the City in Central Europe: Prague, Budapest, Vienna and Berlin -\u00a0HIST-UA 9091 - 4 points                               The process of urbanization in the modern era has reflected the economic differences, the social and aesthetic customs, and the political nuances of the European nations and of Europe as a whole. Students will consider numerous issues of city planning and growth. Topics will include patterns of cultural distinctiveness, the influence of ethnic and religious concerns, and the political implications apparent in architectural design, neighborhood development, housing policies, and public space.   Sample syllabus                                                                    History of Nationalism in Central and Eastern Europe -\u00a0HIST-UA 9176 - 4 points                               In the 20th Century, three phenomena had fateful consequences for Central and Eastern Europe: (1) the unsuccessful attempt to eliminate, after WWI, national tension by creating new nation-states, and the encounters with both major totalitarian ideologies, (2) Nazism and (3) Communism. The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Several forms and techniques will be explored through lecture, discussion and assignments, including: news reports, interviews, reviews (film, literature, theater), feature stories, essays, and commentaries. During the course, students will learn not only about Prague's cultural landscape but they will be encouraged to examine it in various journalistic and literary forms. One of the leading aims of this courses is also to introduce to them six extraordinary persons, whose work in their respective areas reached international attention.   Sample syllabus                                                                    International Reporting (Elective Topics) -\u00a0JOUR-UA\u00a09204 - 4 points                               This course will focus on foreign reporting in US and British newspapers and journals, looking at the history of foreign reporting, the different kinds of media in which it appears, the topics it covers and the skills necessary to perform it. Students will read and discuss contemporary reporting and famous reportage from the past, listen to foreign correspondents and write their own stories. By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of foreign reporting and will be well equipped with some of the practical skills necessary to follow it as a career.

Global Media Seminar: East-Central Europe - JOUR-UA 9505 and MCC-UE 9453 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.   Sample syllabus                              Law and Society                                                    Topics in Law and Society: Society and the Philosophy of Law -\u00a0LWSOC-UA 9251- 4 points                               This course will begin by reviewing the nature and sources of law. Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

Students will read, watch, analyze and discuss a variety of text specific commercials. Attention will be devoted also to the impact of advertising on the post-communist world and to the ways by which cultural issues are framed and kept in mind in the media discourse. The main objective is to provide an introductory course that is meaningful and of practical importance to students. The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Social Media Networking - MCC-UE 9032 - 4 points                               This course will examine \u201csocial media\u201d from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes \u201csocial media.\u201d We will also work from an expansive definition of \u201ctechnology,\u201d considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Media and Cultural Analysis -\u00a0MCC-UE 9014 - 4 points                               An introduction to the theoretical approaches and practices used to analyze the content, structure, and context of media in society. Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.   Sample syllabus                                                                    European-American Relations in the 21st Century - POL-UA\u00a09598 - 4 points                               This course explores the recent history and the current state of political, economic and cultural relations between the United States and Europe. Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Czech and Slovak Modern History in the Central European Context - POL-UA\u00a09994 - 4 points                               This course tells the story of the region in the geographical trap between Germany and Russia. The establishment of Czechoslovakia, the post-WW II expulsion of the German minority, Stalinism, the Prague Spring of 1968, dissident movements, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, transition to democracy, V\u00e1clav Havel and the post-Havel era will all be studied. Students will gain basic knowledge on Central European political, historical and economic issues. Critical reading of sources and independent thinking required.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Germany and East Central Europe (1871-2000) - HIST-UA9514 or POL-UA 9515 - 4 points                               This course will focus on the history of the culturally rich region of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; through analysis of the parallel evolution of Germany and the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                              Religious Studies                                                  Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe -\u00a0RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points                               Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.   Sample syllabus                                Russian and Slavic Studies                                                    Contemporary Central and East European Literature: From Kafka to Kundera -\u00a0RUSSN-UA 9832 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is not to bring a full and detailed picture of the whole of modern and contemporary Central and East European literature into perspective, but rather to take advantage of the unique occasion to offer students a more focused view. Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.   Sample syllabus                              Sociology                                                  Collective Identity in a Totalitarian Regime -\u00a0SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course examines the totalitarian oppression from the point of view of ordinary citizens in communist Czechoslovakia. It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Contemporary Issues in Law: Law and Human Rights in Central Europe - SOC-UA 9413 - 4 points                               This course explores the development of the rule of law and human rights issues in post-communist Central Europe. We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

The objective is not   just to enhance understanding and appreciation of literature and the skills   to analyze literature, but to see literature embedded within the entire global   spectrum, a useful exercise for non-majors in business, media, communication   and even health science. Students will be introduced to a wide range and depth   of material from all over the world and be asked to read and write critically and creatively on a weekly basis. It is just as important to have analyze the material closely, as it is to interact creatively with the literature. The point of alter ego monologues is to allow students   to enter another life subjectively as well as objectively, and to explore   a perspective and culture different from their own. Creative writing majors can prepare a portfolio deconstructing the literature, business, political and social science majors can design a project that explores the marriage between literature and their field of interest.     This course can also include classics like Aristotle's Poetics to analyze definitions of terror, the Apocalypse or Revelation section from the Bible, and Shakespearean plays such as Richard III.

Literature and Food, Literature and Sex/Love, Literature and Violence/Terrorism, Literature and Politics, Literature and Religion, Literature and Science, Literature and Business, Literature and Health, Literature and Sickness, Literature and the Environment   Literature and Life         HYBRID COURSE   We will analyze different kinds of narrative, comparing Arabic with British, American, Chinese, Iranian, Russian, Turkish, Greek and French, looking at cyclical, pass-the-ball, superimposed, step narratives, interior monologues, stream of consciousness, American straightforward plainspeak, multiple narrators, shifting points of view and time. We will analyze dramatic structure and show how Aristotle's Poetics has been transformed with twentieth century organic drama, screenwriting, ordinary world/special world paradigms and other innovative structures. Through oral interpretation of the texts we will analyze the musicality, phrasing, syntax, and vocabulary of the various authors.   Course Requirements: You must do   close textual analyses every other week uploaded to FILES for the cyberspace   sessions, creative writing alter ego monologues through the same books for   the meatspace sessions, and two oral presentations for the meatspace sessions,   including primary and secondary sources which will grow into an 8-10 page   final paper. The alter ego monologues will grow into an 8-16 page webfolio.   Grading: You will be given Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory   for the weekly assignments, but letter grades for the close textual analyses, oral presentations and   creative webfolios. The last day will involve a skit with role playing as   alter egos. The creative webfolios and oral presentations make up 50% of the   grade; participation, attendance, and WEEKLY assignments make up the other   50.   Method of Instruction:    Cyberspace Sessions will consist of uploading Close Textual Analyses   into FILES. Choose a passage, at least one page, from each book in that cluster,   write it out triple spaced; then analyse it in terms of language, vocabulary,   sentence structure, paragraph organization, figures of speech, rhythm, narrative   voice, characterization, relationship of dialogue to description, relationship   to plot, structure and rest of novel or play, cultural implications and other   extrinsic factors related to politics, philosophy, geography etc. Keep all   your analyses, usually three, in one document and upload to FILES. Cross edit   each other's work. We will have frequent discussions in the listserv about   the books, the analyses, and related topics.    Meatspace Sessions will consist of creative role playing based on monologues   you write in your character's voice, oral presentations on each of the authors,   viewing of pertinent audio-visual material, and discussion and lectures on   cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary issues related to the global literature.     Required Reading: Books are organized into seven clusters   for the meatspace classes. Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman is daily   meditation. Bring it to the first class. Clusters will be reworked with the addition of contemporary literature.   Cluster One: No Exit by Jean-Paul Sartre, The Plague by Albert   Camus,   Cluster Two :All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque,   Night by Elie Wiesel   Cluster Three: The Day The Leader Was Killed by Naguib Mahfouz, God   Dies by the Nile by Nawal el Saadawi, and War in the Land of Egypt   by Yusuf al-Qa'id, Un-clashing Civilizations by Julia Keefer, from How to Survive as an Adjunct Professor by Wrestling   Cluster Four: Wild Thorns by Sahar Khalifeh, Martyr's Crossing   by Amy Wilentz, Satanic Verses or Fury by Salman Rushdie   Cluster Five: Red Azalea by Anchee Min, Soul Mountain or One   Man's Bible by Gao Xingjian    Cluster Six:Mao II by Don DeLillo, News of a Kidnapping by Gabriel   Garcia Marquez, The Hostage by Zayd Mutee'Damaj, Black Water by Joyce Carol Oates   Attendance/Participation Policy: The professor is not in   a position to evaluate excuses so do not give her any. Weekly reading and   writing assignments are clearly listed. If you fall drastically behind, a   medically documented incomplete is possible but not recommended. Since you   can access this course any time, anywhere, there should be no reason why you   cannot complete assignments. If you have to miss a class, check SYLLABUS and   OUTLINE as well as printed lectures, and email class listserv for any other   problems. No one expects you to be perfect but you must write and read, and   then ask questions if you don't understand.

They survived it; so can we. In this course we will define terrorism the way   the Arabs define it, as any organized violence, by an individual, group or   state, legitimate or illegitimate, against a civilian population, either intentional   or unintentional. Because this is about twentieth and twenty first century   literature, we will include the two World Wars with All Quiet on the Western   Front, Night , No Exit, The Plague about Algerian terror as well   as the German occupation and natural scourges, to Islamic militant terrorism   in Egypt in The Day The Leader Was Killed, Satanic Verses, God Dies by   the Nile and War in the Land of Egypt, t o Israeli/Palestinian terror   in Martyr's Crossing and Wild Thorns, to the terror of hostage-taking   and kidnapping in Mao II, News of a Kidnapping, and The Hostage, to the terror   of totalitarian regimes such as China in Red Azalea and Soul Mountain.    Black Water is both a personal and stylistic meditation on terror as   well as an indirect indictment of the terror a powerful political leader has   over an innocent civilian. Because one objective of fiction/drama is to create   a combustive drama for the reader's catharsis, literature and terrorism are   really competing with each other. Sometimes real life provides so much terror   that the reader hides in literature for escape, seeking fantasy, happy endings,   funny, harmless stories that eschew the turmoil of an unlivable situation.   Often cultures will move through a transformation like New York did after   9/11, moving from the transformation of reality into tragedy with heroic stories,   to silly, innocuous escapes, to some social comedy, and finally to stories   that deal with fictional terror. No one can take too much of one thing. When   New Yorkers were coughing from the smoke and toxins downtown, they did not   go to the movies to see sci fi representations of Manhattan blowing up. Enough   is enough.   But literature is different from film because we can choose   when and how often to put the book down. Instead of watching a naturalistic   representation, we recreate the story in our minds to excite, soothe or incite   us. Many of the writers we will study had personal experience of a world war,   the holocaust, the Israeli checkpoints, prison for their writings or gender   brutality such as clitorectomies. Some could not write for years afterwards;   others wrote on toilet paper in prison. It is significant that terrorism demands   a certain amount of intelligence in order to achieve its devastating effect.   Formalist agenda about character, plot, style/language, theme, setting/geography,   descriptive techniques and narrative point of view must be supplemented and   developed to deal with how \"literature engages with contemporary critical   understandings of nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, global multiculturalism...\"   I would add cyberspace to the list. I also believe that it is stultifying   to repress critical reflection on difference to be politically correct. Not   only does it make us oblivious to the richness of difference, but we also   lose our sense of humor.   One of the most influential persons of the twentieth century   was Albert Einstein, not only for his theories on relativity, but because   he revolutionized the way humans perceive time and space in all domains from   art and literature to atomic warfare. The twentieth century novelbroke with   traditional structures as it questioned the linearity of time, the certainty   of empirical relality, and the \"reality\" of the external word by focusing   on stream of consciousness techniques, interior monologues and a nonlinear   use of time/space.James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust were the   innovators of this new novel, but we see their influence in the works of Joyce   Carol Oates BLACK WATER , Gao Xingpian's SOUL MOUNTAIN , Don DeLillo's    MAO II and Salman Rushdie's SATANIC VERSES .   No Exit is a good way to explore basic dramaturgy: unities   of time, space and action, character conflict (different objectives) and orchestration,   crisis/climax/resolution, and relationship of theme, HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE,   to central dramatic question, WHAT KIND OF HELL WILL EACH PERSON EXPERIENCE?   In terms of content, it deals with the German occupation of France during   world war II, and the Empire drawing room satirizes the stultifying life of   the French bourgeoisie in contrast to the new Marxism Sartre probably misunderstood.   It is the most accessible introduction to the philosophy of existentialism,   existence precedes essence, in contrast to the Cartesian saying, \"I think,   therefore I am.\" Sartre was a prolific writer of fiction, drama, literary   theory and philosophy.He popularized existentialism with sayings such as   \"I am therefore I think,\" &quot;Man is nothing more than the sum of his actions,&quot;   and \"Hell is other people.\" We will act out scenes from his brilliant, provocative,   well-structured play,   NO EXIT, to be found on my website.During the anthrax scare in the Fall   of 2002, students identified with the characters and situations in Camus'    The Plague .Both works are essential to an understanding of their   times, and yet they transcend their times so that they speak to us now in   the darkest moments of our war on terror. The Plague introduces us   to the formal elements that make a good novel, the third person narrative   that clinically but compassionately describes the struggles of Dr. Rieux to   help Oran survive the plague. Unlike drama, description and narration assume   paramount importance as the world transforms from before plague, to plague,   to post-plague. If we recall the anthrax attacks after 9/11, we remember how   easily Manhattan could be transformed into Oran. This is also as wonderful   study in character transformation as each person's true character is revealed   when he is confronted with the existential dilemma of possible or imminent   death.   While No Exit is a battle of individuals, The Plague   charts the growth, collapse and renewal of a community through a skillful,   meticulous attention to description and narration, the chief elements of novel   writing. Each culture has different expectations regarding characters, plausibility,   and levels of introspection, censorship, conformity to cultural values, as   well as the kinesthetic thrust of the drama. Western dramatic structure is   more linear, moving to that one big climax, while Arabic literature is recursive,   with many climaxes. American literature often wants \"three-dimensional\" characterization   and transformation while Arabic literature can sometimes go for good versus   evil. Spanish rhetoric/narrative styles are more circumlocutious, less direct.   Indian writers are often more diverse, layered, even chaotic than Arabic ones.   Rushdie versus Saadawi. Is this because of the pluralism of their religion   versus Islam's relentless monotheistic focus? Contemporary American audiences   expect a higher degree of plausibility, unless dealing with science fiction.   Yet there is much cross cultural influence. Oates' Black Water is as   recursive and thematic as an Arabic poem. DeLillo's Mao II has the   plurality, variety in tone, playful satire and chaos of a Rushdie work.   Martyr's Crossing is written in the same studied, skillful style as many   New Yorker fiction pieces. And most significantly, Soul Mountain combines   the reflective, vast space of pre-modern China with the effects of the repressive   Communist regime and then a deconstructed narrator, an I, she, he, you, who   plows through these mountains with the introspection of a French postmodern   writer. Perhaps that is one reason it won the Nobel Prize. What makes cultures   different? History, geography, ethnicity, language. But adaptation and change   occurs in response to the land, to the struggle for survival. Arabs are desert   peoples. In the desert the people see forever; their God is the sun, their   enemy excessive dryness. The vast mountains of China created a collective   culture in contrast to the vast mountains of America where ambitious individuals   forged a frontier through the wilderness, killing the indigenous people. So   as our cultures mix and mingle, delicious new concoctions of literature will   be created. The point of this course is to preserve the distinctness, the   diversity and the difference of cultural flavors, rather than looking at the   more homogeneous products of American mass culture with which we are already   familiar. By studying the narratives of diverse people we come to an empathy   and understanding for \"the other,\" so that we are not trapped in that good   versus evil, us versus them, binary crusade of many American politicians.   Major Twentieth Century Writers is a course in cross-cultural   communication as well as literary analysis. Ask yourselves why members of   some cultures seek solitude, whereas those of others feel sad or even incomplete   if they are not continuously in the company of other people? Why do some cultures   worship the Earth, whereas other molest it? Why do some cultures seek material   possession while other believe they are a hindrance to a peaceful life? Are   some cultures more visual, kinesthetic, linguistic, rhythmic than others?   As we analyze different styles of communication and expression, we weave a   fine line between political correctness and legitimate diversity, homogeneity   from the global melting plot, and specific differences that foster both creativity   and a combustive clash of civilisations.   ALTER EGOS: It   is important you have a subjective as well as a scholarly experience of this   great, global literature and therefore, each student will choose an alter   ego, a major character from one of the books who will journey with you through   the literature, enjoying the different countries and cultures, and perhaps   changing the plot by falling in love with one of the characters or creating   havoc, mayhem or good. Pick a character from a book you love but try to choose   someone whose culture, religion and/or gender are different from your own.   Find out as much as you can about the character and then let your imagination   and experiences through the other novels transform the character to your liking.   If you are confused, see what past students have done with their characters   in the webfolios at twenty/twenty.html,   ORAL PRESENTATIONS/RESEARCH PAPERS: Choose two of the   authors to compare and contrast, perhaps related to your alter ego. Read the   books carefully but also do internet and library research on a dilemma, looking   at the works embedded in their sociocultural context, using both primary and   secondary sources and focusing on literary theory, intellectual history, political   or military or religious issues, depending on your major and interests. Make   sure you have a clearly stated thesis that you develop through argumentation   and close textual analysis. For example, if your major is religion/philosophy,   you might want to analyze the Rushdie affair. Students will have a meatspace   class for their oral presentations, and are encouraged to use audiovisual   aids as well. Last year Jane Schreck did a middle eastern dance and brought   in her costumes, films and photos as she led us into a deeper understanding   of the world depicted in Nawal el Saadawi's writings.   CLOSE TEXTUAL ANALYSES: Every   other week we will upload close textual analyses from the assigned books.   Choose a few paragraphs from each book, copy them down triple spaced and anlyse   every work for implicit and explicit meaning, structure, relationship to the   whole etc. We may have related assignments such as writing a short memoir   or poem to help you further understand the microcosmic aspects of the literature.     .      OUTLINE    This course is organized into six distinct sections, each with a macro    (sociological, historical, philosophical, psychological aspects) and micro    component (the text itself.)    Cluster 1: One of the most important figures of the twentieth century    was Albert Einstein. Not only did he revolutionize science with his theory    of relativity, but literature, art, philosophy were all transformed by our    nonlinear views of time and space. The novel of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf    and Marcel Proust played with time, memory, and space in creative ways undreamt    of in previous centuries and cultures. With film, art and contemporary literature    we have poked holes in the unities of time and space, opening up narrative    to infinite possibilties. Throughout the semester let your imagination play    with time and space in your own lives. I have chosen Alan Lightman's EINSTEIN'S    DREAMS as your nightly bible.    Read a chapter every night before bed and meditate on that timespace change.    For more ideas on Einstein, go to twenty/zeller.html    or twenty/einstein1.html.    As you analyze the books, pay special attention to the use of time and space.    Alan Lightman was born in 1948 in Memphis, Tennessee. Lightman says that    ever since he was a child he built rockets and wrote poetry. He majored    in physics at Princeton, reasoning it was easier to be a scientist turned    writer than the other way around. In 1974 he received his doctorate in theoretical    astrophysics from Caltech in 1974. Between 1976 and 1899 Lightman taught    astronomy and physics at Harvard, moving to MIT in 1989 because there he    was given the chance to teach both of his loves--as a physicist and as the    director of the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies. Lightman credits    Rushdie and Marquez, two other writers on our list, for influencing his    work because they are writers who distort reality to see it more clearly.    He also enjoys reading writers from other cultures, so he can enter worlds    unlike his own. He tries to bring readers into the scientific world in EINSTEIN'S    DREAMS which he wrote in 1991 at his summer home on a small island off the    coast of Maine.    Our first cluster will examine THE PLAGUE by Albert Camus and NO EXIT by    Jean-Paul Sartre. On the macro level, we want to get an introduction to    Existentialism and the new Marxism and to how these great writers used literature    to further their ideologies; on the micro level we want to examine the works,    through close textual analysis, to see how the form of a play differs intrinsically    from that of a novel. Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was born into a well-to-do,    highly educated family and graduated first in his class in philosophy from    the Ecole Normale Superieure, one of the most schools in Europe. He met    Simone de Beauvoir, the second wave French feminist, and thus began a life-long    partnership. Sartre was greatly influenced by German philosphers such as    Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Edmund Husserl, thinkers    who questioned the existence of God, universal truth, immortal life and    many accepted &quot;truths&quot; of Western civilisation, in favor of a    more phenomenological approach to existence. During the Enlightenment, the    French philosopher Rene Descartes said, &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;    Sartre is quoted as saying, &quot;I am, therefore I think;&quot; in other    words, existence precedes essence, hence the name Existentialism. What this    means is that human consciousness develops as a response to phenomena in    the &quot;real&quot; world, as opposed to more Platonian ideals of consciousness    coming from man's soul or a higher being.    Sartre spent 1933-34 in Germany and when he returned he wrote his book    NAUSEA. Like many twentieth century intellectuals, he also had his stint    in prison, in a German prisoner-of-war camp in 1940. When he was released    in 1941, he became part of the French resistance against the German occupation,    and sought to combine his Existentialist theories of human individuality    and freedom with the collective responsibility of the new Marxism. Death,    without the hope of eternal life, creates anxiety but forces man to act    in the present, to make hard choices, to exercise his freedom, so that he    carves out a life, that is in essence, the sum of his actions. But this    existential philosophy should not make a man more selfish, but more responisible;    his choices must include a responsibility for humanity as well as himself.    In this respect Existentialism is a Humanism , the title of another of Sartre's    works. I use the pronoun &quot;he,&quot; because Sartre did, although his    partner was a strong feminist.    I received a Master's degree in French Literature from the Sorbonne in    Paris at a time when Sartre, Camus and the influence of existentialism on    the theatre of the absurd was most in vogue, before the post-structuralists    and postmodernists like Foucault, Derrida, Kristeva and Barthes had taken    over Parisian intellectual life. In fact my specialty was theatre of the    absurd and the title of my thesis was &quot;La Chute de la Tradition Theatrale,&quot;    which involved an analysis of the aesthetic as well as philosophical distinctions    between classical dramaturgy and theatre of the absurd such as Eugene Ionesco,    Samuel Beckett and others, and how the media of television and film had    forced an anti-naturalist trend on the theatre. I also performed in French    theatre as I was completing my degree there. NO EXIT has a classical structure    with existentialist themes, so it is different from works by Ionesco and    Becket.    Albert Camus (1913-1960) was born in Algeria to a poor, working class family    but because of his talent and brilliance, received distinction in philosophy    at the University and moved to Paris. He published THE STRANGER in 1942,    about an existential, alienated protagonist Meursault who murders a man,    for no apparent reason, and who is subsequently condemned to death. It is    as much an indictment of capital punishment and society's social norms as    it is an existentialist narrative, written in sparse, pristine prose. In    1947 he published THE PLAGUE, charting the inception, process and resolution    of this disease in a fictional North African town. It is a metaphor of the    German occupation during World War II but could apply to any event. During    the anthrax lockdowns after 9/11 last semester, students identified strongly    with this novel, with the different responses to the epidemic, and with    the personification of the disease and its devastation. After 9/11, we New    Yorkers know how it feels to be in a lockdown. Like Sartre, Camus was aware    of the social/cultural/psychological constraints of existentialism, but    he was more religious or spiritual. My professors at the Sorbonne thought    that he would have become more and more Catholic had he not been killed    in a car accident at 46. In fact, Sartre and Camus did split and dissociate    from each other after the war.    Both were prolific writers, spreading their energies across novels, short    stories, essays, plays and expository books, which is one reason why Existentialism    became a popular movement. However, I feel that Sartre was more gifted as    a dramatic and argumentative writer, and Camus as a novelist and lyrical    essayist.    Read NO EXIT    (it's all online, don't buy it ) and THE PLAGUE together for comparison    and contrast. Note that they both adhere to unities of time, space and action,    although THE PLAGUE takes a little longer to unwind. NO EXIT conforms to    Aristotelian dramaturgy on most levels. It is simply the conversations of    three newly deceased characters, coward Garcin, lesbian Inez, and baby-killer    Estelle in hell, which is a Louis XIV drawing room. They are waiting to    see when hell will begin until they finally realize that &quot;Hell is other    people.&quot; There are no mirrors: they must look into each other's eyes    for all self-affirmation and approval. And here is the rub because each    character wants and needs something from the others that they cannot give    him or her. NO EXIT is an excellent example of how interpersonal conflict    is combusted into intense, riveting dramatic action. Every stage is carefully    orchestrated until the door opens-- and no one can escape. There are unable    to exercise their human freedom to choose. But the hell is in essence, of    their own choosing, because they lack the strength of the existentialist    hero who can become the sum of his actions.    Working only with dialogue, the bourgeois drawing room and a few limited    props, Sartre is able to create a play that continues to be performed all    over the world as a great work of theatre, as well as a mouthpiece for the    chief tenets of Existentialism. The play was originally commissioned as    something short and easy to take on tour, with no changes in scenery and    only three actors. Sartre was also asked to ensure that none of the three    actors felt jealous of the other two by being forced to leave the stage    or getting the best lines; consequently, he began to think in terms of a    situation where three characters would be locked up together--first, in    a cell during an air raid, and then in hell. In this inferno, &quot;hell    is other people,&quot; because Estelle sees no truth, Joseph hears no truth,    and Inez speaks no good, according to former student Jerry Harman. In contrast,    THE PLAGUE uses methodical description and precise narration to suck us    into another hell, that of a population avoiding and finally facing the    ravages of the plague. This is a brilliant sociological study, of how characters    work with and against each other to fight a common evil. Dr. Rieux is like    Giuiliani after 9/11, making himself stronger by administering to the needs    of the population, working night and day with that indefatigable Hizzoner    energy.    Note how important descritive writing is to the art of the novel. Sartre    often lacks the patience to describe as thoroughly as Camus, preferring    to whip and hack and demolish his world with dramatic and philosophical    conflict. Camus documents, describes and patiently recreates a world palatable    to all our senses, a world that is often a metaphor for some philosophical    injusitice or condition he would rather not attack directly through expository    writing. Yet he focuses on the community more than the unconscious exploration    of the characters.    Since you need to pick a character to play for the semester, you might    enjoy playing any one of the characters in these two great works. For the    close textual analysis assignment, pick passages from the two books to analyze    to show the difference between dialogue and description aesthetically, the    main difference between a play and a novel.       I chose the books in Cluster Two,  ALL    QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and NIGHT, to give us a better understanding    of the World Wars on the macro level, and the effect of memoir or naturalistic    memory on the historical/political novel on the micro level. The tradition    of naturalism in literature was fortified in the second half of the nineteenth    century with the works of Emile Zola and the Victorians. For the first time,    readers wanted to see reality with all its warts, and not use literature    for escape, romance or entertainment. These books are in this tradition    although they have more twentieth century aesthetic and psychological dimensions.    ALL QUIET documents the trench warfare of World War I where soldiers were    in another kind of hell for months at a time, fighting against young men    for reasons they did not really understand.    NIGHT documents the holocaust and what it took to survive the concentration    camps. Both books were drawn from personal experience. Both Remarque and    Wiesel suffered, in part, from post traumatic stress syndrome from their    experiences during these terrible wars. For a time they ran away from their    suffering, and were not able to catharsize their pain fully until these    books were published.    Elie Wiesel is the author of 36 works dealing with Judaism, the Holocaust    and the moral responsibility of all people to fight hatred, racism and genocide.    Born 1928 in Romania, Wiesel led a religious, communal life until 1944 when    he and his family were deported by the Nazis and sent to concentration camps.    The following words were written with his blood, embedded forever in his    memory: \"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which    has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times    sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little    faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath    a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith    forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me,    for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments    which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall    I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself.    Never.\" Is this how you feel about 9/11? What are your memories of the event?    What is your \"night?\" But it was Wiesel's steely will to survive that enabled    him to leave Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Gleiwitz after the liberation in    1945 and eventually study at the Sorbonne, which nurtured the French writers,    Gao Xingjian and your illustrious Professor Evergreen. Wiesel became chairman    of the President's Commission on the Holocaust and was awarded the Congressional    Gold Medal of Achievement.    In May 7,2002, Wiesel wrote a letter to George W. Bush just before Ariel    Sharon's arrival in Washington with the following pleas:    &quot;Please remember that a majority of Israelis favor a Palestinian State    alongside Israel if the terror is stopped, whereas a majority of Palestinians,    including Yasir Arafat support suicide killing operations against Israel.    Please remember that while Palestinian Terrorists were hiding explosives    in ambulances, Israeli reservists in Jenin were taking up collections out    of their own funds to repay Palestinian families for the damage done to    their homes. Please remember that the maps on Arafat's uniform and in Palestinian    children's textbooks show a Palstine encompanssing not only all of the West    Bank but all of Israel, while Palestinian leaders loudly proclaim that 'Palestine    extends from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, from Rosh Hanikra    (in the North) to Rafah (in Gaza). Please remember Danielle Shefi, a little    girl in Israel. Danielle was give. When the murderers came, she hid under    her bed. Palestinian gunmen found and killed her anyway. Think of all the    other victims of terror in the Holy Land. With rare exceptions, the targets    were young people, children and families. Please remember that Israel--having    lost too many sons and daughters, mothers and fathers--desperately wants    peace. It has learned to trust its enemies' threats more than the empty    promises of 'neutral' governments. Today, more than ever, Israel must be    trusted to decide what concessions are or are not possible within the framework    of its own security. Please remember that Ariel Sharon, a military man who    knows the ugly face of war better than anyone, is ready to make 'painful    sacrifices' to end the conflict. In fact it was he who carried out the handing    over of Yamit, displacing thousands of Israelis, in exchange for peace with    Egypt. Please remember that while Israelis mourned alongside us for our    nation's tragedy on September 11th, Yasir Arafat was busy suppressing footage    of his constituents dancing in the streets. Please remember that American    Jews share your moral outrage at international terrorism as well as your    determination to defend democratic ideals and religious freedom in the world.    As diversified as we are in our political views, we are united in our hope    that you, the leader in the campaign against the world-wide terror, will    recognize that terror is Israel is but another of its facets, another result    of the hatred being systematically taught to Arab children by the Palestinian    Authority and state-funded schools elsewhere in the Muslim world. Years    ago, we had hopes that we were entering a new era, an era of peace that    would see Palestinians living alongside Israelis, in an alliance that would    make the entire area flourish. If the Palestinian leadership can be persuaded    to stop the abomination of terrorist attacks on innocent civilians, it may    still not be too late.&quot;       Think about that letter when we get to cluster four and analyse WILD THORNS    and MARTYR'S CROSSING.    For the close textual analysis assignment, copy out two passages from each    of the books that seem the most moving to you. Then write down your memoir    from 9/11. Then look at the relationship of the memoir to the event, to    what the personal story gives you that you cannot get in a history book    or traditional novel. How does the memoir get closer to reality and give    the novel depth and breadth? How does the novel based on memoir allow the    personal story to be catharsized completely? How does your memoir give dimension    to mainstream news coverage of 9/11?       Cluster Three: Inspired by my trip to    the middle east and love of Egyptian culture, (another Western orientalist?    not exactly!) I chose the next three books to analyze cross-cultural story    expectations, Islamic feminism and the recursive, poetic aesthetics of Arabic    story-telling, as well as the different time/space elements. In GOD DIES    BY THE NILE the sexual abuse of young girls, the clitorectomies, the    stoning of the adulteress, many of the injustices present in contemporary    Islam are ruthlessly described by Nawal el Saadawi, the first female Egyptian    doctor whose writing was so controversial she was imprisoned by Sadat. THE    DAY THE LEADER WAS KILLED is a collection of monologues by three characters    about their domestic/love problems around the time Sadat was assassinated,    but again, the focus is on the injustice of the arranged marriage that Randa    must submit to for social approval and financial necessity, in spite of    her love for Elwan, and the grandfather's wisdom, pain and ultimate impotence.    Sadat's murder is wedged in between Elwan's beating of his rival to death,    which seems almost like a unconscious eruption of rage and jealousy. For    more ideas about cross-cultural feminism, go to twenty/bodyf.html.    Neither book has the linear kinesthetic thrust of the traditional western    crisis/climax/resolution. In GOD DIES there are so many crises/climaxes    that Zakeya's murder of the village leader seems only one of many. When    asked where Allah is, she says, in prison, that she killed him-- he is buried    on the banks of the Nile. El Saadawi's structure is Arabic in its recursive    themes of sun rising and setting on every scene, but also multi-orgasmic    with its many climaxes. Mahfo uz weaves his climax into the fabric    of Egyptian domestic life, never giving in to its finality, always letting    each character finish the integrity of his monologue, asserting his    own microcosmic reality. WAR IN THE LAND OF EGYPT is also written    with very different story expectations than typical Hollywood fare. None    of these books have really happy endings, unless one could say that ending    up in prison is a happy ending.    Naguib Nahfouz is the best-known and most studied Arab novelist in the    Anglophone world. Mafouz was born in a warren of ancient alleys in the heart    of Islamic Cairo, behind the al-Hussein Mosque, in the neighborhood of Gamaliya,    in December 1911. His father, a minor civil cervant, was highly traditional,    and his mother was doting, his childhood lonely but unremarkable. After    attending Islamic elementary schools and a secular high school, he entered    Cairo University (then King Faud 1) University and in 1934 graduated with    a degree in philosophy. He rememberes that period, which coincided with    the anticolonial movement against the British, as the happiest of his life--as    &quot;the golden age of patriotism....when the times themselves were listening    to you,&quot; he wrote in his 1961 novel The Thief and the Dogs .    Until 1971, all his works were written late at night, for he spent his    days as a government bureaucrat: as an official film censor, an adviser    on the arts, and a minor functionary in various ministries, including the    Ministry of Religious Affairs. A private, timid man who married late in    life, Mahfouz is a strong believer, a bit of a mystic, and a Fabian socialist    of the most passionate sort. Mahfouz married a Christian woman at age 43    and had two daughters and no grandchildren. He has never liked to travel,    leaving Egypt some three times in his life. By the late 1950s, social realism    had become the defining characteristic of his work. His well-ordered, punctilious,    conservative daily life was the antithesis of the world he created in his    books. Note what he says in this book we are studying: &quot;We live in    a repugnant age of slogans. And between the slogans and the truth is an    abyss, into which we have all fallen and lost ourselves.&quot;    He published his first novel in 1939 and since then has written thirty-two    novels and thirteen collections of short stories. This prolific writer's    work appears to have gone through four stages. The first (1939-44) consisted    of three novels based on the history of ancient Egypt, focusing on a cherished    theme, the heroic struggle of the Egyptians and their patriotic Pharaohs    to expel the Hysos, as foreign ruling invaders, from their country. Like    Camus' THE PLAGUE, THE STRUGGLE OF THEBES bore a relevance to Egyptian sociopolitcal    reality, the British occupation. In 1945, Mahfouz left the history of Phaoronic    Egypt to write A NEW CAIRO. This led to the publication of THE CAIRO    TRILOGY, in 1956-57, a realistic study of Egyptian urban society between    the two World Wars. In THE MIRAGE, published in 1948, Mahfouz experimented    with a psychoanalytic novel, inspired by Freud. In 1959 another stage began    with OUR QUARTER, an allegory of human history. In the mid seventies    he returned to the fourth stage where he asserts the unique voice of Arabic    narrative forms in THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS and THE DAY THE    LEADER WAS KILLED .    Mahfouz' world view is similar to Sartre's social commitment and responsibility,    a far cry from the nihilism of Islamic extremists. His work reveals the    irony of a European intellectual woven through the ancient Arabic storytelling.    In 1988 the Swedish Academy gave him the Nobel Prize and wrote that \"through    works rich in nuance-- now clearsightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous,    Mahfouz has formed an Arabic narrative art that applies to all mankind.\"    His characters are warm and human, in spite of and because of their grotesque    flaws from the tyrannical merchant of the Cairo Trilogy, to his debauched    and fanatical sons, to the weak and wayward women who tempt and distract    them. Yet there is a robust sensuality, a deep reverence for Islam, a generous    tolerance and the creation of world so ripe and vivid that you want to savor    it forever. CHILDREN OF THE ALLEY with its autocratic rulers and echoes    of prophets found in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, proved most controversial    and prompted a religious fatwa calling for his death in 1989.    In 1994 there was a near-fatal assault on Mahfouz by Islamic terrorists,    wonderfully described by Mary Anne Weaver in her book, A Portrait of    Egypt (1999) when he was stabbed while sitting in his car. since then    he has only been able to write for 30 minutes at a time because of injuried    nerves. He must keep armed guards around his apartment even now, in 2002.90    year old Mahfouz was recently interviewed (2002) for the New York Times .    He says that even now he struggles to write every day: &quot;A writer must    sit down to write every day, pick up his pen and try to write something--    anything-- on a piece of paper. Perhaps they will succeed, or maybe come    up with a new idea that will blossom eventually. Perhaps they will complete    a short story, and perhaps nothing will happen at all.&quot;       Like many of the writers we are studying, Mahfouz is intensely involved    in political, social and philosophical debate. At 90 his eyes and ears are    so impaired that a friend arrives every morning to read the headlines for    an hour. He gave his first interest payments from his Nobel Prize to Palestinian    charities and now defends suicide bombers, a common position among Arab    intellectuals:    &quot;They are people defending a cause by sacrificing with their souls,    and this is the highest level of noble resistance, although the death of    civilians is regrettable. We have to remember that this is not a regular    fight, a regular war where you can choose your target and fight only soldiers.    This is a desperate situation where you blow yourself up and whoever happens    to be on the site.&quot;    At the same time he shows little patience for those who want to destroy    Israel or censor freedom of expression or intercultural exchanges between    Jews and Arabs. At the end of the interview, after discussing death, he    said:    &quot;That is the way of life. You give up your pleasures one by one until    there is nothing left, and then you know it is time to go.&quot;    Think of the elements of THE DAY THE LEADER WAS KILLED, describing the    time when Mohammad Atta lived in Egypt: the decline of the Egyptian system,    the emergence of an authoritarian state, a middle-class urban family torn    apart by economic stagnation and uncertainty, the sexual tensions of a young    couple in a society in which men and women are kept strictly apart, the    rise of corruption, and of militant Islam, as the almost inevitable result    of a system that seems to be spiraling out of control.    Elwan could be like many of the cafe drifters, unable to find a job or    buy or furnish an apartment, unable therefore, to marry Randa the woman    he loves, and forced to share that dingy, cramped room with his grandfather.    Think of what he says in that coffeehouse, a coffeehouse where Mafouz probably    did most of his writing: &quot;We are a people more acclimatized to defeat    than to victory. It is just a Mafia which controls us--no more, no less.    Where are the good old days?...My pride wounded, my heart broken, I have    come to this cafe as a refuge from the pain of loneliness....How many nations    live side by side in this one nation of ours? How many millionaires are    there? Relatives and parasites? Smugglers and pimps? Shi'ites and Sunnis?--stories    far better than A Thousand and One Nights What do eggs cost today?    This is my concern. Yet, as the same time, singers and belly dancers in    the nightclubs on Pyramid Road are showered with banknotes and gratuities.    What did the imam of the mosque say within earshot of the soldiers of the    Central Security Force? There is not one public lavatory in this entire    neighborhood...[Sada] He's a failure--&quot;my friend [Menachem]Begin, my    friend Kissinger,&quot; is all he can say; his uniform is Hitler's; his    act, the act of Charlie Chaplin. He's rented our entire country--furnished--to    the United States...&quot;    There are many Saudi extremists who feel that Saudi Arabia has been rented,    furnished, to the US as well. While Mafouz chronicles Eyptian urban life    in Cairo, el Saadawi and al Qa'id describe the corruption of the authorities,    usually the Imam, in the rural outskirts.        Nawal el Saadawi in &quot;BREEDING TERROR or AN UNCIVILISED CLASH OF CIVILIZATONS&quot;:    \"Once again we are facing the fundamentalist, absolutist dichotomy of God    versus the Devil, and of Good versus Evil used to mystify people, to confuse    them, to veil their minds. The language which George W. Bush uses is no    different from that of the pope, or that of bin Laden. All three speak in    the name of God against the enemy, against the Devil. The church and the    mosque are not just spiritual bodies with a spiritual agenda, but also geopolitical,    economic and even military bodies, but their agendas here are clothed in    spiritual robes....This war on terrorism is being used to halt the rising    wave of opposition to unbridled transnational exploitation of nature, human    resources and human life. In the global patriarchal capitalist system war    ahas been and remians the economic stimulus required to stave off recession    and protect accumulation of profits. But I wonder how many bombs will be    needed, and how many innocent people must die in order to ensure that the    Dow Jones and the Nasdaq will begin to climb once more....State terrorism    is the elder brother of individual terrorism except that it claims the legitimacy    of laws upheld by a powerful few.\"    Like American and Israeli leaders, she feels that fear is the great enemy,    not because we can't shop till we drop, but because it will make us accept    anything in the name of security or the war against terrorism. \"Fear can    help the Big Brother to drive us with a big stick into an Orwellian world.\"    El Saadawi believes we should eradicate the original roots of all kinds    of terrorism by restoring religion to the personal realm and developing    secular huimanist societies that are able to abolish colonial and neo-colonial    principles as well as the hegemony of the multinational corporations of    the World Economic Forum. She speaks at the World Social Forum, advocating    peace, love and justice from the grassroots up, abolishing all patriarchal    systems that breed double standards and binary thinking. What do YOU think?       El Saadawi was born into a well educated family in 1931 in the village    of Kafr Tahal, Egypt. Along with Shakespeare, Aristotle, Sartre, DeLillo,    Lightman, she is one of my heros because of the energy, curiosity, intelligence    and strength which with she has embraced and attacked so many areas of human    knowledge and discourse: medicine, literature, politics, religion. She even    has a great website. www.nawalsaadawi.net. After her imposed clitorectomy,    she has been a strong advocate for feminist rights, criticizing the sexism    of the American cosmetics industry as well as Islamic fundamentalism. In    1955 she became Egypt's Director of Public Health, but her book WOMEN    AND SEX (1972), condemning clitorectomies and the veiling of the female    mind even more than her body, aroused the anger of male authorities who    put her in prison because of her continued research and writings in this    area. After his assassination in l981 (read Mahfouz) she was freed and continued    her political, medical and literary fight for the rights of oppressed peoples,    particularly women. She claims that Westerners are particularly oppressed    by their governments because they believe they are free even though they    are the greatest true believers of them all and their democracy an illusion    of freedom and equal rights.    In spite of her didacticism, her writing can be beautifully simple and    poetic with ancient themes like the rising and setting of the sun in GOD    DIES BY THE NILE . While DeLillo begins writing by deconstructing the    sentence, by falling in love with words, she distrusts words, because they    are weapons manipulated by Machiavellian politicians:\"Language should be    clear, so we understand each other. No monopoly, no playing, no games, no    political games, no linguistic games, because I am really fed up with the    linguistic games of the so-called 'postmodern era.'...We find ourselves    lost in an avalanche of words which appear very dissident, and which multiplya    dn reproduce themselves endlessly....We drown in these words; we are suffocated    by them. It is the zero-sum game of words in which you lose your power to    understand.\" For el Saadawi, language is a weapon, at least to those who    imprisoned her, a weapon she will not give up even if it means her body    would be imprisoned again. Like many great writers of our times, writing    is her jihad, and as founder and president of the Arab Women Solidarity    Association, her strong stance offers a welcome antidote to many solution    to the clash of civilisations.    Like many of the books in this syllabus, WAR IN THE LAND OF EGYPT was banned    in its country of origin in the seventies. Unlike much of the Arabic literature,    this story is steeped in irony and black humor as it recounts the fiasco    that occurs when a village elder persuades a poor night-watchman to send    his own son as a stand-in for the elder's son who was drafted into the Egyptian    army on the eve of the 1973 October war. Like Mahfouz, Yusuf al-Qa'id makes    use of multiple narrators, but Qa'id's characters do not each present the    entirety of the plot; in fact, there is eventually no overlap in their narrations,    and therefore little or not repetition of events. This permits the plot    to unfold as it would in a standard narrative, devoid of multiple voices,    which enhances the story's dramatic impact while maintaining the variety    of perspectives and giving us a microcosmi catalogue of Egyptian social    types. The characters are conscious of their roles, as well as their co-narrators,    which leads to more conflict between the characters. The story is embedded    in Qa'id's sociology where schisms between rich and poor, city and country,    mystery and myth deepen the conflicts between characters. After all my years    of reading and writing, al-Qa'id has given me a more pristine understanding    of narrative.    Born in 1944, Yusuf Qa'id is one of the most important representatives    of the new generation in style and sociological message, even though (or    maybe because) he was born in a small village from a long line of poor,    illiterate peasants, and received all his education in his native land.    His trilogy, THE COMPLAINTS OF THE ELOQUENT EGYPTIAN, involves an author    writing a novel, drafts of which are incorporated into the text, along with    other documents. Another of his novels, IT IS HAPPENING IN EGYPT NOW foreshadows    interactive hyperfiction as it invites the reader to create the novel along    with the author, providing documents for that purpose.    Choose short passages from each of the three books that illustrate the    unique features of Arabic story telling, the recursive themes and structure,    multiple and/or mysterious or flattened climaxes, multiple narrators. Sometimes    I like to compare Western ballet to Middle Eastern dance to help students    understand the difference between the gravity-defying, competitive discipline    of pointe work with the earthbound, undulating, repetitive sensuousness    of belly dancing. Or compare the round, voluptuous spaciousness of Mosque    architecture to the jagged, stuffed, ambitious and upward bound soaring    of a skyscraper. See if you can find the same similarities in the literature.    In spite of her didacticism, El Saadawi's writing can be beautifully simple    and poetic with ancient themes like the rising and setting of the sun in    GOD DIES BY THE NILE. While DeLillo begins writing by deconstructing the    sentence, by falling in love with words, she distrusts words, because they    are weapons manipulated by Machiavellian politicians:\"Language should be    clear, so we understand each other. No monopoly, no playing, no games, no    political games, no linguistic games, because I am really fed up with the    linguistic games of the so-called 'postmodern era.'...We find ourselves    lost in an avalanche of words which appear very dissident, and which multiplya    dn reproduce themselves endlessly....We drown in these words; we are suffocated    by them. It is the zero-sum game of words in which you lose your power to    understand.\" For el Saadawi, language is a weapon, at least to those who    imprisoned her, a weapon she will not give up even if it means her body    would be imprisoned again. Like many great writers of our times, writing    is her jihad, and as founder and president of the Arab Women Solidarity    Association, her strong stance offers a welcome antidote to many solution    to the clash of civilisations.    Note how the climaxes of WAR IN THE LAND OF EGYPT and THE DAY THE LEADER    WAS KILLED seem like seeds embedded in a labyrinth and the narrative objective    is to unravel the story within the community. GOD DIES BY THE NILE is multi-climactic,    with horrendous evenets occurring in almost every chapter, in a way that    leaves the reader exhausted or breathless. But the structure almost comes    from the placement of the sun in each of these events and the interface    of the Ordinary World of the village with the Special World of the wilderness    of Om Saber, Metwalli the necrophiliac, the runaway women and men and the    sites of death orgies. How different these structures are from the typical    Hollywood movie, which is essentially a cliffhanger!    When I was in Egypt, I got the worst sunburn of my life, so I am particularly    aware of the influence of the sun on the writings. In the desert, sunrise    and sunset are the big events, the only changes in that eternal landscape.    For your close textual analysis, pay particular attention to the relationship    of geography to spirituality, dreams, symbols, and the role of women in    this fiercely patriarchal world. Arabic languages are written from right    to left; metaphors, similes, long arrays of adjectives and repetition of    words are frequently used by Arabs in communicating all ideas, witness the    political rhetoric of Osama bin Laden. Again, there are some wonderful characters    to play in these books as well as great places to take your character. Don't    forget your alter ego can change the story, fall in love with the oppressed    women, take people out of jail, or change the plot any way you so desire.    Have fun!       Cluster Four: MARTYR'S CROSSING, WILD THORNS and SATANIC VERSES    were chosen to bring light to the middle eastern conflicts and    to help us understand role criticism, an outgrowth of theories of multiple    selves, developed by Foucault, Derrida, Kristeva, Sherry Turkel and other    thinkers in the second half of the twentieth century. Do a novelists' characters    reflect their thoughts? Which role are YOU playing now? Do we have one integrated    self, or are we made up of a kaleidoscope of selves? Are you starting to    integrate your alter ego in your own life? Is he helping you or wrecking    havoc?    Salman Rushdie still cannot fly Air Canada because the airline is afraid    some Islamic extremist will bring down the plane in an effort to fulfill    the fatwa issued by Iran after publication of SATANIC VERSES. Yet this is    a book of fiction. Islamic rebuttal to Western condemnation of Fatwa against    SATANIC VERSES : Semseddin Turk , the President of the MIT Islamic    Society writes \"Because of the unequivocal attempt at associating itself    with real events, THE SATANIC VERSES is dangerously, even criminally,    misleading for a Western audience that knows little about Islam and Muslims.    Rushdie's metaphors and symbols are strongly reminiscent of and reinforce    traditional Western prejudices and myths about Islam. THE SATANIC VERSES    is one of the most slanted works in a regular cycle of intentional or unintentional    misrepresentations of Islam and Muslims in media sources and textbooks.    Because of its wild implications and virulent language, the novel constitutes    an unprecedented assault on Islam, and indirectly, on the Abrahamic religions    preceding it.\"    The novel aptly begins with Saladin Chamcha and Gibreel Farishta falling    from an expoding airplane, hijacked by Shiite terrorists, to the shores    of Britain. Chamcha is an anglicized Indian who has lived in England since    youth, while Gibreel, a religious movie star, recently recovered from an    illness where he lost faith in Islam, comes to England to pursue Alleluia    Cone who he fell in love with in India. Upon arrival, Saladin grows horns    and hooves and thick hair develops all over his body, while Gibreel acquires    a halo, metamorphosing into forces of good and evil which Rushdie then blurs    by making Saladin embrace his Indian heritage while Gibreel begins to doubt    his pro-Western choices. At the end Saladin is bettered by his transformation    while Gibreel, who was the \"angel,\" commits suicide to escape from his dilemmas.    What Muslims most object to are the dreams of Gibreel, the story of Jahilia    and Mahound, the latter referring to the prophet Mohammed and the former    referring to the city of \"ignorance,\" or Mecca. He then refers to the great    personalities of Islam as \"fucking clowns,\" \"riff-raff,\" and \"goons.\" The    verses of the Koran are \"revelations of convenience.\" They particularly    hate his discussion of sex where \"sodomy and the missionary position were    apporved by the archangel, whereas the forbidden positions included all    those in which the female was on top.\" Mahound is guilty of \"fucking as    many women as he liked,\" including mothers and daughters.    Westerners rebut that Muslims are being too literal and unimaginative,    confusing postmodern, deconstructionist fictional techniques, irony, and    suspension of disbelief with deliberately malicious anti-Islamic propaganda,    thereby repressing freedom of speech. Muslims protest against the use of    obscene, violent language when dealing with respected Muslim religious leaders.    Nikos Kazantzakis also received similar criticism, without eternal death    threats, for THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.    In an open letter to Rajiv Ghandhi, Rushdie states: \"The section of the    book in question (and let's remember the book isn't actually about Islam,    but about migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death, London    and Bombay) deals with a prophet who is snot called Muhammed living in a    highly fantastical city...in which he is surrounded by fictional followers,    one of whom happens to bear my own first name. Moreover, this entire sequence    happens in a dream, the fictional dream of a fictional character, an Indian    movie star, and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from    history could one get?    Rushdie was born to liberal, prosperous Muslim parents in Bombay June    19, 1947. In August 14 of that year, Pakistan divided itself from India    as part of an agreement ending the period of British colonialism in South    Asia. The result was a chaotic and extremely violent period as 6 million    Muslims moved north to the newly-established Islamic state and 8 million    Hindus and Sikhs moved south fleeing it. In 1961 he moved to England to    study at Rugby School and then Kings College, Cambridge. In 1980 he published    MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN which won the Booker Prize but gained a law suit from    Indira Gandhi who won her libel case before she was assassinated. In 1983    he published SHAME and in 1988 SATANIC VERSES. Like India, SATANIC VERSES    is dense, multicultural, creative, rich, magical, chaotic, a complex \"chutneyfication\"    of echoes and allusions that Rushdie infuses with biting satire. Like Wittgenstein,    Rushdie seeks to attack questions ather than provide pat answers and paradigms,    to break down the rigid, self-righteous orthodoxy of extemist Islam.    The theme is a search for identity in a post-colonial, pre-colonial vein.    People of Anglo-saxon stock are almost entirely absent form the London of    THE SATANIC VERSES. Instead the city swarms with immigrants: Indians, Bengalis,    Pakistanis, Jamaicans, German Jews, etc. He reminds the English that they    too were colonized, by the Romans and the Normans. Interestingly, he rejects    both martyrdom and triumphant nationalism as inadequate foundations for    a satisfactory self-identity, questioning the credibility and beneficence    of orthodox, traditional Islam. Gibreel's dreams challenge the Koran's claims    to infallibility, accuse Islam of the repression of women, call into question    the probity and honesty of the Prophet himself. He spares no institution    or person in his quest to answer the question, what kind of idea are we?    Underneath its complex structure Rushdie reaffirms beliefs in individual    liberty and tolerance, freedom of expression, skepticism about dogma, and    belief in the redemptive power of love. Again Rushdie voices some of the    issues developed by Sartre in his affirmation of human freedom and responsibility    in a world devoid of absolutes. Rusdie writes about the novel in his essay,    \"Is Nothing Sacred?\" \"Because whereas religion seeks to privileg one language    above all others, the novel has always been about the way in which different    languages, values and narratives quarrel, and about the shifting relations    between them, which are relations of power. The novel does not seek to establish    a privileged language, but it insists upon the freedom to portray and analyze    the struggle between the different contestants for such privileges. (420)    ...while the novel anaswers our need for wonderment and understanding, it    brings us harsh and unpalatable news as well. It tells us there are no rules.    It hands down no commandments....And it tells us there are no answers; or    rather, it tells us that answers are easier to come by, and less reliable,    than questions. If religion is an answer, if political ideology is an answer,    then literature is an inquiry; great literature, by asking extraordinary    questions, opens new doors in our minds. (423) \"In the twentieth century,    the novel came to be viewed as primarily oppositional, critical of the culture    which produced it. Rather than providing values, it challenges them. Modern    novels are praised for their courage in exposing hypocrisy, challenging    tradition, exploring forbidden themes. If blasphemy is not the most common    of techniques in western fiction it is because so few writers take religion    seriously enough to feel it worth attacking. \"(Rushdie:\"In God We Trust\"376-377)       In 1988 VikingPenguin published SATANIC VERSES at which point a Saudi newspaper    in London denounced him. Threats and complaints followed and in 1989 the    book was burned before TV cameras in England, 5 members of an extremist    group attacked the American Culture Center in Islamabad, and in Kashmir,    sixty were injured and one died in a protest. For these questions and his    plIn an age of terror, how does literature help us transcend our reality, lend perspective to our confusion by pulling us into the past and other cultures, and give expression to our anguish and fear through catharsis? They survived it; so can we. In this course we will define terrorism the way the Arabs define it, as any organized violence, by an individual, group or state, legitimate or illegitimate, against a civilian population, either intentional or unintentional. Because this is about twentieth and twenty first century literature, we will include the two World Wars with All Quiet on the Western Front, Night, No Exit, The Plague about Algerian terror as well as the German occupation and natural scourges, to Islamic militant terrorism in Egypt in The Day The Leader Was Killed, Satanic Verses, God Dies by the Nile and War in the Land of Egypt, to Israeli/Palestinian terror in Martyr's Crossing and Wild Thorns, to the terror of hostage-taking and kidnapping in Mao II, News of a Kidnapping, and The Hostage, to the terror of totalitarian regimes such as China in Red Azalea and Soul Mountain. Black Water is both a personal and stylistic meditation on terror as well as an indirect indictment of the terror a powerful political leader has over an innocent civilian. Because one objective of fiction/drama is to create a combustive drama for the reader's catharsis, literature and terrorism are really competing with each other. Sometimes real life provides so much terror that the reader hides in literature for escape, seeking fantasy, happy endings, funny, harmless stories that eschew the turmoil of an unlivable situation. Often cultures will move through a transformation like New York did after 9/11, moving from the transformation of reality into tragedy with heroic stories, to silly, innocuous escapes, to some social comedy, and finally to stories that deal with fictional terror. No one can take too much of one thing. When New Yorkers were coughing from the smoke and toxins downtown, they did not go to the movies to see sci fi representations of Manhattan blowing up. Enough is enough. ayful satire, Rushdie was condemned to death by the Ayotollah Khomeini    of Iran in the following fatwa: \"I inform all zealous Muslims of the world    that the author of the book entitled SATANTIC VERSES--which has been compiled,    printed and published in opposition to Islam, the Prophet, and the Koran--and    all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are    sentenced to death.\"    He elaborates: \"I call on zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever    they may be found, so that no one else will dare to insult the Muslim sanctities.    God Willing, whoever is killed on this path is a martyr.\" Rushdie defended    himself as follows: \"Nowadays...a powerful tribe of clerics has taken over    Islam. These are the contemporary Thought Police. They have turned Muhammad    into a perfect being, his life into a perfect life, his revelation into    the unambiguous, clear event it originally was not. Powerful taboos have    been erected. One may not discuss Muhammad as if he were human, with human    virtues and weaknesses. One may not discuss the growth of Islam as a historical    phenomenon, as an ideology born out of its time. These are the taboos against    which THE SATANIC VERSES has transgressed (these and one other: I also tried    to write about the place of women in Islamic society, and in the Koran).    It is for the breach of taboo that the novel is being anathematized, ...THE    SATANIC VERSES is not, in my view, an antireligious novel. It is, however,    an attempt to write about migration, its stresses and transformations, from    the point of view of migrants from the Indian subcontinent to Britain. This    is, for me, the saddest irony of all; that after working for five years    to give voice and fictional flesh to the immigrant culture of which I am    myself a member, I should see my book burned, largely unread, by the people    it's about, people who might find some pleasure and much recognition in    its pages. I tried to write against stereotypes; the zealot protests serve    to confirm, in the Western mind, all the worst stereotypes of the Muslim    world.\" (The Book Burning 25) Even though his book was fiction, Rushdie    was personally blamed for its ideas. The extremists lack humor and suspension    of disbelief as well as tolerance. But the book itself as well as the political    controversy are good examples of the dilemmas of role criticism, which we    will examine in the American Jewish and Palestinian interpretations of occupations    and Israeli checkpoints.The story of the Satanic Verses is not mentioned    either in the Koran or in any of the early oral or written sources. As a    magical realist, Rushdie chooses to focus all his attention on these figments,    instead of writing a more accurate, comprehensive version of Islam. But    he is a novelist, not a scholar.    One of my students was recently reprimanded in the New York subway in July    2002 for reading SATANIC VERSES. Accosted by a Muslim woman, she was told    &quot;not to believe anything in that book.&quot; Is that the point of novels,    to make us believe, or is suspension of disbelief just the willingness to    enter a FANTASY world created by the author? Why do so many cultures, American    included, expect fiction to be naturalistic, true to life? Why do some of    us take irony, humor, satire, fantasy so literally?    Ever since I spent the night in a Greek freighter in the harbor of Alexandria,    listening to Egyptians throwing grenades into the sea in the hopes of bursting    the eardrums of Israeli frogmen who were planting bombs in their ships,    I have been unable to take sides in the middle eastern conflicts. I see    humans on both sides; rights and wrongs committed by all states. In MARTYR'S    CROSSING and WILD THORNS we will explore the humanity on all sides, the    longing, frustration, guilt, despair and rage that has caused the holy land    to be so unholy for so many years.    Sahar Khalifeh was born in 1941 during the British mandate in Palestine    in Nablus. She left a frustrating marriage to study literature and feminism    in America. Her first novel was confiscated by the Israelis, which shows    that militant Iran is not the only country guilty of censorship. Her second    novel was first published in Cairo. She has taught at Iowa and Bir Zeit    University and probably knew some of the suicide bombers, maybe even the    women. She founded the Women's Affairs Center in Nablus. In WILD THORNS    we see militancy as a necessary venue of resistance to Israeli occupation.    But Khalifeh does not let didacticism make her prose laborious and heavy;    the novel is rich and succulent like ripe olives and we see, hear and feel    the characters-- the underground, militant high schoolers we have recently    seen so often in the news, the shopkeeper who sells groceries to Israeli    soldiers, or the village mothers who ululate in solidarity as their homes    are bulldozed. Although it was written in 1975, the novel offers us a deeper    understanding of what is going on in 2002 with the seige of the Church of    Nativity, the bulldozing of homes in Jenin, and the terrors of the suicide/homicide    bombers/martyrs.    Khalifeh's characters are not drawn with the same good vs evil morality    we saw in GOD DIES BY THE NILE. After Usama assasinates the Israeli officer,    &quot;sombre images fill Adil's mind. The dead officer, his grieving widow,    the little girl stretched out on the ground, her pale, bare legs partly    covered by Um Sabir's veil. People running through the streets, someone    yelling, 'Leave a pig alone!' Bitterness flooded his heat. My cousin kills    a man and I carry off his daughter. Tragedy or farce? Still, the memory    of the Israeli woman's head on his shoulder, despite all the boundaries    that divided people, seemed top opne the horizons of this narrow world.&quot;    (172)    Those who compromise, however, are usually the ones to survive, so Adil    must suffer to see his family home blown up by the Israelis: &quot;Take    a deep breath, Adil told himself. Tears. Dust. Fog. He could smell lemonwood    through the acrid aroma of dust and crumbling stone. The lemon tree was    burning in the rubble of the courtyard. The soldiers looked so arrogant    in their dark cars. A thirst for reenge, for rebellion, stirred deep within    him. I'm not cruel, but I'm filled with rage and bitterness, filled up to    here. And these cowering crowds. And you yourself, Adil, a god of patience,    that's what they say. What could be worse than admitting you're an impotent    god, unable to assert your own rights or anyone else's? The process of ascent    and fall goes on. A god-like ascent to the heights of Mount AIbal. And descent    through seaweed into the gutters and decaying refuse. You search for yourself    in other people's eyes, Adil. You find yourself mirrored in the eyes of    the hungry, the nake, the homeless, those who live in tents. The winds and    storms toss you in all directions. But the will to live still beats within    you, defiant and instinctive. What can you do? Your spirit is bottled up;    it can't find a way out. You experience sorrow, repress your emotions, and    wait. Nevertheless! This mind of yours at least keeps you awake, wards off    the drunkenness of indifference. Your heart rages and storms, yet the energy's    suppressed by the machinery of oppression.&quot; (206)    But unlike the suicide bombers, Adil only thinks the thoughts and then    goes back to his job working for the Israelis: &quot;If only you were more    cruel or harder of heart, you'd blow up everything you could lay hands on,    from the Atlantic to the Gulf and on to the world's furthest reaches. You'd    leave no two stones standing. You'd uproot the trees, exposing the infections    beneath the earth's surface to the light of the sun, to the breezes of spring.    You'd turn everything upside-down. And begin again. Slowly, very slowly.    Here a seedling. There a tree. Here a flower. And you, young Sabir, a tall,    broad-shouldered palm. Your hands would bring rocks from the depths of the    earth and from the mountains. Those stones would shine like raw diamonds.    We could colour them, decorate them, and build them into rows of beautiful    houses that would stretch as far as the eye could see and stand for all    eternity. The soldiers' metal detectors could ring all they liked, we wouldn't    hear them.&quot; (207)    These are the thoughts Adil has as his enormous, ancient family house lays    in ruins, the house that Khalifeh first described as &quot;...a real, old-style    mansion. There were marble pillars, high valuted ceilings and an open courtyard    paved with huge stones. In the middle of the courtyard was a pool, surrounded    by lemon trees and sweet-smelling jasmine. Arabesque plasterwork decorated    the walls, stained glass lanterns reflected the light and the anitque chests    in every room were inlaid with mother-of-pearl.&quot; (33)    As his world crumbles, Adil meditates on the poetry of nuclear terrorism--    to destroy all and begin again. Yet for Adil, he sees it only as a wish-fulfillment,    a dream upon which he would never act. The novel closes as people go about    their business, selling newspapers and other goods, buying vegetables, fruit    and bread, surrendering to the same sad survival that Wiesel's holocaust    victims did. Does Khalifeh give you insights into the souls of these men,    that you don't see in the other two novels?    MARTYR'S CROSSING is Amy Wilentz' first novel. She is a journalist, a chronicler    of Haitian life and politics and an essayist for The New Yorker. She    said in an interview with Kate Manning that the key to writing a novel is    to create at least one character whom everyone will love, so that when he    is not there, you want him back. Now that she has finished the novel, she    feels lost without Doron, George, Marina and Ahmed. She says that she likes    Ahmed the best because he is self-centered, self-important, and based loosely    on a former PLO fighter and Bethlehem politician, who lived in a tent on    a mountain until he was forced to move into an Israeli settlement. Wilentz    said that Marina was the most difficult character to write because she is    the closest to herself. Even though she is a journalist, she tried to put    the politics around the characters' situations so that we never lose our    emotional grip on the story. She says that Doron is not crazy when he dresses    up in Palestinian clothes to search for Marina in Ramallah; it is because    he sees the other side as human that he succumbs to his suicidal situation    at the end. Many of the scenes between George and Marina were similar to    those between Amy and her father. When asked about gender and fiction, Wilentz    said: &quot;MARTYR'S CROSSING is very much a guy's novel. It's full of history    and politics and explosions and what, I'm told, is a rather ripping plot,    amazingly enough, since plot is something I hate thinking about.&quot; (Appendix)    In this cluster we are focusing on character. Note how Wilentz goes against    type and makes Ari Doron, the Israeli border guard, an almost psychotic,    but highly empathic, sensitive, wandering Jew-- wandering into enemy territory    in his Palestinian disguise to get himself killed. See how puny, skinny    and almost wimpy the jailed Hamas leader Hajimi Hassan is. Only Ahmed Amr,    and Yizhar, the Israeli boss, and George Raad, the American/Palestinian    writer/intellectual seem truer to type. When does stereotype work and when    does it become shallow? Can going against type create unbelievable characters    or just reflections of the author? In her effort to go against type has    Wilentz just created mirrors of herself? Does her over-the-shoulder third    person narrator who speaks in the same staccato, verbless sentences for    everyone help or hurt the interior monologues of characterisation? Does    the precipitous inciting incident give you enough time to develop empathy    for Ibrahim, the asthmatic baby? What techniques does she use to enhance    suspense in the thriller structure? Notice the clarity of the central dramatic    question: \"Will Hamas find The Soldier indirectly responsible for Ibrahim's    death?\" and the way Wilentz relentlessly focuses on this question from every    perspective. Wilentz' transparent, communicative style prunes descriptive,    interior monologue, dialogue and diversion to create the forward momentum    of her American style narrative, unlike Rushdie's more coded novel that    requires research into Indian culture, the Koran, immigrant London and his    fertile imagination in order to understand all the allusions. Wilentz is    a perceptive writer, an accomplished journalist who seems to understand    Israel better than Palestine. Based on my trip to Israel in the seventies,    I was particularly impressed with her economical, but brilliant description:    &quot;Doron hated the desert wind: it coated cars with a film of yellow    sand, it go up your nose, it made you cough, and worst of all, it reminded    you that Jerusalem, with its McDonald's and Burger Kings and nice red buses    and nice red post offices and its green gardens and flowering terraces and    public buildings flanked by foundatins, was actually right on the edge of    an ancient desert where camels and cactuses and Bedouins were the only successful    species. &quot; (109)    Contrast the difference in the traditional American suspense structure    of MARTYRS CROSSING with the Arabic narrative of WILD THORNS and the wildly    nonlinear, deconstructionist narrative of SATANIC VERSES, which nevertheless,    has a beginning, middle and end. Note the preponderance of dialogue again    in the Arabic novel, the use of compound words in SATANIC VERSES to accentuate    the &quot;chutneyfication&quot; of language, and the clean, New York nineties    style of MARTYR's CROSSING. See how Rushdie and Wilentz play with good and    evil, while Khalifeh sticks to her political agenda and didacticism, albeit    embedding it in a rich poetic language and imagery.    To clarify the sociopolitical context of this cluster, read the following    speech given by President Bush on June 24, 2002:    &quot;For the sake of all humanity, things must    change in the Middle East. It is untenable for Israeli citizens to live    in terror. It is untenable for Palestinians to live in squalor and occupation.    And the current situation offers no prospect that life will improve. Israeli    citizens will continue to be victimized by terrorists and so Israel will    continue to defend herself. And the situation of the Palestinian people    will grow more and more miserable. My vision is two states living side by    side in peace and security. There is simply no way to achieve that peace    until all parties fight terror. Yet at this critical moment, if all parties    will break with the past and set out on a new path, we can overcome the    darkness with the light of hope. Peace requires a new and different Palestinian    leadership so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian    people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I call upon    them to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty. If    the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world    will actively support their efforts. If the Palestinian people meet these    goals, they will be able to reach agreement with Israel and Egypt and Jordan    on security and other arrangements for independence. And when the Palestinian    people have new leaders, new institutions and new security arrangements    with their neighbors, the United States of America will support the creation    of a Palestinian state, whose borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty    will be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the    Middle East. In the work ahead, we all have responsibilities. The Palestinian    people are gifted and capable. And I'm confident they can achieve a new    birth for their nation. A Palestinian state will never be created by terror.    It will be built through reform. And reform must be more than cosmetic change    or veiled attempt to preserve the status quo. True reform will require entirely    new political and economic institutions based on democracy, market economics    and action against terrorism.    Today the elected Palestinian legislature has    no authority. And power is concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable    few. A Palestinian state can only serve its citizens with a new constitution    which separates the powers of government. The Palestinian parliament should    have the full authority of a legislative body. Local officials and government    ministers need authority of their own and the independence to govern effectively.    The United States, along with the European Union and Arab states, will work    with Palestinian leaders to create a new constitutional framework and a    working democracy for the Palestinian people. And the United States, along    with others in the international community, will help the Palestinians organize    and monitor fair multiparty local elections by the end of the year, with    national elections to follow. Today the Palestinian people live in economic    stagnation made worse by official corruption. A Palestinian state will require    a vibrant economy where honest enterprise is encouraged by honest government.    The United States, the international donor community and the World Bank    stand ready to work with Palestinians on a major project of economic reform    and development. The United States, the E.U., the World Bank and International    Monetary Fund are willing to oversee reforms in Palestinian finances, encouraging    transparency and independent auditing. And the United States, along with    our partners in the developed world, will increase our humanitarian assistance    to relieve Palestinian suffering. Today the Palestinian people lack effective    courts of law and have no means to defend and vindicate their rights. A    Palestinian state will require a system of reliable justice to punish those    who prey on the innocent. The United States and members of the international    community stand ready to work with Palestinian leaders to establish, finance    and monitor a truly independent judiciary. Today Palestinian authorities    are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism. This is unacceptable. And the    United States will not support the establishment of a Palestinian state    until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and    dismantle their infrastructure. This will require an externally supervised    effort to rebuild and reform the Palestinian security services. This security    system must have clear lines of authority and accountability and a unified    chain of command. America is pursuing this reform along with key regional    states.    The world is prepared to help. Yet ultimately    these steps toward statehood depend on the Palestinian people and their    leaders. If they energetically take the path of reform, the rewards can    come quickly. If Palestinians embrace democracy, confront corruption and    firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation    of a provisional state of Palestine. With a dedicated effort, this state    could rise rapidly as it comes to terms with Israel, Egypt and Jordan on    practical issues such as security. The final borders, the capital and other    aspects of this state's sovereignty will be negotiated between the parties    as part of a final settlement. Arab states have offered their help in this    process, and their help is needed. I've said in the past that nations are    either with us or against us in the war on terror. To be counted on the    side of peace, nations must act. Every leader actually committed to peace    will end incitement to violence in official media and publicly denounce    homicide bombings. Every nation actually committed to peace will stop the    flow of money, equipment and recruits to terrorist groups seeking the destruction    of Israel, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah. Every nation actually    committed to peace must block the shipment of Iranian supplies to these    groups and oppose regimes that promote terror like Iraq. And Syria must    choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and    expelling terrorist organizations. Leaders who want to be included in the    peace process must show by their deeds an undivided support for peace.    And as we move toward a peaceful solution, Arab    states will be expected to build closer ties of diplomacy and commerce with    Israel, leading to full normalization of relations between Israel and the    entire Arab world. Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic    Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity in democracy.    A stable, peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to achieve the security    that Israel longs for. So I challenge Israel to take concrete steps to support    the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. Advertisement As    we make progress toward security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to    positions they held prior to Sept. 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations    of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories    must stop. The Palestinian economy must be allowed to develop. As violence    subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians    to resume work and normal life. Palestinian legislators and officials, humanitarian    and international workers must be allowed to go about the business of building    a better future. And Israel should release frozen Palestinian revenues into    honest accountable hands. I've asked Secretary Powell to work intensively    with Middle Eastern and international leaders to realize the vision of a    Palestinian state, focusing them on a comprehensive plan to support Palestinian    reform and institution building. Ultimately Israelis and Palestinians must    address the core issues that divide them if there is to be a real peace,    resolving all claims and ending the conflict between them. This means that    the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 will be ended through a settlement    negotiated between the parties based on U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, with    Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognized borders. We must also resolve    questions concerning Jerusalem, the plight and future of Palestinian refugees    and a final peace between Israel and Lebanon and Israel and a Syria that    supports peace and fights terror.    All who are familiar with the history of the Middle    East realize that there may be setbacks in this process. Trained and determined    killers as we have seen want to stop it. Yet the Egyptian and Jordanian    peace treaties with Israel remind us that with determined and responsible    leadership, progress can come quickly. As new Palestinian institutions and    new leaders emerge, demonstrating real performance on security and reform,    I expect Israel to respond and work toward a final-status agreement. With    intensive effort by all, this agreement could be reached within three years    from now. And I and my country will actively lead toward that goal. I can    understand the deep anger and anguish of the Israeli people. You've lived    too long with fear and funerals, having to avoid markets and public transportation    and forced to put armed guards in kindergarten classrooms. The Palestinian    Authority has rejected your offered hand and trafficked with terrorists.    You have a right to a normal life. You have a right to security. And I deeply    believe that you need a reformed, responsible, Palestinian partner to achieve    that security. I can understand the deep anger and despair of the Palestinian    people. For decades you've been treated as pawns in the Middle East conflict.    Your interests have been held hostage to a comprehensive peace agreement    that never seems to come as your lives get worse year by year. You deserve    democracy and the rule of law. You deserve an open society and a thriving    economy. You deserve a life of hope for your children. An end to occupation    and a peaceful democratic Palestinian state may seem distant. But America    and our partners throughout the world stand ready to help, help you make    them possible as soon as possible.    If liberty can blossom in the rocky soil of the    West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions of men and women around the    globe who are equally weary of poverty and oppression, equally entitled    to the benefits of democratic government. I have a hope for the people of    Muslim countries. Your commitments to morality and learning and tolerance    led to great historical achievements. And those values are alive in the    Islamic world today. You have a rich culture and you share the aspirations    of men and women in every culture. Prosperity and freedom and dignity are    not just American hopes or Western hopes; they are universal human hopes.    And even in the violence and turmoil of the Middle East, America believes    those hopes have the power to transform lives and nations. This moment is    both an opportunity and a test for all parties in the Middle East. An opportunity    to lay the foundations for future peace. A test to show who is serious about    peace and who is not. The choice here is stark and simple. The Bible says:    I have set before you life and death, therefore choose life. The time has    arrived for everyone in this conflict to choose peace and hope and life.    Thank you very much.&quot;    Who are the heroes and martyrs of these novels? How do the relate to their    home and what would they do to defend and protect it? Which character is    the most dangerous, or the most trustworthy?    In keeping with our exploration of role criticism, choose a passage from    each of the three books that reveals character. Note the extensive use of    dialogue in WILD THORNS, creating an indigenous storystelling style in the    oral tradition. You could almost make a play of the book.Note the way the    characters are so grounded in the earth and connected to their home that    you feel as bad when that home is exploded on purpose by the Israelis as    when an innocent person is murdered. The characters' scents and sounds mingle    with the aroma of market goods, the smells of olive trees, the feel of the    dusty desert. But MARTYR'S CROSSING, written by an American, is constructed    with the disciplined, highly literate technique of a New Yorker ficiton    writer, in spite of the extensive research and cross cultural empathy. All    the main characters seem to have the introspection that the female author    has and yet each cause is championed, all are sympathetic. Rushdie's characters    are unbounded, often confusing, amalgamations of reality and fantasy, bigger    than life. Analyze how each writer brings their characters to life.How    far have YOU gone with your alter ego? Do you know their dreams, hopes,    fears, plans, unconscious wishes? Their imperfections? Have you made them    fantastical in some way?What has happened to them during their journey through    all these books? How have they transformed?       Cluster Five: For years my father and brother traded with China    when the U.S. had severed economic ties to the Chinese Communist regime    during Mao's cultural Revolution. My father would come back with librettos    of the Peking Revolutionary Operas, complaining    of the hours he had to spend politely watching them, in order to seem like    an enlightened enough capitalist to close a deal with them. Please look    at some of the    pictures of these operas. When I was studying ballet, I was particularly    drawn to these strong, feminist ballerinas who carried guns as they leapt    through the air instead of dressing up as swans to be lifted by princes    in the western tradition. In many ways, feminism was more completely realized    in China before it came to America. For this reason, I chose Anchee Min's    RED AZALEA,     a description of her time in military farm during the Cultural Revolution    as well as her professional experiences as a performer in the Revolutionary    Opera. Anchee Min was born in Shanghai and lived in China from 1957 to 1984.    During the Cultural Revolution, she was a leader of the Little Red Guards    in elementary school, then she went to a place like the Red Fire Farm, and    finally played a starring role in RED AZALEA, one of Madame Mao's movies.    In 1983 she fled to the U.S. after the death of Mao, the execution of his    wife and the ensuing political turmoil. RED AZALEA received the New Times    Notable Book of the Year award and in 1985, the Carl Sandburg Literary Award.    She lives in California with her daughter where she is a painter, musician,    photographer and novelist. While she is not one of the greatest writers    of the century, RED AZALEA is one of the best memoirs of the Cultural Revolution.    This book is a highly romanticized, Americanized memoir, but it still reveals    much about the SELF vs STATE theme of this cluster.    The objectives of this session are to deepen our understanding of Marxist    criticism, touched on at the beginning with the French existentialists,    in an analysis of the literature post Cultural Revolution in China, and    to enhance our sensitivity to purely descriptive writing, isolating it from    the English idiosyncrasies of linguistic style which we will analyse in    the final cluster. I chose SOUL MOUNTAIN not only because it won the Nobel    Prize but because it represents the matrix of the collective Chinese culture,    Gao Xingjian's forays into individualism and deconstruction with his multiple    protagonist I, she, he, you narrator, and the vast nature and history described    in the long treks through the mountains. It is a book of the future, of    the multicultural mix of the best of self with nature and the state. It    ends with questions, with inquiry, with an openness, as expansive as the    towering mountains. Gao Xingjian makes his living as a painter of ink drawings.    When comparing this work to that of Sartre, who is more confrontational,    discursive and dialectical, do you see how visual Xingjian is, painstakingly    painting one image after the other as he weaves through the mountains? Note    how the effectiveness of the descriptive language of both Xingjian and Min    comes from superior visualization rather than language use as the vocabulary    and syntax are not that remarkable. In fact, in Mabel Lee's translation,    comma splices are rampant and the word choice is fairly mundane; yet the    images created in the brain glow with power and vividness because of the    precise visualization of the authors. Min has a deeper sense of personal    drama the way she relives her relationships with Yan and her colleagues    in the Opera but Xingjian has a sense of the epic, creating a kind of Joycean    Odyssey for Chinese literature. Although Chinese culture, from Confucius    to Mao, is strongly collective, there is a hierarchy in this gigantic organization    and like America, a way for it to abandon religion for a completely secular    government, something that the Islamic world does not often want to do.    While Little Green was ostracized in her culture, a woman like Yan might    not get the love and financial rewards she wants in American culture. What    is the difference between the hypnosis of TV commercials and Red Army slogans?    Americans can theoritically turn the channel but unless one makes peace    with McWorld, financial security and comfort are denied. Chinese communism    was more binary but maybe having intellectuals spend a few months working    in a field is better than just not paying them for anything which is what    often happens in America. As you analyze some of this propaganda and censorship,    take a closer look at how we manipulate thought in the U.S.    Take your alter ego to the prison farm, up the mountains, and through    Chinese vast geography. How does geography change your character? Because    we will not be doing close textual analyses of these books, try to incorporate    form and content, style and story into your presentations and discussion.We    will also discuss the differences between China and the U.S. in terms of    the semiotics of war propaganda, nonverbal communication, and literature's    power and place in the state.While Communist regimes often outlawed or    imprisoned writers, thereby creating dissent, scandal and usually more popularity,    Capitalist countries just ignore many of their great artists, writers and    thinkers who subsequently slip into oblivion.    The micro objective of this cluster is to sensitize us to the descriptive    powers and talents of Min and Xingjian. The imagery is very specific without    being influenced by the oral, sonorous quality of adjectives and adverbs.    Xingjian is an ink and paper artist who paints every scene precisely in    all its dimensions; Min is more of a dramatic writer, intensifying objectives    and obstacles to make her life story more focused and combustive than it    probably was. Nevertheless she uses unusual metaphors and vivid description.    The Chinese language was recorded well before the Gutenberg invention established    written language in the West.Stemming from pictogram to ideogram to vertical    alignment, it stimulates different thought patterns and relationship of    image to action and thought.    While Western languages move from left to right with complex syntax, and    Semitic languages move from right to left with a heavy oral feature, Chinese    language moves up and down. Yet the architecture (Forbidden City of Beijing)    and city planning, the ballet (with the ballerinas caught in horizontal    lines of arabesques and hand-held rifles) create horizontal lines. Mosques    are circular domes while the spires of cathedrals and the modern skyscrapers    are vertical. Middle eastern dance is earthbound as the belly ripples in    circles while Western dance pitches the ballerina on her tip toes in gravity-    defying, illusory, upward bound acts.    What I love most about Chinese civilization are the martial arts, massage,    acupuncture, 5 elements, food, --in other words, the holistic connection    between humans and nature, something we see in the activities at the Red    Fire Farm in Red Azalea, as well as the journeys of the narrator through    the mountains of China. At times he seems to be uncomfortable with &quot;I,&quot;    with naked solitude, so he invents the she, he and you, not only to keep    him company but because Chinese communication begins with a duo or a triad,    never with the naked self.    The Chinese Communication Research scholar and colleague of Professor Keefer,    Jia Wenshen, writes that the &quot;Chinese live in a web of relations, but    this web is vvery insulated and walled. Beyond the web is a world the Chinese    tend to perceive to be generally hostile, harsh, and cold, and thus they    act accordingly....&quot;in the modern West, communication is primarily    concerned with effectiveness of passing objectie information separable form    the human agent as a sender to the human agent as a receiver. In other words,    Chinese communication is conceptualized as a morality-centered activity    to improve members' social behavior, whereas the Western scientific model    of communication is primarily conceptualized as a scientific instrument    to transmit knowledge to other people for the mere sake of knowledge. Communication    in this Western sense is largely detached from moral reasoning or the purpose    of bettering people's social behavior. &quot; Professor Wenshen feels that    Chinese communication research must be consistent with Chinese philosophy--cosmology,    epistemology, ontology, axiology-- and Chinese culture. He focuses on interpersonal    concepts such as face or mianzi, humanness or renquiing, and connections    or guanxi. To understand the political meetings and the history of negotiation    we must understand face. Face is important in politics and literature as    evidenced by the propaganda, posters of Mao and descriptions of face. Wenshen    divides this concept of face into relational, communal/social, hierarchical    and moral components rooted in Confucianism but he is quick to point out    that Confucianism is hierarchal and modern Chinese communication must include    changes made since the uprising in l989 in Tiananmen Square which called    for more democracy and therefore equality in all aspects of life. Professor    Wenshen is writing a book on this which will be useful for international    business students.    Besides analyzing SOUL MOUNTAIN from the stylistic (descriptive precision),    political (Marxist), and deconstructionist points of view, we should also    look at it as a shamanic journey, a more indigneous journey than what Campbell    outlines in his myth studies but with many of the same landmarks and personae    such as Guardians, Warriors etc. See    Myth and the Movies.    For a stronger focus on the cultural revolution, read Xingjian's newly    translated book, ONE MAN'S BIBLE with searing memories of repression under    Mao. Gao Xingjian really won the Nobel Prize for his two novels -- SOUL    MOUNTAIN and ONE MAN'S BIBLE, published in Taiwan in 1999 and recently translated    by Mabel Lee. While SOUL MOUNTAIN is born of the 1980s and is a more mystical,    inquisitive book, ONE MAN'S BIBLE bleeds from the claustrophobia, cruelty    and paranoia of the cultural revolution of the sixties and seventies when    neighbors and families spied on each other, creative people burned their    work and communities were scattered and decimated by re-education, prison    labor, disease and untimely death. In this book he only uses a YOU and a    HE narrator.    This life is described as follows: &quot;...you write simply to indicate    that a sort of life, worse than a quagmire, more real than an imaginary    hell, more terrifying than Judgment Day, has, in fact, existed. Furthermore,    it is very likely that when people have forgotten about it, it will make    a comeback...It is by cloaking naked reality with a gauze curtain, ordering    language and weaving into it feelings and aesthetics that you are able to    derive pleasurre from looking back at it, and are interested in continuing    to write.&quot;    It might be interesting to compare ONE MAN'S BIBLE with RED AZALEA.

In 1962, Mao advocated the Socialist Education Movement (SEM), in an attempt    to 'inoculate' the peasantry against the temptations of feudalism and the    sprouts of capitalism that he saw re-emerging in the countryside. Large    doses of didactic politicized art, whether figurative or literary, were    produced as serum for this inoculation process. The Party organization saw    the initiatives proposed by Mao and his even more radical followers as interfering    with its successful program of economic rehabilitation that had started    after the Great Leap Forward. Given the scope of the problems, the Party    preferred more technocratic solutions and was averse to Mao's millennial    visions. There are no indications that open opposition to Mao actually existed,    although the Chairman believed there was. He was truly convinced that the    more moderate leaders were trying to steal his place in history by subverting    the nature of the revolution he had fought for. In order to reclaim his    rightful place at the apex of power and to oust those he perceived as revisionists,    Mao turned towards the People's Liberation Army, the only organization he    still deemed ideologically correct. Mao already had appeared prominently    on propaganda posters dating back as far as 1950, despite his ambiguous    warnings against a personality cult. The intensity of his portrayal in the    second half of the 1960s, however, was unparalleled. Under Lin Biao, the    PLA increasingly was employed to bolster the personality cult around Mao,    and thus to produce art that would contribute to the construction of Mao's    god-like image. All this took place with Mao's consent. Already before the    compilation of the Quotations from Chairman Mao (Mao zhuxi yulu, the 'Little    Red Book', published in May 1964) for use by the armed forces, the PLA had    been turned into \"a great school of Mao Zedong Thought\". The army became    the driving force behind the campaign to study Mao's Quotations. A study    session with the Quotations \"... supplied the breath of life to soldiers    gasping in the thin air of the Tibetan plateau; enabled workers to raise    the sinking city of Shanghai three-quarters of an inch; inspired a million    people to subdue a tidal wave in 1969, inaccurate meteorologists to forecast    weather correctly, a group of housewives to re-invent shoe polish, surgeons    to sew back severed fingers and remove a ninety-nine pound tumor as big    as a football.\"    The PLA also supplied most of the behavioural models that embodied the    \"spirit of a screw\" (luosiding jingshen) by blindly following the instructions    from the Party and/or superiors and attachment to the larger group. The    best known of these were model soldiers as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Dong Cunrui,    and Ouyang Hai. Logically, the Army became responsible for art. This art    should unite and educate the people, inspire the struggle of revolutionary    people and eliminate the bourgeoisie. Art had to be guided by Mao Zedong    Thought, its contents had to be militant and to reflect real life. Proletarian    ideology, communist morale and spirit, revolutionary heroism were the messages    of a new type of hyper-realism that took precedence over style and technique    and that differed in all aspects from art creation until then. In the PLA    paintings of the time, the color red featured heavily; it symbolized everything    revolutionary, everything good and moral; the color black, on the other    hand, signified precisely the opposite. Color symbolism continued to be    important in the following years, not only in visual propaganda, but in    printed propaganda as well. Mao's wife Jiang Qing supported the artistic    direction set by the PLA. The conceptual dogmas and theatrical conventions    provided by the model operas (yangbanxi) that she supported also became    the standard in the visual arts. For the stage, she formulated the 'three    prominences' (stress positive characters; stress the heroic in them; stress    the central character of the main characters). In the arts, this was translated    as: the subjects were to be portrayed realistically, and they were always    to be in the centre of the action, flooded with light from the sun or from    hidden sources. Moreover, when we look at the propaganda posters of these    years, it always seems as if we, the spectators, are looking upward, as    if the action is indeed taking place upon a stage. The subjects were represented    hyper-realistically, as ageless, larger-than-life peasants, soldiers, workers    and educated youth in dynamic poses. Their strong and healthy bodies functioned    as metaphors for the strong and healthy productive classes the State wanted    to propagate. In line with the egalitarian character of the Maoist culture    of the body, the gender distinctions of the subjects were by and large erasedsomething    that was also attempted in real life. Men and women alike had stereotypical,    \"masculinized\" bodies; they were dressed in cadre grey, army green or worker/peasant    blue; their hands and feet often were absurdly big in relation to the rest    of their bodies; and their faces, including short-cropped hairdos and chopped-off    pigtails, were done according to a limited standard repertoire of acceptable    examples. Even in the many propaganda posters that featured Mao, the Chairman    was subjected to these stylistic dictates. As a result, he appeared as a    muscular super-person. As the Great Teacher, the Great Leader, the Great    Helmsman, the Supreme Commander, Mao came to dominate the propaganda art    of the first half of the Cultural Revolution. His image was considered more    important than the occasion for which a particular work of propaganda art    was designed: in a number of cases, identical posters dedicated to Mao were    published in different years bearing different slogans, i.e., serving different    propaganda causes. Mao could be depicted as a benevolent father, bringing    the Confucian mechanisms of popular obedience into play. Or he was portrayed    as a wise statesman, an astute military leader or a great teacher; to this    end, artists represented him in the vein of the statues of Lenin, which    had started to appear in the early 1920s. Another group of posters visually    recounted the more illustrious of his historical deeds. ...       But no matter how Mao was depicted, he had to be painted hong, guang, liang    (red, bright, and shining); no grey was allowed for shading, and the use    of black was interpreted as an indication that the artist harbored counter-revolutionary    intentions. His face was painted usually in reddish and other warm tones,    and in such a way that it appeared smooth and seemed to radiate as the primary    source of light in a composition. In many instances, Mao's head seemed to    be surrounded by a halo which emanated a divine light, illuminating the    faces of the people standing in his presence. As a super model, every detail    of his representations had to be preconceived along ideological lines and    invested with symbolic meaning. An extreme example of this is the painting-turned    poster Chairman Mao goes to Anyuan. As a consequence of these creative rules    governing the depiction of Mao, the more god-like and divorced from the    masses he became to be portrayed, often hovering above those masses. And    yet, despite this apparent distance, there was something in the Mao images    that struck a chord with the people, something recognizable that turned    him into an EveryMao. Mao somehow remained united with the people, whether    he inspected fields, shook hands with the peasants, sat down with them,    and shared a cigarette with them; whether he inspected factories or infra-structural    works, joked with the workers, and possibly shared a cigarette with them;    whether he was dressed in military uniform, discussing strategy with military    leaders, inspected the rank-and-file, or mingled with contingents of Red    Guards; whether he stood on the bow of a ship, dressed in a terry cloth    bathrobe after an invigorating swim in the Yangzi River; whether he headed    a column of representatives of the national minorities; or received a delegation    of foreign visitors. As the Cultural Revolution unfolded, Mao became a regular    presence in every home, either in the form of his official portrait, or    as a bust or other type of statue. Not having the Mao portrait on display    indicated an apparent unwillingness to go with the revolutionary flow of    the moment, or even a counter-revolutionary outlook, and refuted the central    role Mao played not only in politics, but in the day-to-day affairs of the    people as well. The formal portrait often occupied the central place on    the family altar, or at least the spot where that altar had been located    before it had been demolished by Red Guards in the early days of the Cultural    Revolution. This added to the already god-like stature of Mao as it was    created in propaganda posters.    The days were structured around the ritual of \"asking for instructions    in the morning, thanking Mao for his kindness at noon, and reporting back    at night. &quot;This involved bowing three times, the singing of the national    anthem, reading passages from the Little Red Book in front of Mao's picture    or bust, and would end with wishing him 'Ten thousand years'. In the mornings,    everybody would announce what efforts they would make that day for the revolution.    In the evenings, people would report on their accomplishments or failures    and announce their resolutions for the next day. In the early 1970s, the    extreme and more religious aspects of Mao's personality cult were being    dismantled. In propaganda posters, proxies such as Lei Fengor one of his    reincarnationsand Chen Yonggui (the model Party secretary of Dazhai Commune)    often replaced Mao himself. This did not diminish the adulation of Mao,    who continued to lead the CCP as it was being rebuilt. The excesses committed    by the people during the heyday of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s,    including the embarrassing habit of \"3,000 years of emperor-worshipping    tradition\" which Mao himself had consciously promoted and in which he himself    had basked, were attributed to Lin Biao, who had quite literally fallen    from grace in 1971. Similarly, the Army, the former \"great school of Mao    Zedong Thought\", no longer functioned as a model for the people. Instead,    the \"fine work style\" of the CCP and the masses were what the army needed    to learn from. After the Cultural Revolution, the propagation of the divine    presence and the accomplishments of the supreme leader would never again    be repeated in the same intensity, sophistication, and mind-numbing density.    In the China of economic reforms and Open Door policy, the production of    posters containing ideological exhortations was replaced more and more in    the 1980s by those stressing economic construction, or even ordinary commercial    advertisements. In the early 1990s, a resurgence of the popular belief in    the protective qualities of a truly god-like Mao did take place.    This MaoFever coincided with the marking of the centenary of his birth.    The continued importance of Mao as a political symbol is attested to by    the issuance of a new 100-yuan bank note in 1999 to commemorate the 50th    anniversary of the PRC: the image of a youngish Mao graces the bill. He    moreover appeared in a special series of posters, also showing Deng Xiaoping    and Jiang Zemin (the so-called \"three generations of leaders\"), to mark    the occassion.

The theme is kidnapping,    or being held hostage. In MAO II, De Lillo writes about hostages in Beirut    but on another level, the writer is held hostage to his words, to his writing,    his computer or typewriter. In NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING, the journalists are    held hostage by Escobar's henchmen during the Colombian drug wars; in BLACK    WATER Kelly as Mary Jo is held hostage to The Senator (Kennedy) in a metaphor    for the Chappaquidic scandal. The HOSTAGE story reverses cultural expectations    by focusing on the vulnerability of boy toys as they are seduced by Islamic    princesses in guarded castles.    The purpose of this cluster is to take a common situation, kidnapping,    and examine how it is treated    by American, Colombian, and Islamic writers, male and female, not only in    terms of theme and event, but style, narrative organization, and characterization.    Joyce Carol Oates (born in 1938) had a working-class upbringing in upstate    New York, attended Syracuse and the University of Wisconsin, taught in Canada    where she began a prolific and highly successful writing career, culminating    in her appointment at Princeton University as the Roger S. Berlind Distinguished    Professor of Humanities. The ballad-like BLACK WATER (1992) was nominated    for a Pulitzer Prize. It reimagines the events of Chappaquiddick and the    death of Mary Jo Kopechne through the victim's eyes. Inspired by the interior    monologues in Joyce's ULYSSES and other stream-of-consciousness techniques,    Oates draws us into 26 year old Kelly Kelleher's distorted and damaged consciousness    as she is caught in the slow, repetitious, haunting labyrinth of death.    We are inundated with water at every turn and on every level, giving us    a unique understanding of the process of dying with all its associated memories,    fears and sensuality.    Gabriel Garcia Marquez' opening quote in THE SOLITUDE OF LATIN AMERICA:    \"It is only natural that they insist on measuring us with the yardstick    that they use for themselves, forgetting that the ravages of time are not    the same for all, and that the quest of our own identity is just as arduous    and bloody for us as it was for them. The interpretation of our reality    through patterns not our own serves only to make us ever more unknown, ever    less free, ever more solitary.\" GGM was born in 1928 in Aracataca, Colombia.    He won the Nobel Prize in 1982. The pristine, precise, factual and often    understated style of NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING contrasts remarkably with his    luscious, magical, linguistic jungle spanning ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE.    But like Sartre, Saadawi, Oates, Camus, Rushdie and others, he has the flexibility    to switch from expository journalism or didactic academicism to descriptive,    lyrical or poetic language.    Although DeLillo's style is postmodern in its deconstruction of sentences,    he is also hysterically funny and thought-provoking in his satire on American    cultural and social life. He thinks long and hard about America and the    world, and like Saadawi, Sartre, Camus, Wiesel, Khalifeh, Marquez, Remarque,    and Rushdie, he is not afraid to speak his mind incisively at the risk of    his unpopularity or criticism. Born in 1936, he was brought up in the Fordham    section of the Bronx, playing lots of ball, and studying communication arts    at Fordham. After five years in advertising, he embarked on a prolific,    productive and highly successful career as a novelist which forced him to    live, like Professor Evergreen, in a tiny Manhattan studio with no kitchen    and a broken down bathroom. Of course now he lives somewhere in Westchester--    Evergreen also spends time upstate in New Paltz. After a while the Manhattan    studio becomes its own prison, and writers hostages of McWorld, or penniless    refugees.    It is in MAO II that DeLillo simply and vividly describes his raison d'etre:    \"I am a sentence maker. Like a donut maker, only slower,\" or \"Every sentence    has a truth waiting at the end of it and the writer learns how to know it    when he finally gets there. On one level this truth is the swing of the    sentence, the beat and poise, but down deeper it's the integrity of the    writer as he matches with the language. I've always seen myself in sentences.    I begin to recognize myself, word by word, as I work through a sentence.    The language of my books has shaped me as a man. There's a moral force in    a sentence when it comes out right. It speaks the writer's will to live.\"    When you do the close textual analysis of MAO II, remember what DeLillo    says: \"The words typed on the page have a sculptural quality. They form    odd correspondences. They match up not just through meaning but through    sound and look. The rhythm of a sentence will accomodate a certain number    of syllables. One syllable too many, I look for another word. There's always    another word that means the same thing, and if it doesn't then I'll consider    altering the meaing of a sentence to keep the rhythm, the syllable beat.    I'm completely willing to let language press meaning upon me. Watching the    way in which words match up, keeping the balance in a sentence--these are    sensuous pleasures. I type rather than write longhand because I like the    way words and letters look when they come off the hammers onto the page--finished,    printed and beautifully formed. MAO II is about Bill Gray, a famous, obsessively    reclusive writer who lives with Scott, an alter ego, and his girlfriend    Karen a former Moonie. There is also Brita, a photographer who shoots only    writers, and leads Bill toward a confrontation with his own death.    Phrases like \"The future belongs to crowds,\" are made terrifyingly real    in his desciription of the weddings at the beginning and end of the book.    Even before our current wave of suicide terrorists, DeLillo said that the    death of the individual is necessary to accomplish the objectives of the    terrorist and the mass organization. DeLillo is inspired by images, images    of homeless living in Tompkins Square Park in New York, the Sheffield, England,    soccer tragedy, mourners in Teheran after the death of Khomeini, the Massacre    at Tiananmen Square, images usually mediated by television. When I teach    media studies, I usually include a book by DeLillo, usually WHITE NOISE.    I wonder what he will cook up for 9/11. Opening quote: \"...I do think we    can connect novelists and terrorists here. In a repressive society, a writer    can be deeply influential, but in a society that's filled with glut and    repetition and endless consumption, the act of terror may be the only meaningful    act. People who are in power make their arrangements in secret, largely    as a way of maintianing and furthering that power. People who are powerless    make an open theater of violence. True terror is a language and a vision.    There is a deep narrative structure to terrorist acts, and they infiltrate    and alter consciousness in ways that writers used to aspire to.\" After 9/11    were you more interested in watching the real life drama on TV or in reading    a book or seeing a movie? If terrorists have seized control of the world    narrative, if they have captured the historical imagination, have they become,    the world's new novelists? For sheer influence over the human mind, have    they displaced a precariously placed literature? Are writers--lacking some    greater if lethal faith-- the new hostages?    Mutee'Damaj creates an unusual, unstereotypical hostage situation in THE    HOSTAGE, originally published in 1984, about a youth from the countryside    taken hostage by the ruling Imam's soldiers to perform boy toy services    to the pampered, oppressed older women in the palace, only to fall in love    with the youngest, most beautiful single woman in the palace. Again, we    have more humor than we are used to seeing from western media coverage of    Islamic culture with the toothless women vying for the young studs, the    bestial mule sex episodes, and the desperate flights through the cemetery.    Like the other novels, it makes strong political statements but never at    the expense of the humanity of the characters, the style of the narrative.    It is set in the highlands of Yemen in the late 1940s, towards the end of    the time of the Imams and the beginning of the republican era. Remember    those pictures of Afhganistan? Well, this was worse, (or better if you are    an ecospiritualist): no piped water, surfaced roads, cars or engines, electricity,    telephones or radios. In terms of religious fundamentalism, these Yemeni    were akin to the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt, which many later joined, an    Arab old boys clique that nurtured the likes of Osama's colleague, Zawahiri    and possibly Mohammed Atta. THE HOSTAGE gives you an in-depth portrait of    the palace corruption with a new twist-- women abusing boys.    Cluster 6 looks at the concept of kidnapping, hostage-taking and the theater    of terrorism. Is Kelly a kind of hostage to the Senator? Think of recent    hostage situations with the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl and the stand-off    at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (spring 2002). How would YOU    feel as a hostage? How does Marquez treat the situation differently from    DeLillo? Although DeLillo is a superb stylist, he is as committed to content    as much as any of our writers in this course: \"My own personal preference    is for fiction that is steeped in history, that takes account of ways in    which our perceptions are being changed by events around us. Global events    that may alter how we live in the smallest ways.\"A kidnapping or hostage-taking    is an excellent plot device because of the built-in conflict, enforced relationship,    expectation and time deadline. Who would your character most hate to be    kidnapped by? How would your character react and change under a hostage    situation?       When you write your 9/11 memoir in the voice of your alter ego, feel free    to break into poetry. Billy Collins, Poet Laureate and adjunct Professor    in our program at NYU delivered the following poem to the 9/6/02 Congressional    meeting in Manhattan.    The Names    by Billy Collins    Yesterday, I lay awake in the palm of the night.    A fine rain stole in, unhelped by any breeze,    And when I saw the silver glaze on the windows,    I started with A, with Ackerman, as it happened,    Then Baxter and Calabro,    Davis and Eberling, names falling into place    As droplets fell through the dark.       Names printed on the ceiling of the night.    Names slipping around a waterby bend.    Twenty-six willows on the banks of a stream.       In the morning I walked out barefoot    Among thousands of flowers    Heavy with dew like the eyes of tears,    And each had a name--    Fiori inscribed on a yellow petal    Then Gonzalez and Han, Ishikawa and Jenkins.       Names written in the air    And stitched into the cloth of the day.    A name under a photograph taped to a mailbox.    Monogram on a torn shirt,    I see you spelled out on storefront windows    And on the bright unfurled awnings of this city.    I say the syllables as I turn on a corner--    Kelly and Lee,    Medina, Nardella, and O'Connor.       When I peer into the woods, I see a thick tangle where letters are hidden       As in a puzzle concocted for children.    Parker and quigley in the twigs of an ash,    Rizzo, Schubert, Torres, and Upton,    Secrets in the boughs of an ancient maple.       Names written in the pale sky.    Names rising in the updraft amid buildings.    Names silent in tone    Or cried out behind a door.    Names blown over the earth and out to sea.       In the evening--weakening light, the last swallows.    A boy on a lake lifts his oars.    A woman by a window puts a match to a candle--    And the names are outlined on the rose clouds--    Vanacore and Wallace,    (let X stand, if it can, for the ones unfound)    Then Young and Ziminsky, the final jolt of Z.       Names etched on the head of a pin.    One name spanning a bridge, another undergoing a tunnel.    A blue name needled into the skin.    Names of citizens, workers, mothers and fathers,    The bright-eyed daughter, the quick son.    Alphabet of names in green rows in a field.    Names in the small tracks of birds.    Names lifted from a hat    Or balanced on the tip of the tongue.    Names wheeled into the deep warehouse of memory.    So many names, there is barely room on the walls of the heart.    Read before Congress on September 6, 2002 in commemoration of the \"names\"    of those lost on September 11, 2001.                Too real for fiction ... the South tower of the World Trade Centre beginning to collapse.

How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence. Promised: By the end of the class, you will have been able to  comprehend this course description. Prepare to be reset! Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The course begins with the pre-Romanesque and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Classicism periods. The major focus will be on 19th and 20th Century architectural styles from Historicism and Art Nouveau through Cubism, Art-D\u00e9co, Avant-garde Functionalism, post-war Stalinist art and architecture, and the contemporary. It's necessary to have an understanding of the evolution of Mid European art and architecture, town planning and theory.

The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

NYU Stern students may take this course as a third Stern course at NYU Prague.   NYU College of Arts and Sciences Economics Department Students: Please note this course CANNOT be taken for major or minor credit.   The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.   Sample syllabus                                  College Core Curriculum                                                  Cultures and Contexts: Russia - Between East &amp; West - CORE-UA 9510 - 4 points                               Russia\u2019s rich and multifaced cultural identity has been shaped in a thousand year long process of interaction with a range of diverse cultural formations of the \u2018West\u2019 and \u2018East\u2019 (including Byzantine/ Christian \u2018East\u2019, Central Asian/Muslim \u2018East\u2019, South Asian/Indian \u2018East\u201d, and East Asian/Confucian \u2018East\u2019). For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.   Sample syllabus                                Comparative Literature                                                  Kafka and his Contexts - COLIT-UA 9136 and SASEM-UG 9401 - 4 points                               &quot;A book must be an ax for the frozen sea in us,&quot; wrote Franz Kafka (1883-1924), one of the best known but least understood authors of our times. In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Imagining America, Imagining Europe-\u00a0EURO-UA 9173 - 4 points                               This class is devoted not only to a &quot;close reading&quot; of the selected texts, but also to relevant broader issues. While the approach and methods are interdisciplinary, the main emphasis is on literary theory (explaining and applying basic literary terms), literary history (both American and European), and literary criticism (analyzing different responses to given works). Every class starts with the oral presentation delivered by a student, then there is a short lecture by the teacher, and a discussion follows.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.

This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.

Students will consider numerous issues of city planning and growth. Topics will include patterns of cultural distinctiveness, the influence of ethnic and religious concerns, and the political implications apparent in architectural design, neighborhood development, housing policies, and public space.

The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Several forms and techniques will be explored through lecture, discussion and assignments, including: news reports, interviews, reviews (film, literature, theater), feature stories, essays, and commentaries. During the course, students will learn not only about Prague's cultural landscape but they will be encouraged to examine it in various journalistic and literary forms. One of the leading aims of this courses is also to introduce to them six extraordinary persons, whose work in their respective areas reached international attention.

Students will read and discuss contemporary reporting and famous reportage from the past, listen to foreign correspondents and write their own stories. By the end of the course students should have a good understanding of foreign reporting and will be well equipped with some of the practical skills necessary to follow it as a career.

Global Media Seminar: East-Central Europe - JOUR-UA 9505 and MCC-UE 9453 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

Students will read, watch, analyze and discuss a variety of text specific commercials. Attention will be devoted also to the impact of advertising on the post-communist world and to the ways by which cultural issues are framed and kept in mind in the media discourse. The main objective is to provide an introductory course that is meaningful and of practical importance to students. The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.

Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension.

Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Czech and Slovak Modern History in the Central European Context - POL-UA\u00a09994 - 4 points                               This course tells the story of the region in the geographical trap between Germany and Russia. The establishment of Czechoslovakia, the post-WW II expulsion of the German minority, Stalinism, the Prague Spring of 1968, dissident movements, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, transition to democracy, V\u00e1clav Havel and the post-Havel era will all be studied. Students will gain basic knowledge on Central European political, historical and economic issues. Critical reading of sources and independent thinking required.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Germany and East Central Europe (1871-2000) - HIST-UA9514 or POL-UA 9515 - 4 points                               This course will focus on the history of the culturally rich region of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; through analysis of the parallel evolution of Germany and the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                              Religious Studies                                                  Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe -\u00a0RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points                               Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.   Sample syllabus                                Russian and Slavic Studies                                                    Contemporary Central and East European Literature: From Kafka to Kundera -\u00a0RUSSN-UA 9832 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is not to bring a full and detailed picture of the whole of modern and contemporary Central and East European literature into perspective, but rather to take advantage of the unique occasion to offer students a more focused view. Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.   Sample syllabus                              Sociology                                                  Collective Identity in a Totalitarian Regime -\u00a0SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course examines the totalitarian oppression from the point of view of ordinary citizens in communist Czechoslovakia. It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Contemporary Issues in Law: Law and Human Rights in Central Europe - SOC-UA 9413 - 4 points                               This course explores the development of the rule of law and human rights issues in post-communist Central Europe. We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

The objective is not   just to enhance understanding and appreciation of literature and the skills   to analyze literature, but to see literature embedded within the entire global   spectrum, a useful exercise for non-majors in business, media, communication   and even health science. Students will be introduced to a wide range and depth   of material from all over the world and be asked to read and write critically and creatively on a weekly basis. It is just as important to have analyze the material closely, as it is to interact creatively with the literature. The point of alter ego monologues is to allow students   to enter another life subjectively as well as objectively, and to explore   a perspective and culture different from their own. Creative writing majors can prepare a portfolio deconstructing the literature, business, political and social science majors can design a project that explores the marriage between literature and their field of interest.     This course can also include classics like Aristotle's Poetics to analyze definitions of terror, the Apocalypse or Revelation section from the Bible, and Shakespearean plays such as Richard III.

Through oral interpretation of the texts we will analyze the musicality, phrasing, syntax, and vocabulary of the various authors.   Course Requirements: You must do   close textual analyses every other week uploaded to FILES for the cyberspace   sessions, creative writing alter ego monologues through the same books for   the meatspace sessions, and two oral presentations for the meatspace sessions,   including primary and secondary sources which will grow into an 8-10 page   final paper. The alter ego monologues will grow into an 8-16 page webfolio.   Grading: You will be given Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory   for the weekly assignments, but letter grades for the close textual analyses, oral presentations and   creative webfolios. The last day will involve a skit with role playing as   alter egos. The creative webfolios and oral presentations make up 50% of the   grade; participation, attendance, and WEEKLY assignments make up the other   50.   Method of Instruction:    Cyberspace Sessions will consist of uploading Close Textual Analyses   into FILES. Choose a passage, at least one page, from each book in that cluster,   write it out triple spaced; then analyse it in terms of language, vocabulary,   sentence structure, paragraph organization, figures of speech, rhythm, narrative   voice, characterization, relationship of dialogue to description, relationship   to plot, structure and rest of novel or play, cultural implications and other   extrinsic factors related to politics, philosophy, geography etc. Keep all   your analyses, usually three, in one document and upload to FILES. Cross edit   each other's work. We will have frequent discussions in the listserv about   the books, the analyses, and related topics.    Meatspace Sessions will consist of creative role playing based on monologues   you write in your character's voice, oral presentations on each of the authors,   viewing of pertinent audio-visual material, and discussion and lectures on   cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary issues related to the global literature.     Required Reading: Books are organized into seven clusters   for the meatspace classes. Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman is daily   meditation. Bring it to the first class. Clusters will be reworked with the addition of contemporary literature.   Cluster One: No Exit by Jean-Paul Sartre, The Plague by Albert   Camus,   Cluster Two :All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque,   Night by Elie Wiesel   Cluster Three: The Day The Leader Was Killed by Naguib Mahfouz, God   Dies by the Nile by Nawal el Saadawi, and War in the Land of Egypt   by Yusuf al-Qa'id, Un-clashing Civilizations by Julia Keefer, from How to Survive as an Adjunct Professor by Wrestling   Cluster Four: Wild Thorns by Sahar Khalifeh, Martyr's Crossing   by Amy Wilentz, Satanic Verses or Fury by Salman Rushdie   Cluster Five: Red Azalea by Anchee Min, Soul Mountain or One   Man's Bible by Gao Xingjian    Cluster Six:Mao II by Don DeLillo, News of a Kidnapping by Gabriel   Garcia Marquez, The Hostage by Zayd Mutee'Damaj, Black Water by Joyce Carol Oates   Attendance/Participation Policy: The professor is not in   a position to evaluate excuses so do not give her any. Weekly reading and   writing assignments are clearly listed. If you fall drastically behind, a   medically documented incomplete is possible but not recommended. Since you   can access this course any time, anywhere, there should be no reason why you   cannot complete assignments. If you have to miss a class, check SYLLABUS and   OUTLINE as well as printed lectures, and email class listserv for any other   problems. No one expects you to be perfect but you must write and read, and   then ask questions if you don't understand.

They survived it; so can we. In this course we will define terrorism the way   the Arabs define it, as any organized violence, by an individual, group or   state, legitimate or illegitimate, against a civilian population, either intentional   or unintentional. Because this is about twentieth and twenty first century   literature, we will include the two World Wars with All Quiet on the Western   Front, Night , No Exit, The Plague about Algerian terror as well   as the German occupation and natural scourges, to Islamic militant terrorism   in Egypt in The Day The Leader Was Killed, Satanic Verses, God Dies by   the Nile and War in the Land of Egypt, t o Israeli/Palestinian terror   in Martyr's Crossing and Wild Thorns, to the terror of hostage-taking   and kidnapping in Mao II, News of a Kidnapping, and The Hostage, to the terror   of totalitarian regimes such as China in Red Azalea and Soul Mountain.    Black Water is both a personal and stylistic meditation on terror as   well as an indirect indictment of the terror a powerful political leader has   over an innocent civilian. Because one objective of fiction/drama is to create   a combustive drama for the reader's catharsis, literature and terrorism are   really competing with each other. Sometimes real life provides so much terror   that the reader hides in literature for escape, seeking fantasy, happy endings,   funny, harmless stories that eschew the turmoil of an unlivable situation.   Often cultures will move through a transformation like New York did after   9/11, moving from the transformation of reality into tragedy with heroic stories,   to silly, innocuous escapes, to some social comedy, and finally to stories   that deal with fictional terror. No one can take too much of one thing. When   New Yorkers were coughing from the smoke and toxins downtown, they did not   go to the movies to see sci fi representations of Manhattan blowing up. Enough   is enough.   But literature is different from film because we can choose   when and how often to put the book down. Instead of watching a naturalistic   representation, we recreate the story in our minds to excite, soothe or incite   us. Many of the writers we will study had personal experience of a world war,   the holocaust, the Israeli checkpoints, prison for their writings or gender   brutality such as clitorectomies. Some could not write for years afterwards;   others wrote on toilet paper in prison. It is significant that terrorism demands   a certain amount of intelligence in order to achieve its devastating effect.   Formalist agenda about character, plot, style/language, theme, setting/geography,   descriptive techniques and narrative point of view must be supplemented and   developed to deal with how \"literature engages with contemporary critical   understandings of nationalism, race, gender, sexuality, global multiculturalism...\"   I would add cyberspace to the list. I also believe that it is stultifying   to repress critical reflection on difference to be politically correct. Not   only does it make us oblivious to the richness of difference, but we also   lose our sense of humor.   One of the most influential persons of the twentieth century   was Albert Einstein, not only for his theories on relativity, but because   he revolutionized the way humans perceive time and space in all domains from   art and literature to atomic warfare. The twentieth century novelbroke with   traditional structures as it questioned the linearity of time, the certainty   of empirical relality, and the \"reality\" of the external word by focusing   on stream of consciousness techniques, interior monologues and a nonlinear   use of time/space.James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust were the   innovators of this new novel, but we see their influence in the works of Joyce   Carol Oates BLACK WATER , Gao Xingpian's SOUL MOUNTAIN , Don DeLillo's    MAO II and Salman Rushdie's SATANIC VERSES .   No Exit is a good way to explore basic dramaturgy: unities   of time, space and action, character conflict (different objectives) and orchestration,   crisis/climax/resolution, and relationship of theme, HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE,   to central dramatic question, WHAT KIND OF HELL WILL EACH PERSON EXPERIENCE?   In terms of content, it deals with the German occupation of France during   world war II, and the Empire drawing room satirizes the stultifying life of   the French bourgeoisie in contrast to the new Marxism Sartre probably misunderstood.   It is the most accessible introduction to the philosophy of existentialism,   existence precedes essence, in contrast to the Cartesian saying, \"I think,   therefore I am.\" Sartre was a prolific writer of fiction, drama, literary   theory and philosophy.He popularized existentialism with sayings such as   \"I am therefore I think,\" &quot;Man is nothing more than the sum of his actions,&quot;   and \"Hell is other people.\" We will act out scenes from his brilliant, provocative,   well-structured play,   NO EXIT, to be found on my website.During the anthrax scare in the Fall   of 2002, students identified with the characters and situations in Camus'    The Plague .Both works are essential to an understanding of their   times, and yet they transcend their times so that they speak to us now in   the darkest moments of our war on terror. The Plague introduces us   to the formal elements that make a good novel, the third person narrative   that clinically but compassionately describes the struggles of Dr. Rieux to   help Oran survive the plague. Unlike drama, description and narration assume   paramount importance as the world transforms from before plague, to plague,   to post-plague. If we recall the anthrax attacks after 9/11, we remember how   easily Manhattan could be transformed into Oran. This is also as wonderful   study in character transformation as each person's true character is revealed   when he is confronted with the existential dilemma of possible or imminent   death.   While No Exit is a battle of individuals, The Plague   charts the growth, collapse and renewal of a community through a skillful,   meticulous attention to description and narration, the chief elements of novel   writing. Each culture has different expectations regarding characters, plausibility,   and levels of introspection, censorship, conformity to cultural values, as   well as the kinesthetic thrust of the drama. Western dramatic structure is   more linear, moving to that one big climax, while Arabic literature is recursive,   with many climaxes. American literature often wants \"three-dimensional\" characterization   and transformation while Arabic literature can sometimes go for good versus   evil. Spanish rhetoric/narrative styles are more circumlocutious, less direct.   Indian writers are often more diverse, layered, even chaotic than Arabic ones.   Rushdie versus Saadawi. Is this because of the pluralism of their religion   versus Islam's relentless monotheistic focus? Contemporary American audiences   expect a higher degree of plausibility, unless dealing with science fiction.   Yet there is much cross cultural influence. Oates' Black Water is as   recursive and thematic as an Arabic poem. DeLillo's Mao II has the   plurality, variety in tone, playful satire and chaos of a Rushdie work.   Martyr's Crossing is written in the same studied, skillful style as many   New Yorker fiction pieces. And most significantly, Soul Mountain combines   the reflective, vast space of pre-modern China with the effects of the repressive   Communist regime and then a deconstructed narrator, an I, she, he, you, who   plows through these mountains with the introspection of a French postmodern   writer. Perhaps that is one reason it won the Nobel Prize. What makes cultures   different? History, geography, ethnicity, language. But adaptation and change   occurs in response to the land, to the struggle for survival. Arabs are desert   peoples. In the desert the people see forever; their God is the sun, their   enemy excessive dryness. The vast mountains of China created a collective   culture in contrast to the vast mountains of America where ambitious individuals   forged a frontier through the wilderness, killing the indigenous people. So   as our cultures mix and mingle, delicious new concoctions of literature will   be created. The point of this course is to preserve the distinctness, the   diversity and the difference of cultural flavors, rather than looking at the   more homogeneous products of American mass culture with which we are already   familiar. By studying the narratives of diverse people we come to an empathy   and understanding for \"the other,\" so that we are not trapped in that good   versus evil, us versus them, binary crusade of many American politicians.   Major Twentieth Century Writers is a course in cross-cultural   communication as well as literary analysis. Ask yourselves why members of   some cultures seek solitude, whereas those of others feel sad or even incomplete   if they are not continuously in the company of other people? Why do some cultures   worship the Earth, whereas other molest it? Why do some cultures seek material   possession while other believe they are a hindrance to a peaceful life? Are   some cultures more visual, kinesthetic, linguistic, rhythmic than others?   As we analyze different styles of communication and expression, we weave a   fine line between political correctness and legitimate diversity, homogeneity   from the global melting plot, and specific differences that foster both creativity   and a combustive clash of civilisations.   ALTER EGOS: It   is important you have a subjective as well as a scholarly experience of this   great, global literature and therefore, each student will choose an alter   ego, a major character from one of the books who will journey with you through   the literature, enjoying the different countries and cultures, and perhaps   changing the plot by falling in love with one of the characters or creating   havoc, mayhem or good. Pick a character from a book you love but try to choose   someone whose culture, religion and/or gender are different from your own.   Find out as much as you can about the character and then let your imagination   and experiences through the other novels transform the character to your liking.   If you are confused, see what past students have done with their characters   in the webfolios at twenty/twenty.html,   ORAL PRESENTATIONS/RESEARCH PAPERS: Choose two of the   authors to compare and contrast, perhaps related to your alter ego. Read the   books carefully but also do internet and library research on a dilemma, looking   at the works embedded in their sociocultural context, using both primary and   secondary sources and focusing on literary theory, intellectual history, political   or military or religious issues, depending on your major and interests. Make   sure you have a clearly stated thesis that you develop through argumentation   and close textual analysis. For example, if your major is religion/philosophy,   you might want to analyze the Rushdie affair. Students will have a meatspace   class for their oral presentations, and are encouraged to use audiovisual   aids as well. Last year Jane Schreck did a middle eastern dance and brought   in her costumes, films and photos as she led us into a deeper understanding   of the world depicted in Nawal el Saadawi's writings.   CLOSE TEXTUAL ANALYSES: Every   other week we will upload close textual analyses from the assigned books.   Choose a few paragraphs from each book, copy them down triple spaced and anlyse   every work for implicit and explicit meaning, structure, relationship to the   whole etc. We may have related assignments such as writing a short memoir   or poem to help you further understand the microcosmic aspects of the literature.     .      OUTLINE    This course is organized into six distinct sections, each with a macro    (sociological, historical, philosophical, psychological aspects) and micro    component (the text itself.)    Cluster 1: One of the most important figures of the twentieth century    was Albert Einstein. Not only did he revolutionize science with his theory    of relativity, but literature, art, philosophy were all transformed by our    nonlinear views of time and space. The novel of James Joyce, Virginia Woolf    and Marcel Proust played with time, memory, and space in creative ways undreamt    of in previous centuries and cultures. With film, art and contemporary literature    we have poked holes in the unities of time and space, opening up narrative    to infinite possibilties. Throughout the semester let your imagination play    with time and space in your own lives. I have chosen Alan Lightman's EINSTEIN'S    DREAMS as your nightly bible.    Read a chapter every night before bed and meditate on that timespace change.    For more ideas on Einstein, go to twenty/zeller.html    or twenty/einstein1.html.    As you analyze the books, pay special attention to the use of time and space.    Alan Lightman was born in 1948 in Memphis, Tennessee. Lightman says that    ever since he was a child he built rockets and wrote poetry. He majored    in physics at Princeton, reasoning it was easier to be a scientist turned    writer than the other way around. In 1974 he received his doctorate in theoretical    astrophysics from Caltech in 1974. Between 1976 and 1899 Lightman taught    astronomy and physics at Harvard, moving to MIT in 1989 because there he    was given the chance to teach both of his loves--as a physicist and as the    director of the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies. Lightman credits    Rushdie and Marquez, two other writers on our list, for influencing his    work because they are writers who distort reality to see it more clearly.    He also enjoys reading writers from other cultures, so he can enter worlds    unlike his own. He tries to bring readers into the scientific world in EINSTEIN'S    DREAMS which he wrote in 1991 at his summer home on a small island off the    coast of Maine.    Our first cluster will examine THE PLAGUE by Albert Camus and NO EXIT by    Jean-Paul Sartre. On the macro level, we want to get an introduction to    Existentialism and the new Marxism and to how these great writers used literature    to further their ideologies; on the micro level we want to examine the works,    through close textual analysis, to see how the form of a play differs intrinsically    from that of a novel. Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was born into a well-to-do,    highly educated family and graduated first in his class in philosophy from    the Ecole Normale Superieure, one of the most schools in Europe. He met    Simone de Beauvoir, the second wave French feminist, and thus began a life-long    partnership. Sartre was greatly influenced by German philosphers such as    Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers, Edmund Husserl, thinkers    who questioned the existence of God, universal truth, immortal life and    many accepted &quot;truths&quot; of Western civilisation, in favor of a    more phenomenological approach to existence. During the Enlightenment, the    French philosopher Rene Descartes said, &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;    Sartre is quoted as saying, &quot;I am, therefore I think;&quot; in other    words, existence precedes essence, hence the name Existentialism. What this    means is that human consciousness develops as a response to phenomena in    the &quot;real&quot; world, as opposed to more Platonian ideals of consciousness    coming from man's soul or a higher being.    Sartre spent 1933-34 in Germany and when he returned he wrote his book    NAUSEA. Like many twentieth century intellectuals, he also had his stint    in prison, in a German prisoner-of-war camp in 1940. When he was released    in 1941, he became part of the French resistance against the German occupation,    and sought to combine his Existentialist theories of human individuality    and freedom with the collective responsibility of the new Marxism. Death,    without the hope of eternal life, creates anxiety but forces man to act    in the present, to make hard choices, to exercise his freedom, so that he    carves out a life, that is in essence, the sum of his actions. But this    existential philosophy should not make a man more selfish, but more responisible;    his choices must include a responsibility for humanity as well as himself.    In this respect Existentialism is a Humanism , the title of another of Sartre's    works. I use the pronoun &quot;he,&quot; because Sartre did, although his    partner was a strong feminist.    I received a Master's degree in French Literature from the Sorbonne in    Paris at a time when Sartre, Camus and the influence of existentialism on    the theatre of the absurd was most in vogue, before the post-structuralists    and postmodernists like Foucault, Derrida, Kristeva and Barthes had taken    over Parisian intellectual life. In fact my specialty was theatre of the    absurd and the title of my thesis was &quot;La Chute de la Tradition Theatrale,&quot;    which involved an analysis of the aesthetic as well as philosophical distinctions    between classical dramaturgy and theatre of the absurd such as Eugene Ionesco,    Samuel Beckett and others, and how the media of television and film had    forced an anti-naturalist trend on the theatre. I also performed in French    theatre as I was completing my degree there. NO EXIT has a classical structure    with existentialist themes, so it is different from works by Ionesco and    Becket.    Albert Camus (1913-1960) was born in Algeria to a poor, working class family    but because of his talent and brilliance, received distinction in philosophy    at the University and moved to Paris. He published THE STRANGER in 1942,    about an existential, alienated protagonist Meursault who murders a man,    for no apparent reason, and who is subsequently condemned to death. It is    as much an indictment of capital punishment and society's social norms as    it is an existentialist narrative, written in sparse, pristine prose. In    1947 he published THE PLAGUE, charting the inception, process and resolution    of this disease in a fictional North African town. It is a metaphor of the    German occupation during World War II but could apply to any event. During    the anthrax lockdowns after 9/11 last semester, students identified strongly    with this novel, with the different responses to the epidemic, and with    the personification of the disease and its devastation. After 9/11, we New    Yorkers know how it feels to be in a lockdown. Like Sartre, Camus was aware    of the social/cultural/psychological constraints of existentialism, but    he was more religious or spiritual. My professors at the Sorbonne thought    that he would have become more and more Catholic had he not been killed    in a car accident at 46. In fact, Sartre and Camus did split and dissociate    from each other after the war.    Both were prolific writers, spreading their energies across novels, short    stories, essays, plays and expository books, which is one reason why Existentialism    became a popular movement. However, I feel that Sartre was more gifted as    a dramatic and argumentative writer, and Camus as a novelist and lyrical    essayist.    Read NO EXIT    (it's all online, don't buy it ) and THE PLAGUE together for comparison    and contrast. Note that they both adhere to unities of time, space and action,    although THE PLAGUE takes a little longer to unwind. NO EXIT conforms to    Aristotelian dramaturgy on most levels. It is simply the conversations of    three newly deceased characters, coward Garcin, lesbian Inez, and baby-killer    Estelle in hell, which is a Louis XIV drawing room. They are waiting to    see when hell will begin until they finally realize that &quot;Hell is other    people.&quot; There are no mirrors: they must look into each other's eyes    for all self-affirmation and approval. And here is the rub because each    character wants and needs something from the others that they cannot give    him or her. NO EXIT is an excellent example of how interpersonal conflict    is combusted into intense, riveting dramatic action. Every stage is carefully    orchestrated until the door opens-- and no one can escape. There are unable    to exercise their human freedom to choose. But the hell is in essence, of    their own choosing, because they lack the strength of the existentialist    hero who can become the sum of his actions.    Working only with dialogue, the bourgeois drawing room and a few limited    props, Sartre is able to create a play that continues to be performed all    over the world as a great work of theatre, as well as a mouthpiece for the    chief tenets of Existentialism. The play was originally commissioned as    something short and easy to take on tour, with no changes in scenery and    only three actors. Sartre was also asked to ensure that none of the three    actors felt jealous of the other two by being forced to leave the stage    or getting the best lines; consequently, he began to think in terms of a    situation where three characters would be locked up together--first, in    a cell during an air raid, and then in hell. In this inferno, &quot;hell    is other people,&quot; because Estelle sees no truth, Joseph hears no truth,    and Inez speaks no good, according to former student Jerry Harman. In contrast,    THE PLAGUE uses methodical description and precise narration to suck us    into another hell, that of a population avoiding and finally facing the    ravages of the plague. This is a brilliant sociological study, of how characters    work with and against each other to fight a common evil. Dr. Rieux is like    Giuiliani after 9/11, making himself stronger by administering to the needs    of the population, working night and day with that indefatigable Hizzoner    energy.    Note how important descritive writing is to the art of the novel. Sartre    often lacks the patience to describe as thoroughly as Camus, preferring    to whip and hack and demolish his world with dramatic and philosophical    conflict. Camus documents, describes and patiently recreates a world palatable    to all our senses, a world that is often a metaphor for some philosophical    injusitice or condition he would rather not attack directly through expository    writing. Yet he focuses on the community more than the unconscious exploration    of the characters.    Since you need to pick a character to play for the semester, you might    enjoy playing any one of the characters in these two great works. For the    close textual analysis assignment, pick passages from the two books to analyze    to show the difference between dialogue and description aesthetically, the    main difference between a play and a novel.       I chose the books in Cluster Two,  ALL    QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and NIGHT, to give us a better understanding    of the World Wars on the macro level, and the effect of memoir or naturalistic    memory on the historical/political novel on the micro level. The tradition    of naturalism in literature was fortified in the second half of the nineteenth    century with the works of Emile Zola and the Victorians. For the first time,    readers wanted to see reality with all its warts, and not use literature    for escape, romance or entertainment. These books are in this tradition    although they have more twentieth century aesthetic and psychological dimensions.    ALL QUIET documents the trench warfare of World War I where soldiers were    in another kind of hell for months at a time, fighting against young men    for reasons they did not really understand.    NIGHT documents the holocaust and what it took to survive the concentration    camps. Both books were drawn from personal experience. Both Remarque and    Wiesel suffered, in part, from post traumatic stress syndrome from their    experiences during these terrible wars. For a time they ran away from their    suffering, and were not able to catharsize their pain fully until these    books were published.    Elie Wiesel is the author of 36 works dealing with Judaism, the Holocaust    and the moral responsibility of all people to fight hatred, racism and genocide.    Born 1928 in Romania, Wiesel led a religious, communal life until 1944 when    he and his family were deported by the Nazis and sent to concentration camps.    The following words were written with his blood, embedded forever in his    memory: \"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which    has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times    sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little    faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath    a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith    forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me,    for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments    which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall    I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself.    Never.\" Is this how you feel about 9/11? What are your memories of the event?    What is your \"night?\" But it was Wiesel's steely will to survive that enabled    him to leave Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Gleiwitz after the liberation in    1945 and eventually study at the Sorbonne, which nurtured the French writers,    Gao Xingjian and your illustrious Professor Evergreen. Wiesel became chairman    of the President's Commission on the Holocaust and was awarded the Congressional    Gold Medal of Achievement.    In May 7,2002, Wiesel wrote a letter to George W. Bush just before Ariel    Sharon's arrival in Washington with the following pleas:    &quot;Please remember that a majority of Israelis favor a Palestinian State    alongside Israel if the terror is stopped, whereas a majority of Palestinians,    including Yasir Arafat support suicide killing operations against Israel.    Please remember that while Palestinian Terrorists were hiding explosives    in ambulances, Israeli reservists in Jenin were taking up collections out    of their own funds to repay Palestinian families for the damage done to    their homes. Please remember that the maps on Arafat's uniform and in Palestinian    children's textbooks show a Palstine encompanssing not only all of the West    Bank but all of Israel, while Palestinian leaders loudly proclaim that 'Palestine    extends from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, from Rosh Hanikra    (in the North) to Rafah (in Gaza). Please remember Danielle Shefi, a little    girl in Israel. Danielle was give. When the murderers came, she hid under    her bed. Palestinian gunmen found and killed her anyway. Think of all the    other victims of terror in the Holy Land. With rare exceptions, the targets    were young people, children and families. Please remember that Israel--having    lost too many sons and daughters, mothers and fathers--desperately wants    peace. It has learned to trust its enemies' threats more than the empty    promises of 'neutral' governments. Today, more than ever, Israel must be    trusted to decide what concessions are or are not possible within the framework    of its own security. Please remember that Ariel Sharon, a military man who    knows the ugly face of war better than anyone, is ready to make 'painful    sacrifices' to end the conflict. In fact it was he who carried out the handing    over of Yamit, displacing thousands of Israelis, in exchange for peace with    Egypt. Please remember that while Israelis mourned alongside us for our    nation's tragedy on September 11th, Yasir Arafat was busy suppressing footage    of his constituents dancing in the streets. Please remember that American    Jews share your moral outrage at international terrorism as well as your    determination to defend democratic ideals and religious freedom in the world.    As diversified as we are in our political views, we are united in our hope    that you, the leader in the campaign against the world-wide terror, will    recognize that terror is Israel is but another of its facets, another result    of the hatred being systematically taught to Arab children by the Palestinian    Authority and state-funded schools elsewhere in the Muslim world. Years    ago, we had hopes that we were entering a new era, an era of peace that    would see Palestinians living alongside Israelis, in an alliance that would    make the entire area flourish. If the Palestinian leadership can be persuaded    to stop the abomination of terrorist attacks on innocent civilians, it may    still not be too late.&quot;       Think about that letter when we get to cluster four and analyse WILD THORNS    and MARTYR'S CROSSING.    For the close textual analysis assignment, copy out two passages from each    of the books that seem the most moving to you. Then write down your memoir    from 9/11. Then look at the relationship of the memoir to the event, to    what the personal story gives you that you cannot get in a history book    or traditional novel. How does the memoir get closer to reality and give    the novel depth and breadth? How does the novel based on memoir allow the    personal story to be catharsized completely? How does your memoir give dimension    to mainstream news coverage of 9/11?       Cluster Three: Inspired by my trip to    the middle east and love of Egyptian culture, (another Western orientalist?    not exactly!) I chose the next three books to analyze cross-cultural story    expectations, Islamic feminism and the recursive, poetic aesthetics of Arabic    story-telling, as well as the different time/space elements. In GOD DIES    BY THE NILE the sexual abuse of young girls, the clitorectomies, the    stoning of the adulteress, many of the injustices present in contemporary    Islam are ruthlessly described by Nawal el Saadawi, the first female Egyptian    doctor whose writing was so controversial she was imprisoned by Sadat. THE    DAY THE LEADER WAS KILLED is a collection of monologues by three characters    about their domestic/love problems around the time Sadat was assassinated,    but again, the focus is on the injustice of the arranged marriage that Randa    must submit to for social approval and financial necessity, in spite of    her love for Elwan, and the grandfather's wisdom, pain and ultimate impotence.    Sadat's murder is wedged in between Elwan's beating of his rival to death,    which seems almost like a unconscious eruption of rage and jealousy. For    more ideas about cross-cultural feminism, go to twenty/bodyf.html.    Neither book has the linear kinesthetic thrust of the traditional western    crisis/climax/resolution. In GOD DIES there are so many crises/climaxes    that Zakeya's murder of the village leader seems only one of many. When    asked where Allah is, she says, in prison, that she killed him-- he is buried    on the banks of the Nile. El Saadawi's structure is Arabic in its recursive    themes of sun rising and setting on every scene, but also multi-orgasmic    with its many climaxes. Mahfo uz weaves his climax into the fabric    of Egyptian domestic life, never giving in to its finality, always letting    each character finish the integrity of his monologue, asserting his    own microcosmic reality. WAR IN THE LAND OF EGYPT is also written    with very different story expectations than typical Hollywood fare. None    of these books have really happy endings, unless one could say that ending    up in prison is a happy ending.    Naguib Nahfouz is the best-known and most studied Arab novelist in the    Anglophone world. Mafouz was born in a warren of ancient alleys in the heart    of Islamic Cairo, behind the al-Hussein Mosque, in the neighborhood of Gamaliya,    in December 1911. His father, a minor civil cervant, was highly traditional,    and his mother was doting, his childhood lonely but unremarkable. After    attending Islamic elementary schools and a secular high school, he entered    Cairo University (then King Faud 1) University and in 1934 graduated with    a degree in philosophy. He rememberes that period, which coincided with    the anticolonial movement against the British, as the happiest of his life--as    &quot;the golden age of patriotism....when the times themselves were listening    to you,&quot; he wrote in his 1961 novel The Thief and the Dogs .    Until 1971, all his works were written late at night, for he spent his    days as a government bureaucrat: as an official film censor, an adviser    on the arts, and a minor functionary in various ministries, including the    Ministry of Religious Affairs. A private, timid man who married late in    life, Mahfouz is a strong believer, a bit of a mystic, and a Fabian socialist    of the most passionate sort. Mahfouz married a Christian woman at age 43    and had two daughters and no grandchildren. He has never liked to travel,    leaving Egypt some three times in his life. By the late 1950s, social realism    had become the defining characteristic of his work. His well-ordered, punctilious,    conservative daily life was the antithesis of the world he created in his    books. Note what he says in this book we are studying: &quot;We live in    a repugnant age of slogans. And between the slogans and the truth is an    abyss, into which we have all fallen and lost ourselves.&quot;    He published his first novel in 1939 and since then has written thirty-two    novels and thirteen collections of short stories. This prolific writer's    work appears to have gone through four stages. The first (1939-44) consisted    of three novels based on the history of ancient Egypt, focusing on a cherished    theme, the heroic struggle of the Egyptians and their patriotic Pharaohs    to expel the Hysos, as foreign ruling invaders, from their country. Like    Camus' THE PLAGUE, THE STRUGGLE OF THEBES bore a relevance to Egyptian sociopolitcal    reality, the British occupation. In 1945, Mahfouz left the history of Phaoronic    Egypt to write A NEW CAIRO. This led to the publication of THE CAIRO    TRILOGY, in 1956-57, a realistic study of Egyptian urban society between    the two World Wars. In THE MIRAGE, published in 1948, Mahfouz experimented    with a psychoanalytic novel, inspired by Freud. In 1959 another stage began    with OUR QUARTER, an allegory of human history. In the mid seventies    he returned to the fourth stage where he asserts the unique voice of Arabic    narrative forms in THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS and THE DAY THE    LEADER WAS KILLED .    Mahfouz' world view is similar to Sartre's social commitment and responsibility,    a far cry from the nihilism of Islamic extremists. His work reveals the    irony of a European intellectual woven through the ancient Arabic storytelling.    In 1988 the Swedish Academy gave him the Nobel Prize and wrote that \"through    works rich in nuance-- now clearsightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous,    Mahfouz has formed an Arabic narrative art that applies to all mankind.\"    His characters are warm and human, in spite of and because of their grotesque    flaws from the tyrannical merchant of the Cairo Trilogy, to his debauched    and fanatical sons, to the weak and wayward women who tempt and distract    them. Yet there is a robust sensuality, a deep reverence for Islam, a generous    tolerance and the creation of world so ripe and vivid that you want to savor    it forever. CHILDREN OF THE ALLEY with its autocratic rulers and echoes    of prophets found in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, proved most controversial    and prompted a religious fatwa calling for his death in 1989.    In 1994 there was a near-fatal assault on Mahfouz by Islamic terrorists,    wonderfully described by Mary Anne Weaver in her book, A Portrait of    Egypt (1999) when he was stabbed while sitting in his car. since then    he has only been able to write for 30 minutes at a time because of injuried    nerves. He must keep armed guards around his apartment even now, in 2002.90    year old Mahfouz was recently interviewed (2002) for the New York Times .    He says that even now he struggles to write every day: &quot;A writer must    sit down to write every day, pick up his pen and try to write something--    anything-- on a piece of paper. Perhaps they will succeed, or maybe come    up with a new idea that will blossom eventually. Perhaps they will complete    a short story, and perhaps nothing will happen at all.&quot;       Like many of the writers we are studying, Mahfouz is intensely involved    in political, social and philosophical debate. At 90 his eyes and ears are    so impaired that a friend arrives every morning to read the headlines for    an hour. He gave his first interest payments from his Nobel Prize to Palestinian    charities and now defends suicide bombers, a common position among Arab    intellectuals:    &quot;They are people defending a cause by sacrificing with their souls,    and this is the highest level of noble resistance, although the death of    civilians is regrettable. We have to remember that this is not a regular    fight, a regular war where you can choose your target and fight only soldiers.    This is a desperate situation where you blow yourself up and whoever happens    to be on the site.&quot;    At the same time he shows little patience for those who want to destroy    Israel or censor freedom of expression or intercultural exchanges between    Jews and Arabs. At the end of the interview, after discussing death, he    said:    &quot;That is the way of life. You give up your pleasures one by one until    there is nothing left, and then you know it is time to go.&quot;    Think of the elements of THE DAY THE LEADER WAS KILLED, describing the    time when Mohammad Atta lived in Egypt: the decline of the Egyptian system,    the emergence of an authoritarian state, a middle-class urban family torn    apart by economic stagnation and uncertainty, the sexual tensions of a young    couple in a society in which men and women are kept strictly apart, the    rise of corruption, and of militant Islam, as the almost inevitable result    of a system that seems to be spiraling out of control.    Elwan could be like many of the cafe drifters, unable to find a job or    buy or furnish an apartment, unable therefore, to marry Randa the woman    he loves, and forced to share that dingy, cramped room with his grandfather.    Think of what he says in that coffeehouse, a coffeehouse where Mafouz probably    did most of his writing: &quot;We are a people more acclimatized to defeat    than to victory. It is just a Mafia which controls us--no more, no less.    Where are the good old days?...My pride wounded, my heart broken, I have    come to this cafe as a refuge from the pain of loneliness....How many nations    live side by side in this one nation of ours? How many millionaires are    there? Relatives and parasites? Smugglers and pimps? Shi'ites and Sunnis?--stories    far better than A Thousand and One Nights What do eggs cost today?    This is my concern. Yet, as the same time, singers and belly dancers in    the nightclubs on Pyramid Road are showered with banknotes and gratuities.    What did the imam of the mosque say within earshot of the soldiers of the    Central Security Force? There is not one public lavatory in this entire    neighborhood...[Sada] He's a failure--&quot;my friend [Menachem]Begin, my    friend Kissinger,&quot; is all he can say; his uniform is Hitler's; his    act, the act of Charlie Chaplin. He's rented our entire country--furnished--to    the United States...&quot;    There are many Saudi extremists who feel that Saudi Arabia has been rented,    furnished, to the US as well. While Mafouz chronicles Eyptian urban life    in Cairo, el Saadawi and al Qa'id describe the corruption of the authorities,    usually the Imam, in the rural outskirts.        Nawal el Saadawi in &quot;BREEDING TERROR or AN UNCIVILISED CLASH OF CIVILIZATONS&quot;:    \"Once again we are facing the fundamentalist, absolutist dichotomy of God    versus the Devil, and of Good versus Evil used to mystify people, to confuse    them, to veil their minds. The language which George W. Bush uses is no    different from that of the pope, or that of bin Laden. All three speak in    the name of God against the enemy, against the Devil. The church and the    mosque are not just spiritual bodies with a spiritual agenda, but also geopolitical,    economic and even military bodies, but their agendas here are clothed in    spiritual robes....This war on terrorism is being used to halt the rising    wave of opposition to unbridled transnational exploitation of nature, human    resources and human life. In the global patriarchal capitalist system war    ahas been and remians the economic stimulus required to stave off recession    and protect accumulation of profits. But I wonder how many bombs will be    needed, and how many innocent people must die in order to ensure that the    Dow Jones and the Nasdaq will begin to climb once more....State terrorism    is the elder brother of individual terrorism except that it claims the legitimacy    of laws upheld by a powerful few.\"    Like American and Israeli leaders, she feels that fear is the great enemy,    not because we can't shop till we drop, but because it will make us accept    anything in the name of security or the war against terrorism. \"Fear can    help the Big Brother to drive us with a big stick into an Orwellian world.\"    El Saadawi believes we should eradicate the original roots of all kinds    of terrorism by restoring religion to the personal realm and developing    secular huimanist societies that are able to abolish colonial and neo-colonial    principles as well as the hegemony of the multinational corporations of    the World Economic Forum. She speaks at the World Social Forum, advocating    peace, love and justice from the grassroots up, abolishing all patriarchal    systems that breed double standards and binary thinking. What do YOU think?       El Saadawi was born into a well educated family in 1931 in the village    of Kafr Tahal, Egypt. Along with Shakespeare, Aristotle, Sartre, DeLillo,    Lightman, she is one of my heros because of the energy, curiosity, intelligence    and strength which with she has embraced and attacked so many areas of human    knowledge and discourse: medicine, literature, politics, religion. She even    has a great website. www.nawalsaadawi.net. After her imposed clitorectomy,    she has been a strong advocate for feminist rights, criticizing the sexism    of the American cosmetics industry as well as Islamic fundamentalism. In    1955 she became Egypt's Director of Public Health, but her book WOMEN    AND SEX (1972), condemning clitorectomies and the veiling of the female    mind even more than her body, aroused the anger of male authorities who    put her in prison because of her continued research and writings in this    area. After his assassination in l981 (read Mahfouz) she was freed and continued    her political, medical and literary fight for the rights of oppressed peoples,    particularly women. She claims that Westerners are particularly oppressed    by their governments because they believe they are free even though they    are the greatest true believers of them all and their democracy an illusion    of freedom and equal rights.    In spite of her didacticism, her writing can be beautifully simple and    poetic with ancient themes like the rising and setting of the sun in GOD    DIES BY THE NILE . While DeLillo begins writing by deconstructing the    sentence, by falling in love with words, she distrusts words, because they    are weapons manipulated by Machiavellian politicians:\"Language should be    clear, so we understand each other. No monopoly, no playing, no games, no    political games, no linguistic games, because I am really fed up with the    linguistic games of the so-called 'postmodern era.'...We find ourselves    lost in an avalanche of words which appear very dissident, and which multiplya    dn reproduce themselves endlessly....We drown in these words; we are suffocated    by them. It is the zero-sum game of words in which you lose your power to    understand.\" For el Saadawi, language is a weapon, at least to those who    imprisoned her, a weapon she will not give up even if it means her body    would be imprisoned again. Like many great writers of our times, writing    is her jihad, and as founder and president of the Arab Women Solidarity    Association, her strong stance offers a welcome antidote to many solution    to the clash of civilisations.    Like many of the books in this syllabus, WAR IN THE LAND OF EGYPT was banned    in its country of origin in the seventies. Unlike much of the Arabic literature,    this story is steeped in irony and black humor as it recounts the fiasco    that occurs when a village elder persuades a poor night-watchman to send    his own son as a stand-in for the elder's son who was drafted into the Egyptian    army on the eve of the 1973 October war. Like Mahfouz, Yusuf al-Qa'id makes    use of multiple narrators, but Qa'id's characters do not each present the    entirety of the plot; in fact, there is eventually no overlap in their narrations,    and therefore little or not repetition of events. This permits the plot    to unfold as it would in a standard narrative, devoid of multiple voices,    which enhances the story's dramatic impact while maintaining the variety    of perspectives and giving us a microcosmi catalogue of Egyptian social    types. The characters are conscious of their roles, as well as their co-narrators,    which leads to more conflict between the characters. The story is embedded    in Qa'id's sociology where schisms between rich and poor, city and country,    mystery and myth deepen the conflicts between characters. After all my years    of reading and writing, al-Qa'id has given me a more pristine understanding    of narrative.    Born in 1944, Yusuf Qa'id is one of the most important representatives    of the new generation in style and sociological message, even though (or    maybe because) he was born in a small village from a long line of poor,    illiterate peasants, and received all his education in his native land.    His trilogy, THE COMPLAINTS OF THE ELOQUENT EGYPTIAN, involves an author    writing a novel, drafts of which are incorporated into the text, along with    other documents. Another of his novels, IT IS HAPPENING IN EGYPT NOW foreshadows    interactive hyperfiction as it invites the reader to create the novel along    with the author, providing documents for that purpose.    Choose short passages from each of the three books that illustrate the    unique features of Arabic story telling, the recursive themes and structure,    multiple and/or mysterious or flattened climaxes, multiple narrators. Sometimes    I like to compare Western ballet to Middle Eastern dance to help students    understand the difference between the gravity-defying, competitive discipline    of pointe work with the earthbound, undulating, repetitive sensuousness    of belly dancing. Or compare the round, voluptuous spaciousness of Mosque    architecture to the jagged, stuffed, ambitious and upward bound soaring    of a skyscraper. See if you can find the same similarities in the literature.    In spite of her didacticism, El Saadawi's writing can be beautifully simple    and poetic with ancient themes like the rising and setting of the sun in    GOD DIES BY THE NILE. While DeLillo begins writing by deconstructing the    sentence, by falling in love with words, she distrusts words, because they    are weapons manipulated by Machiavellian politicians:\"Language should be    clear, so we understand each other. No monopoly, no playing, no games, no    political games, no linguistic games, because I am really fed up with the    linguistic games of the so-called 'postmodern era.'...We find ourselves    lost in an avalanche of words which appear very dissident, and which multiplya    dn reproduce themselves endlessly....We drown in these words; we are suffocated    by them. It is the zero-sum game of words in which you lose your power to    understand.\" For el Saadawi, language is a weapon, at least to those who    imprisoned her, a weapon she will not give up even if it means her body    would be imprisoned again. Like many great writers of our times, writing    is her jihad, and as founder and president of the Arab Women Solidarity    Association, her strong stance offers a welcome antidote to many solution    to the clash of civilisations.    Note how the climaxes of WAR IN THE LAND OF EGYPT and THE DAY THE LEADER    WAS KILLED seem like seeds embedded in a labyrinth and the narrative objective    is to unravel the story within the community. GOD DIES BY THE NILE is multi-climactic,    with horrendous evenets occurring in almost every chapter, in a way that    leaves the reader exhausted or breathless. But the structure almost comes    from the placement of the sun in each of these events and the interface    of the Ordinary World of the village with the Special World of the wilderness    of Om Saber, Metwalli the necrophiliac, the runaway women and men and the    sites of death orgies. How different these structures are from the typical    Hollywood movie, which is essentially a cliffhanger!    When I was in Egypt, I got the worst sunburn of my life, so I am particularly    aware of the influence of the sun on the writings. In the desert, sunrise    and sunset are the big events, the only changes in that eternal landscape.    For your close textual analysis, pay particular attention to the relationship    of geography to spirituality, dreams, symbols, and the role of women in    this fiercely patriarchal world. Arabic languages are written from right    to left; metaphors, similes, long arrays of adjectives and repetition of    words are frequently used by Arabs in communicating all ideas, witness the    political rhetoric of Osama bin Laden. Again, there are some wonderful characters    to play in these books as well as great places to take your character. Don't    forget your alter ego can change the story, fall in love with the oppressed    women, take people out of jail, or change the plot any way you so desire.    Have fun!       Cluster Four: MARTYR'S CROSSING, WILD THORNS and SATANIC VERSES    were chosen to bring light to the middle eastern conflicts and    to help us understand role criticism, an outgrowth of theories of multiple    selves, developed by Foucault, Derrida, Kristeva, Sherry Turkel and other    thinkers in the second half of the twentieth century. Do a novelists' characters    reflect their thoughts? Which role are YOU playing now? Do we have one integrated    self, or are we made up of a kaleidoscope of selves? Are you starting to    integrate your alter ego in your own life? Is he helping you or wrecking    havoc?    Salman Rushdie still cannot fly Air Canada because the airline is afraid    some Islamic extremist will bring down the plane in an effort to fulfill    the fatwa issued by Iran after publication of SATANIC VERSES. Yet this is    a book of fiction. Islamic rebuttal to Western condemnation of Fatwa against    SATANIC VERSES : Semseddin Turk , the President of the MIT Islamic    Society writes \"Because of the unequivocal attempt at associating itself    with real events, THE SATANIC VERSES is dangerously, even criminally,    misleading for a Western audience that knows little about Islam and Muslims.    Rushdie's metaphors and symbols are strongly reminiscent of and reinforce    traditional Western prejudices and myths about Islam. THE SATANIC VERSES    is one of the most slanted works in a regular cycle of intentional or unintentional    misrepresentations of Islam and Muslims in media sources and textbooks.    Because of its wild implications and virulent language, the novel constitutes    an unprecedented assault on Islam, and indirectly, on the Abrahamic religions    preceding it.\"    The novel aptly begins with Saladin Chamcha and Gibreel Farishta falling    from an expoding airplane, hijacked by Shiite terrorists, to the shores    of Britain. Chamcha is an anglicized Indian who has lived in England since    youth, while Gibreel, a religious movie star, recently recovered from an    illness where he lost faith in Islam, comes to England to pursue Alleluia    Cone who he fell in love with in India. Upon arrival, Saladin grows horns    and hooves and thick hair develops all over his body, while Gibreel acquires    a halo, metamorphosing into forces of good and evil which Rushdie then blurs    by making Saladin embrace his Indian heritage while Gibreel begins to doubt    his pro-Western choices. At the end Saladin is bettered by his transformation    while Gibreel, who was the \"angel,\" commits suicide to escape from his dilemmas.    What Muslims most object to are the dreams of Gibreel, the story of Jahilia    and Mahound, the latter referring to the prophet Mohammed and the former    referring to the city of \"ignorance,\" or Mecca. He then refers to the great    personalities of Islam as \"fucking clowns,\" \"riff-raff,\" and \"goons.\" The    verses of the Koran are \"revelations of convenience.\" They particularly    hate his discussion of sex where \"sodomy and the missionary position were    apporved by the archangel, whereas the forbidden positions included all    those in which the female was on top.\" Mahound is guilty of \"fucking as    many women as he liked,\" including mothers and daughters.    Westerners rebut that Muslims are being too literal and unimaginative,    confusing postmodern, deconstructionist fictional techniques, irony, and    suspension of disbelief with deliberately malicious anti-Islamic propaganda,    thereby repressing freedom of speech. Muslims protest against the use of    obscene, violent language when dealing with respected Muslim religious leaders.    Nikos Kazantzakis also received similar criticism, without eternal death    threats, for THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST.    In an open letter to Rajiv Ghandhi, Rushdie states: \"The section of the    book in question (and let's remember the book isn't actually about Islam,    but about migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death, London    and Bombay) deals with a prophet who is snot called Muhammed living in a    highly fantastical city...in which he is surrounded by fictional followers,    one of whom happens to bear my own first name. Moreover, this entire sequence    happens in a dream, the fictional dream of a fictional character, an Indian    movie star, and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from    history could one get?    Rushdie was born to liberal, prosperous Muslim parents in Bombay June    19, 1947. In August 14 of that year, Pakistan divided itself from India    as part of an agreement ending the period of British colonialism in South    Asia. The result was a chaotic and extremely violent period as 6 million    Muslims moved north to the newly-established Islamic state and 8 million    Hindus and Sikhs moved south fleeing it. In 1961 he moved to England to    study at Rugby School and then Kings College, Cambridge. In 1980 he published    MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN which won the Booker Prize but gained a law suit from    Indira Gandhi who won her libel case before she was assassinated. In 1983    he published SHAME and in 1988 SATANIC VERSES. Like India, SATANIC VERSES    is dense, multicultural, creative, rich, magical, chaotic, a complex \"chutneyfication\"    of echoes and allusions that Rushdie infuses with biting satire. Like Wittgenstein,    Rushdie seeks to attack questions ather than provide pat answers and paradigms,    to break down the rigid, self-righteous orthodoxy of extemist Islam.    The theme is a search for identity in a post-colonial, pre-colonial vein.    People of Anglo-saxon stock are almost entirely absent form the London of    THE SATANIC VERSES. Instead the city swarms with immigrants: Indians, Bengalis,    Pakistanis, Jamaicans, German Jews, etc. He reminds the English that they    too were colonized, by the Romans and the Normans. Interestingly, he rejects    both martyrdom and triumphant nationalism as inadequate foundations for    a satisfactory self-identity, questioning the credibility and beneficence    of orthodox, traditional Islam. Gibreel's dreams challenge the Koran's claims    to infallibility, accuse Islam of the repression of women, call into question    the probity and honesty of the Prophet himself. He spares no institution    or person in his quest to answer the question, what kind of idea are we?    Underneath its complex structure Rushdie reaffirms beliefs in individual    liberty and tolerance, freedom of expression, skepticism about dogma, and    belief in the redemptive power of love. Again Rushdie voices some of the    issues developed by Sartre in his affirmation of human freedom and responsibility    in a world devoid of absolutes. Rusdie writes about the novel in his essay,    \"Is Nothing Sacred?\" \"Because whereas religion seeks to privileg one language    above all others, the novel has always been about the way in which different    languages, values and narratives quarrel, and about the shifting relations    between them, which are relations of power. The novel does not seek to establish    a privileged language, but it insists upon the freedom to portray and analyze    the struggle between the different contestants for such privileges. (420)    ...while the novel anaswers our need for wonderment and understanding, it    brings us harsh and unpalatable news as well. It tells us there are no rules.    It hands down no commandments....And it tells us there are no answers; or    rather, it tells us that answers are easier to come by, and less reliable,    than questions. If religion is an answer, if political ideology is an answer,    then literature is an inquiry; great literature, by asking extraordinary    questions, opens new doors in our minds. (423) \"In the twentieth century,    the novel came to be viewed as primarily oppositional, critical of the culture    which produced it. Rather than providing values, it challenges them. Modern    novels are praised for their courage in exposing hypocrisy, challenging    tradition, exploring forbidden themes. If blasphemy is not the most common    of techniques in western fiction it is because so few writers take religion    seriously enough to feel it worth attacking. \"(Rushdie:\"In God We Trust\"376-377)       In 1988 VikingPenguin published SATANIC VERSES at which point a Saudi newspaper    in London denounced him. Threats and complaints followed and in 1989 the    book was burned before TV cameras in England, 5 members of an extremist    group attacked the American Culture Center in Islamabad, and in Kashmir,    sixty were injured and one died in a protest. For these questions and his    plIn an age of terror, how does literature help us transcend our reality, lend perspective to our confusion by pulling us into the past and other cultures, and give expression to our anguish and fear through catharsis? They survived it; so can we. In this course we will define terrorism the way the Arabs define it, as any organized violence, by an individual, group or state, legitimate or illegitimate, against a civilian population, either intentional or unintentional. Because this is about twentieth and twenty first century literature, we will include the two World Wars with All Quiet on the Western Front, Night, No Exit, The Plague about Algerian terror as well as the German occupation and natural scourges, to Islamic militant terrorism in Egypt in The Day The Leader Was Killed, Satanic Verses, God Dies by the Nile and War in the Land of Egypt, to Israeli/Palestinian terror in Martyr's Crossing and Wild Thorns, to the terror of hostage-taking and kidnapping in Mao II, News of a Kidnapping, and The Hostage, to the terror of totalitarian regimes such as China in Red Azalea and Soul Mountain. Black Water is both a personal and stylistic meditation on terror as well as an indirect indictment of the terror a powerful political leader has over an innocent civilian. Because one objective of fiction/drama is to create a combustive drama for the reader's catharsis, literature and terrorism are really competing with each other. Sometimes real life provides so much terror that the reader hides in literature for escape, seeking fantasy, happy endings, funny, harmless stories that eschew the turmoil of an unlivable situation. Often cultures will move through a transformation like New York did after 9/11, moving from the transformation of reality into tragedy with heroic stories, to silly, innocuous escapes, to some social comedy, and finally to stories that deal with fictional terror. No one can take too much of one thing. When New Yorkers were coughing from the smoke and toxins downtown, they did not go to the movies to see sci fi representations of Manhattan blowing up. Enough is enough. ayful satire, Rushdie was condemned to death by the Ayotollah Khomeini    of Iran in the following fatwa: \"I inform all zealous Muslims of the world    that the author of the book entitled SATANTIC VERSES--which has been compiled,    printed and published in opposition to Islam, the Prophet, and the Koran--and    all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are    sentenced to death.\"    He elaborates: \"I call on zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever    they may be found, so that no one else will dare to insult the Muslim sanctities.    God Willing, whoever is killed on this path is a martyr.\" Rushdie defended    himself as follows: \"Nowadays...a powerful tribe of clerics has taken over    Islam. These are the contemporary Thought Police. They have turned Muhammad    into a perfect being, his life into a perfect life, his revelation into    the unambiguous, clear event it originally was not. Powerful taboos have    been erected. One may not discuss Muhammad as if he were human, with human    virtues and weaknesses. One may not discuss the growth of Islam as a historical    phenomenon, as an ideology born out of its time. These are the taboos against    which THE SATANIC VERSES has transgressed (these and one other: I also tried    to write about the place of women in Islamic society, and in the Koran).    It is for the breach of taboo that the novel is being anathematized, ...THE    SATANIC VERSES is not, in my view, an antireligious novel. It is, however,    an attempt to write about migration, its stresses and transformations, from    the point of view of migrants from the Indian subcontinent to Britain. This    is, for me, the saddest irony of all; that after working for five years    to give voice and fictional flesh to the immigrant culture of which I am    myself a member, I should see my book burned, largely unread, by the people    it's about, people who might find some pleasure and much recognition in    its pages. I tried to write against stereotypes; the zealot protests serve    to confirm, in the Western mind, all the worst stereotypes of the Muslim    world.\" (The Book Burning 25) Even though his book was fiction, Rushdie    was personally blamed for its ideas. The extremists lack humor and suspension    of disbelief as well as tolerance. But the book itself as well as the political    controversy are good examples of the dilemmas of role criticism, which we    will examine in the American Jewish and Palestinian interpretations of occupations    and Israeli checkpoints.The story of the Satanic Verses is not mentioned    either in the Koran or in any of the early oral or written sources. As a    magical realist, Rushdie chooses to focus all his attention on these figments,    instead of writing a more accurate, comprehensive version of Islam. But    he is a novelist, not a scholar.    One of my students was recently reprimanded in the New York subway in July    2002 for reading SATANIC VERSES. Accosted by a Muslim woman, she was told    &quot;not to believe anything in that book.&quot; Is that the point of novels,    to make us believe, or is suspension of disbelief just the willingness to    enter a FANTASY world created by the author? Why do so many cultures, American    included, expect fiction to be naturalistic, true to life? Why do some of    us take irony, humor, satire, fantasy so literally?    Ever since I spent the night in a Greek freighter in the harbor of Alexandria,    listening to Egyptians throwing grenades into the sea in the hopes of bursting    the eardrums of Israeli frogmen who were planting bombs in their ships,    I have been unable to take sides in the middle eastern conflicts. I see    humans on both sides; rights and wrongs committed by all states. In MARTYR'S    CROSSING and WILD THORNS we will explore the humanity on all sides, the    longing, frustration, guilt, despair and rage that has caused the holy land    to be so unholy for so many years.    Sahar Khalifeh was born in 1941 during the British mandate in Palestine    in Nablus. She left a frustrating marriage to study literature and feminism    in America. Her first novel was confiscated by the Israelis, which shows    that militant Iran is not the only country guilty of censorship. Her second    novel was first published in Cairo. She has taught at Iowa and Bir Zeit    University and probably knew some of the suicide bombers, maybe even the    women. She founded the Women's Affairs Center in Nablus. In WILD THORNS    we see militancy as a necessary venue of resistance to Israeli occupation.    But Khalifeh does not let didacticism make her prose laborious and heavy;    the novel is rich and succulent like ripe olives and we see, hear and feel    the characters-- the underground, militant high schoolers we have recently    seen so often in the news, the shopkeeper who sells groceries to Israeli    soldiers, or the village mothers who ululate in solidarity as their homes    are bulldozed. Although it was written in 1975, the novel offers us a deeper    understanding of what is going on in 2002 with the seige of the Church of    Nativity, the bulldozing of homes in Jenin, and the terrors of the suicide/homicide    bombers/martyrs.    Khalifeh's characters are not drawn with the same good vs evil morality    we saw in GOD DIES BY THE NILE. After Usama assasinates the Israeli officer,    &quot;sombre images fill Adil's mind. The dead officer, his grieving widow,    the little girl stretched out on the ground, her pale, bare legs partly    covered by Um Sabir's veil. People running through the streets, someone    yelling, 'Leave a pig alone!' Bitterness flooded his heat. My cousin kills    a man and I carry off his daughter. Tragedy or farce? Still, the memory    of the Israeli woman's head on his shoulder, despite all the boundaries    that divided people, seemed top opne the horizons of this narrow world.&quot;    (172)    Those who compromise, however, are usually the ones to survive, so Adil    must suffer to see his family home blown up by the Israelis: &quot;Take    a deep breath, Adil told himself. Tears. Dust. Fog. He could smell lemonwood    through the acrid aroma of dust and crumbling stone. The lemon tree was    burning in the rubble of the courtyard. The soldiers looked so arrogant    in their dark cars. A thirst for reenge, for rebellion, stirred deep within    him. I'm not cruel, but I'm filled with rage and bitterness, filled up to    here. And these cowering crowds. And you yourself, Adil, a god of patience,    that's what they say. What could be worse than admitting you're an impotent    god, unable to assert your own rights or anyone else's? The process of ascent    and fall goes on. A god-like ascent to the heights of Mount AIbal. And descent    through seaweed into the gutters and decaying refuse. You search for yourself    in other people's eyes, Adil. You find yourself mirrored in the eyes of    the hungry, the nake, the homeless, those who live in tents. The winds and    storms toss you in all directions. But the will to live still beats within    you, defiant and instinctive. What can you do? Your spirit is bottled up;    it can't find a way out. You experience sorrow, repress your emotions, and    wait. Nevertheless! This mind of yours at least keeps you awake, wards off    the drunkenness of indifference. Your heart rages and storms, yet the energy's    suppressed by the machinery of oppression.&quot; (206)    But unlike the suicide bombers, Adil only thinks the thoughts and then    goes back to his job working for the Israelis: &quot;If only you were more    cruel or harder of heart, you'd blow up everything you could lay hands on,    from the Atlantic to the Gulf and on to the world's furthest reaches. You'd    leave no two stones standing. You'd uproot the trees, exposing the infections    beneath the earth's surface to the light of the sun, to the breezes of spring.    You'd turn everything upside-down. And begin again. Slowly, very slowly.    Here a seedling. There a tree. Here a flower. And you, young Sabir, a tall,    broad-shouldered palm. Your hands would bring rocks from the depths of the    earth and from the mountains. Those stones would shine like raw diamonds.    We could colour them, decorate them, and build them into rows of beautiful    houses that would stretch as far as the eye could see and stand for all    eternity. The soldiers' metal detectors could ring all they liked, we wouldn't    hear them.&quot; (207)    These are the thoughts Adil has as his enormous, ancient family house lays    in ruins, the house that Khalifeh first described as &quot;...a real, old-style    mansion. There were marble pillars, high valuted ceilings and an open courtyard    paved with huge stones. In the middle of the courtyard was a pool, surrounded    by lemon trees and sweet-smelling jasmine. Arabesque plasterwork decorated    the walls, stained glass lanterns reflected the light and the anitque chests    in every room were inlaid with mother-of-pearl.&quot; (33)    As his world crumbles, Adil meditates on the poetry of nuclear terrorism--    to destroy all and begin again. Yet for Adil, he sees it only as a wish-fulfillment,    a dream upon which he would never act. The novel closes as people go about    their business, selling newspapers and other goods, buying vegetables, fruit    and bread, surrendering to the same sad survival that Wiesel's holocaust    victims did. Does Khalifeh give you insights into the souls of these men,    that you don't see in the other two novels?    MARTYR'S CROSSING is Amy Wilentz' first novel. She is a journalist, a chronicler    of Haitian life and politics and an essayist for The New Yorker. She    said in an interview with Kate Manning that the key to writing a novel is    to create at least one character whom everyone will love, so that when he    is not there, you want him back. Now that she has finished the novel, she    feels lost without Doron, George, Marina and Ahmed. She says that she likes    Ahmed the best because he is self-centered, self-important, and based loosely    on a former PLO fighter and Bethlehem politician, who lived in a tent on    a mountain until he was forced to move into an Israeli settlement. Wilentz    said that Marina was the most difficult character to write because she is    the closest to herself. Even though she is a journalist, she tried to put    the politics around the characters' situations so that we never lose our    emotional grip on the story. She says that Doron is not crazy when he dresses    up in Palestinian clothes to search for Marina in Ramallah; it is because    he sees the other side as human that he succumbs to his suicidal situation    at the end. Many of the scenes between George and Marina were similar to    those between Amy and her father. When asked about gender and fiction, Wilentz    said: &quot;MARTYR'S CROSSING is very much a guy's novel. It's full of history    and politics and explosions and what, I'm told, is a rather ripping plot,    amazingly enough, since plot is something I hate thinking about.&quot; (Appendix)    In this cluster we are focusing on character. Note how Wilentz goes against    type and makes Ari Doron, the Israeli border guard, an almost psychotic,    but highly empathic, sensitive, wandering Jew-- wandering into enemy territory    in his Palestinian disguise to get himself killed. See how puny, skinny    and almost wimpy the jailed Hamas leader Hajimi Hassan is. Only Ahmed Amr,    and Yizhar, the Israeli boss, and George Raad, the American/Palestinian    writer/intellectual seem truer to type. When does stereotype work and when    does it become shallow? Can going against type create unbelievable characters    or just reflections of the author? In her effort to go against type has    Wilentz just created mirrors of herself? Does her over-the-shoulder third    person narrator who speaks in the same staccato, verbless sentences for    everyone help or hurt the interior monologues of characterisation? Does    the precipitous inciting incident give you enough time to develop empathy    for Ibrahim, the asthmatic baby? What techniques does she use to enhance    suspense in the thriller structure? Notice the clarity of the central dramatic    question: \"Will Hamas find The Soldier indirectly responsible for Ibrahim's    death?\" and the way Wilentz relentlessly focuses on this question from every    perspective. Wilentz' transparent, communicative style prunes descriptive,    interior monologue, dialogue and diversion to create the forward momentum    of her American style narrative, unlike Rushdie's more coded novel that    requires research into Indian culture, the Koran, immigrant London and his    fertile imagination in order to understand all the allusions. Wilentz is    a perceptive writer, an accomplished journalist who seems to understand    Israel better than Palestine. Based on my trip to Israel in the seventies,    I was particularly impressed with her economical, but brilliant description:    &quot;Doron hated the desert wind: it coated cars with a film of yellow    sand, it go up your nose, it made you cough, and worst of all, it reminded    you that Jerusalem, with its McDonald's and Burger Kings and nice red buses    and nice red post offices and its green gardens and flowering terraces and    public buildings flanked by foundatins, was actually right on the edge of    an ancient desert where camels and cactuses and Bedouins were the only successful    species. &quot; (109)    Contrast the difference in the traditional American suspense structure    of MARTYRS CROSSING with the Arabic narrative of WILD THORNS and the wildly    nonlinear, deconstructionist narrative of SATANIC VERSES, which nevertheless,    has a beginning, middle and end. Note the preponderance of dialogue again    in the Arabic novel, the use of compound words in SATANIC VERSES to accentuate    the &quot;chutneyfication&quot; of language, and the clean, New York nineties    style of MARTYR's CROSSING. See how Rushdie and Wilentz play with good and    evil, while Khalifeh sticks to her political agenda and didacticism, albeit    embedding it in a rich poetic language and imagery.    To clarify the sociopolitical context of this cluster, read the following    speech given by President Bush on June 24, 2002:    &quot;For the sake of all humanity, things must    change in the Middle East. It is untenable for Israeli citizens to live    in terror. It is untenable for Palestinians to live in squalor and occupation.    And the current situation offers no prospect that life will improve. Israeli    citizens will continue to be victimized by terrorists and so Israel will    continue to defend herself. And the situation of the Palestinian people    will grow more and more miserable. My vision is two states living side by    side in peace and security. There is simply no way to achieve that peace    until all parties fight terror. Yet at this critical moment, if all parties    will break with the past and set out on a new path, we can overcome the    darkness with the light of hope. Peace requires a new and different Palestinian    leadership so that a Palestinian state can be born. I call on the Palestinian    people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I call upon    them to build a practicing democracy based on tolerance and liberty. If    the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world    will actively support their efforts. If the Palestinian people meet these    goals, they will be able to reach agreement with Israel and Egypt and Jordan    on security and other arrangements for independence. And when the Palestinian    people have new leaders, new institutions and new security arrangements    with their neighbors, the United States of America will support the creation    of a Palestinian state, whose borders and certain aspects of its sovereignty    will be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the    Middle East. In the work ahead, we all have responsibilities. The Palestinian    people are gifted and capable. And I'm confident they can achieve a new    birth for their nation. A Palestinian state will never be created by terror.    It will be built through reform. And reform must be more than cosmetic change    or veiled attempt to preserve the status quo. True reform will require entirely    new political and economic institutions based on democracy, market economics    and action against terrorism.    Today the elected Palestinian legislature has    no authority. And power is concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable    few. A Palestinian state can only serve its citizens with a new constitution    which separates the powers of government. The Palestinian parliament should    have the full authority of a legislative body. Local officials and government    ministers need authority of their own and the independence to govern effectively.    The United States, along with the European Union and Arab states, will work    with Palestinian leaders to create a new constitutional framework and a    working democracy for the Palestinian people. And the United States, along    with others in the international community, will help the Palestinians organize    and monitor fair multiparty local elections by the end of the year, with    national elections to follow. Today the Palestinian people live in economic    stagnation made worse by official corruption. A Palestinian state will require    a vibrant economy where honest enterprise is encouraged by honest government.    The United States, the international donor community and the World Bank    stand ready to work with Palestinians on a major project of economic reform    and development. The United States, the E.U., the World Bank and International    Monetary Fund are willing to oversee reforms in Palestinian finances, encouraging    transparency and independent auditing. And the United States, along with    our partners in the developed world, will increase our humanitarian assistance    to relieve Palestinian suffering. Today the Palestinian people lack effective    courts of law and have no means to defend and vindicate their rights. A    Palestinian state will require a system of reliable justice to punish those    who prey on the innocent. The United States and members of the international    community stand ready to work with Palestinian leaders to establish, finance    and monitor a truly independent judiciary. Today Palestinian authorities    are encouraging, not opposing, terrorism. This is unacceptable. And the    United States will not support the establishment of a Palestinian state    until its leaders engage in a sustained fight against the terrorists and    dismantle their infrastructure. This will require an externally supervised    effort to rebuild and reform the Palestinian security services. This security    system must have clear lines of authority and accountability and a unified    chain of command. America is pursuing this reform along with key regional    states.    The world is prepared to help. Yet ultimately    these steps toward statehood depend on the Palestinian people and their    leaders. If they energetically take the path of reform, the rewards can    come quickly. If Palestinians embrace democracy, confront corruption and    firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation    of a provisional state of Palestine. With a dedicated effort, this state    could rise rapidly as it comes to terms with Israel, Egypt and Jordan on    practical issues such as security. The final borders, the capital and other    aspects of this state's sovereignty will be negotiated between the parties    as part of a final settlement. Arab states have offered their help in this    process, and their help is needed. I've said in the past that nations are    either with us or against us in the war on terror. To be counted on the    side of peace, nations must act. Every leader actually committed to peace    will end incitement to violence in official media and publicly denounce    homicide bombings. Every nation actually committed to peace will stop the    flow of money, equipment and recruits to terrorist groups seeking the destruction    of Israel, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah. Every nation actually    committed to peace must block the shipment of Iranian supplies to these    groups and oppose regimes that promote terror like Iraq. And Syria must    choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and    expelling terrorist organizations. Leaders who want to be included in the    peace process must show by their deeds an undivided support for peace.    And as we move toward a peaceful solution, Arab    states will be expected to build closer ties of diplomacy and commerce with    Israel, leading to full normalization of relations between Israel and the    entire Arab world. Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic    Palestine. Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity in democracy.    A stable, peaceful Palestinian state is necessary to achieve the security    that Israel longs for. So I challenge Israel to take concrete steps to support    the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. Advertisement As    we make progress toward security, Israel forces need to withdraw fully to    positions they held prior to Sept. 28, 2000. And consistent with the recommendations    of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories    must stop. The Palestinian economy must be allowed to develop. As violence    subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians    to resume work and normal life. Palestinian legislators and officials, humanitarian    and international workers must be allowed to go about the business of building    a better future. And Israel should release frozen Palestinian revenues into    honest accountable hands. I've asked Secretary Powell to work intensively    with Middle Eastern and international leaders to realize the vision of a    Palestinian state, focusing them on a comprehensive plan to support Palestinian    reform and institution building. Ultimately Israelis and Palestinians must    address the core issues that divide them if there is to be a real peace,    resolving all claims and ending the conflict between them. This means that    the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 will be ended through a settlement    negotiated between the parties based on U.N. Resolutions 242 and 338, with    Israeli withdrawal to secure and recognized borders. We must also resolve    questions concerning Jerusalem, the plight and future of Palestinian refugees    and a final peace between Israel and Lebanon and Israel and a Syria that    supports peace and fights terror.    All who are familiar with the history of the Middle    East realize that there may be setbacks in this process. Trained and determined    killers as we have seen want to stop it. Yet the Egyptian and Jordanian    peace treaties with Israel remind us that with determined and responsible    leadership, progress can come quickly. As new Palestinian institutions and    new leaders emerge, demonstrating real performance on security and reform,    I expect Israel to respond and work toward a final-status agreement. With    intensive effort by all, this agreement could be reached within three years    from now. And I and my country will actively lead toward that goal. I can    understand the deep anger and anguish of the Israeli people. You've lived    too long with fear and funerals, having to avoid markets and public transportation    and forced to put armed guards in kindergarten classrooms. The Palestinian    Authority has rejected your offered hand and trafficked with terrorists.    You have a right to a normal life. You have a right to security. And I deeply    believe that you need a reformed, responsible, Palestinian partner to achieve    that security. I can understand the deep anger and despair of the Palestinian    people. For decades you've been treated as pawns in the Middle East conflict.    Your interests have been held hostage to a comprehensive peace agreement    that never seems to come as your lives get worse year by year. You deserve    democracy and the rule of law. You deserve an open society and a thriving    economy. You deserve a life of hope for your children. An end to occupation    and a peaceful democratic Palestinian state may seem distant. But America    and our partners throughout the world stand ready to help, help you make    them possible as soon as possible.    If liberty can blossom in the rocky soil of the    West Bank and Gaza, it will inspire millions of men and women around the    globe who are equally weary of poverty and oppression, equally entitled    to the benefits of democratic government. I have a hope for the people of    Muslim countries. Your commitments to morality and learning and tolerance    led to great historical achievements. And those values are alive in the    Islamic world today. You have a rich culture and you share the aspirations    of men and women in every culture. Prosperity and freedom and dignity are    not just American hopes or Western hopes; they are universal human hopes.    And even in the violence and turmoil of the Middle East, America believes    those hopes have the power to transform lives and nations. This moment is    both an opportunity and a test for all parties in the Middle East. An opportunity    to lay the foundations for future peace. A test to show who is serious about    peace and who is not. The choice here is stark and simple. The Bible says:    I have set before you life and death, therefore choose life. The time has    arrived for everyone in this conflict to choose peace and hope and life.    Thank you very much.&quot;    Who are the heroes and martyrs of these novels? How do the relate to their    home and what would they do to defend and protect it? Which character is    the most dangerous, or the most trustworthy?    In keeping with our exploration of role criticism, choose a passage from    each of the three books that reveals character. Note the extensive use of    dialogue in WILD THORNS, creating an indigenous storystelling style in the    oral tradition. You could almost make a play of the book.Note the way the    characters are so grounded in the earth and connected to their home that    you feel as bad when that home is exploded on purpose by the Israelis as    when an innocent person is murdered. The characters' scents and sounds mingle    with the aroma of market goods, the smells of olive trees, the feel of the    dusty desert. But MARTYR'S CROSSING, written by an American, is constructed    with the disciplined, highly literate technique of a New Yorker ficiton    writer, in spite of the extensive research and cross cultural empathy. All    the main characters seem to have the introspection that the female author    has and yet each cause is championed, all are sympathetic. Rushdie's characters    are unbounded, often confusing, amalgamations of reality and fantasy, bigger    than life. Analyze how each writer brings their characters to life.How    far have YOU gone with your alter ego? Do you know their dreams, hopes,    fears, plans, unconscious wishes? Their imperfections? Have you made them    fantastical in some way?What has happened to them during their journey through    all these books? How have they transformed?       Cluster Five: For years my father and brother traded with China    when the U.S. had severed economic ties to the Chinese Communist regime    during Mao's cultural Revolution. My father would come back with librettos    of the Peking Revolutionary Operas, complaining    of the hours he had to spend politely watching them, in order to seem like    an enlightened enough capitalist to close a deal with them. Please look    at some of the    pictures of these operas. When I was studying ballet, I was particularly    drawn to these strong, feminist ballerinas who carried guns as they leapt    through the air instead of dressing up as swans to be lifted by princes    in the western tradition. In many ways, feminism was more completely realized    in China before it came to America. For this reason, I chose Anchee Min's    RED AZALEA,     a description of her time in military farm during the Cultural Revolution    as well as her professional experiences as a performer in the Revolutionary    Opera. Anchee Min was born in Shanghai and lived in China from 1957 to 1984.    During the Cultural Revolution, she was a leader of the Little Red Guards    in elementary school, then she went to a place like the Red Fire Farm, and    finally played a starring role in RED AZALEA, one of Madame Mao's movies.    In 1983 she fled to the U.S. after the death of Mao, the execution of his    wife and the ensuing political turmoil. RED AZALEA received the New Times    Notable Book of the Year award and in 1985, the Carl Sandburg Literary Award.    She lives in California with her daughter where she is a painter, musician,    photographer and novelist. While she is not one of the greatest writers    of the century, RED AZALEA is one of the best memoirs of the Cultural Revolution.    This book is a highly romanticized, Americanized memoir, but it still reveals    much about the SELF vs STATE theme of this cluster.    The objectives of this session are to deepen our understanding of Marxist    criticism, touched on at the beginning with the French existentialists,    in an analysis of the literature post Cultural Revolution in China, and    to enhance our sensitivity to purely descriptive writing, isolating it from    the English idiosyncrasies of linguistic style which we will analyse in    the final cluster. I chose SOUL MOUNTAIN not only because it won the Nobel    Prize but because it represents the matrix of the collective Chinese culture,    Gao Xingjian's forays into individualism and deconstruction with his multiple    protagonist I, she, he, you narrator, and the vast nature and history described    in the long treks through the mountains. It is a book of the future, of    the multicultural mix of the best of self with nature and the state. It    ends with questions, with inquiry, with an openness, as expansive as the    towering mountains. Gao Xingjian makes his living as a painter of ink drawings.    When comparing this work to that of Sartre, who is more confrontational,    discursive and dialectical, do you see how visual Xingjian is, painstakingly    painting one image after the other as he weaves through the mountains? Note    how the effectiveness of the descriptive language of both Xingjian and Min    comes from superior visualization rather than language use as the vocabulary    and syntax are not that remarkable. In fact, in Mabel Lee's translation,    comma splices are rampant and the word choice is fairly mundane; yet the    images created in the brain glow with power and vividness because of the    precise visualization of the authors. Min has a deeper sense of personal    drama the way she relives her relationships with Yan and her colleagues    in the Opera but Xingjian has a sense of the epic, creating a kind of Joycean    Odyssey for Chinese literature. Although Chinese culture, from Confucius    to Mao, is strongly collective, there is a hierarchy in this gigantic organization    and like America, a way for it to abandon religion for a completely secular    government, something that the Islamic world does not often want to do.    While Little Green was ostracized in her culture, a woman like Yan might    not get the love and financial rewards she wants in American culture. What    is the difference between the hypnosis of TV commercials and Red Army slogans?    Americans can theoritically turn the channel but unless one makes peace    with McWorld, financial security and comfort are denied. Chinese communism    was more binary but maybe having intellectuals spend a few months working    in a field is better than just not paying them for anything which is what    often happens in America. As you analyze some of this propaganda and censorship,    take a closer look at how we manipulate thought in the U.S.    Take your alter ego to the prison farm, up the mountains, and through    Chinese vast geography. How does geography change your character? Because    we will not be doing close textual analyses of these books, try to incorporate    form and content, style and story into your presentations and discussion.We    will also discuss the differences between China and the U.S. in terms of    the semiotics of war propaganda, nonverbal communication, and literature's    power and place in the state.While Communist regimes often outlawed or    imprisoned writers, thereby creating dissent, scandal and usually more popularity,    Capitalist countries just ignore many of their great artists, writers and    thinkers who subsequently slip into oblivion.    The micro objective of this cluster is to sensitize us to the descriptive    powers and talents of Min and Xingjian. The imagery is very specific without    being influenced by the oral, sonorous quality of adjectives and adverbs.    Xingjian is an ink and paper artist who paints every scene precisely in    all its dimensions; Min is more of a dramatic writer, intensifying objectives    and obstacles to make her life story more focused and combustive than it    probably was. Nevertheless she uses unusual metaphors and vivid description.    The Chinese language was recorded well before the Gutenberg invention established    written language in the West.Stemming from pictogram to ideogram to vertical    alignment, it stimulates different thought patterns and relationship of    image to action and thought.    While Western languages move from left to right with complex syntax, and    Semitic languages move from right to left with a heavy oral feature, Chinese    language moves up and down. Yet the architecture (Forbidden City of Beijing)    and city planning, the ballet (with the ballerinas caught in horizontal    lines of arabesques and hand-held rifles) create horizontal lines. Mosques    are circular domes while the spires of cathedrals and the modern skyscrapers    are vertical. Middle eastern dance is earthbound as the belly ripples in    circles while Western dance pitches the ballerina on her tip toes in gravity-    defying, illusory, upward bound acts.    What I love most about Chinese civilization are the martial arts, massage,    acupuncture, 5 elements, food, --in other words, the holistic connection    between humans and nature, something we see in the activities at the Red    Fire Farm in Red Azalea, as well as the journeys of the narrator through    the mountains of China. At times he seems to be uncomfortable with &quot;I,&quot;    with naked solitude, so he invents the she, he and you, not only to keep    him company but because Chinese communication begins with a duo or a triad,    never with the naked self.    The Chinese Communication Research scholar and colleague of Professor Keefer,    Jia Wenshen, writes that the &quot;Chinese live in a web of relations, but    this web is vvery insulated and walled. Beyond the web is a world the Chinese    tend to perceive to be generally hostile, harsh, and cold, and thus they    act accordingly....&quot;in the modern West, communication is primarily    concerned with effectiveness of passing objectie information separable form    the human agent as a sender to the human agent as a receiver. In other words,    Chinese communication is conceptualized as a morality-centered activity    to improve members' social behavior, whereas the Western scientific model    of communication is primarily conceptualized as a scientific instrument    to transmit knowledge to other people for the mere sake of knowledge. Communication    in this Western sense is largely detached from moral reasoning or the purpose    of bettering people's social behavior. &quot; Professor Wenshen feels that    Chinese communication research must be consistent with Chinese philosophy--cosmology,    epistemology, ontology, axiology-- and Chinese culture. He focuses on interpersonal    concepts such as face or mianzi, humanness or renquiing, and connections    or guanxi. To understand the political meetings and the history of negotiation    we must understand face. Face is important in politics and literature as    evidenced by the propaganda, posters of Mao and descriptions of face. Wenshen    divides this concept of face into relational, communal/social, hierarchical    and moral components rooted in Confucianism but he is quick to point out    that Confucianism is hierarchal and modern Chinese communication must include    changes made since the uprising in l989 in Tiananmen Square which called    for more democracy and therefore equality in all aspects of life. Professor    Wenshen is writing a book on this which will be useful for international    business students.    Besides analyzing SOUL MOUNTAIN from the stylistic (descriptive precision),    political (Marxist), and deconstructionist points of view, we should also    look at it as a shamanic journey, a more indigneous journey than what Campbell    outlines in his myth studies but with many of the same landmarks and personae    such as Guardians, Warriors etc. See    Myth and the Movies.    For a stronger focus on the cultural revolution, read Xingjian's newly    translated book, ONE MAN'S BIBLE with searing memories of repression under    Mao. Gao Xingjian really won the Nobel Prize for his two novels -- SOUL    MOUNTAIN and ONE MAN'S BIBLE, published in Taiwan in 1999 and recently translated    by Mabel Lee. While SOUL MOUNTAIN is born of the 1980s and is a more mystical,    inquisitive book, ONE MAN'S BIBLE bleeds from the claustrophobia, cruelty    and paranoia of the cultural revolution of the sixties and seventies when    neighbors and families spied on each other, creative people burned their    work and communities were scattered and decimated by re-education, prison    labor, disease and untimely death. In this book he only uses a YOU and a    HE narrator.    This life is described as follows: &quot;...you write simply to indicate    that a sort of life, worse than a quagmire, more real than an imaginary    hell, more terrifying than Judgment Day, has, in fact, existed. Furthermore,    it is very likely that when people have forgotten about it, it will make    a comeback...It is by cloaking naked reality with a gauze curtain, ordering    language and weaving into it feelings and aesthetics that you are able to    derive pleasurre from looking back at it, and are interested in continuing    to write.&quot;    It might be interesting to compare ONE MAN'S BIBLE with RED AZALEA.

In 1962, Mao advocated the Socialist Education Movement (SEM), in an attempt    to 'inoculate' the peasantry against the temptations of feudalism and the    sprouts of capitalism that he saw re-emerging in the countryside. Large    doses of didactic politicized art, whether figurative or literary, were    produced as serum for this inoculation process. The Party organization saw    the initiatives proposed by Mao and his even more radical followers as interfering    with its successful program of economic rehabilitation that had started    after the Great Leap Forward. Given the scope of the problems, the Party    preferred more technocratic solutions and was averse to Mao's millennial    visions. There are no indications that open opposition to Mao actually existed,    although the Chairman believed there was. He was truly convinced that the    more moderate leaders were trying to steal his place in history by subverting    the nature of the revolution he had fought for. In order to reclaim his    rightful place at the apex of power and to oust those he perceived as revisionists,    Mao turned towards the People's Liberation Army, the only organization he    still deemed ideologically correct. Mao already had appeared prominently    on propaganda posters dating back as far as 1950, despite his ambiguous    warnings against a personality cult. The intensity of his portrayal in the    second half of the 1960s, however, was unparalleled. Under Lin Biao, the    PLA increasingly was employed to bolster the personality cult around Mao,    and thus to produce art that would contribute to the construction of Mao's    god-like image. All this took place with Mao's consent. Already before the    compilation of the Quotations from Chairman Mao (Mao zhuxi yulu, the 'Little    Red Book', published in May 1964) for use by the armed forces, the PLA had    been turned into \"a great school of Mao Zedong Thought\". The army became    the driving force behind the campaign to study Mao's Quotations. A study    session with the Quotations \"... supplied the breath of life to soldiers    gasping in the thin air of the Tibetan plateau; enabled workers to raise    the sinking city of Shanghai three-quarters of an inch; inspired a million    people to subdue a tidal wave in 1969, inaccurate meteorologists to forecast    weather correctly, a group of housewives to re-invent shoe polish, surgeons    to sew back severed fingers and remove a ninety-nine pound tumor as big    as a football.\"    The PLA also supplied most of the behavioural models that embodied the    \"spirit of a screw\" (luosiding jingshen) by blindly following the instructions    from the Party and/or superiors and attachment to the larger group. The    best known of these were model soldiers as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Dong Cunrui,    and Ouyang Hai. Logically, the Army became responsible for art. This art    should unite and educate the people, inspire the struggle of revolutionary    people and eliminate the bourgeoisie. Art had to be guided by Mao Zedong    Thought, its contents had to be militant and to reflect real life. Proletarian    ideology, communist morale and spirit, revolutionary heroism were the messages    of a new type of hyper-realism that took precedence over style and technique    and that differed in all aspects from art creation until then. In the PLA    paintings of the time, the color red featured heavily; it symbolized everything    revolutionary, everything good and moral; the color black, on the other    hand, signified precisely the opposite. Color symbolism continued to be    important in the following years, not only in visual propaganda, but in    printed propaganda as well. Mao's wife Jiang Qing supported the artistic    direction set by the PLA. The conceptual dogmas and theatrical conventions    provided by the model operas (yangbanxi) that she supported also became    the standard in the visual arts. For the stage, she formulated the 'three    prominences' (stress positive characters; stress the heroic in them; stress    the central character of the main characters). In the arts, this was translated    as: the subjects were to be portrayed realistically, and they were always    to be in the centre of the action, flooded with light from the sun or from    hidden sources. Moreover, when we look at the propaganda posters of these    years, it always seems as if we, the spectators, are looking upward, as    if the action is indeed taking place upon a stage. The subjects were represented    hyper-realistically, as ageless, larger-than-life peasants, soldiers, workers    and educated youth in dynamic poses. Their strong and healthy bodies functioned    as metaphors for the strong and healthy productive classes the State wanted    to propagate. In line with the egalitarian character of the Maoist culture    of the body, the gender distinctions of the subjects were by and large erasedsomething    that was also attempted in real life. Men and women alike had stereotypical,    \"masculinized\" bodies; they were dressed in cadre grey, army green or worker/peasant    blue; their hands and feet often were absurdly big in relation to the rest    of their bodies; and their faces, including short-cropped hairdos and chopped-off    pigtails, were done according to a limited standard repertoire of acceptable    examples. Even in the many propaganda posters that featured Mao, the Chairman    was subjected to these stylistic dictates. As a result, he appeared as a    muscular super-person. As the Great Teacher, the Great Leader, the Great    Helmsman, the Supreme Commander, Mao came to dominate the propaganda art    of the first half of the Cultural Revolution. His image was considered more    important than the occasion for which a particular work of propaganda art    was designed: in a number of cases, identical posters dedicated to Mao were    published in different years bearing different slogans, i.e., serving different    propaganda causes. Mao could be depicted as a benevolent father, bringing    the Confucian mechanisms of popular obedience into play. Or he was portrayed    as a wise statesman, an astute military leader or a great teacher; to this    end, artists represented him in the vein of the statues of Lenin, which    had started to appear in the early 1920s. Another group of posters visually    recounted the more illustrious of his historical deeds. ...       But no matter how Mao was depicted, he had to be painted hong, guang, liang    (red, bright, and shining); no grey was allowed for shading, and the use    of black was interpreted as an indication that the artist harbored counter-revolutionary    intentions. His face was painted usually in reddish and other warm tones,    and in such a way that it appeared smooth and seemed to radiate as the primary    source of light in a composition. In many instances, Mao's head seemed to    be surrounded by a halo which emanated a divine light, illuminating the    faces of the people standing in his presence. As a super model, every detail    of his representations had to be preconceived along ideological lines and    invested with symbolic meaning. An extreme example of this is the painting-turned    poster Chairman Mao goes to Anyuan. As a consequence of these creative rules    governing the depiction of Mao, the more god-like and divorced from the    masses he became to be portrayed, often hovering above those masses. And    yet, despite this apparent distance, there was something in the Mao images    that struck a chord with the people, something recognizable that turned    him into an EveryMao. Mao somehow remained united with the people, whether    he inspected fields, shook hands with the peasants, sat down with them,    and shared a cigarette with them; whether he inspected factories or infra-structural    works, joked with the workers, and possibly shared a cigarette with them;    whether he was dressed in military uniform, discussing strategy with military    leaders, inspected the rank-and-file, or mingled with contingents of Red    Guards; whether he stood on the bow of a ship, dressed in a terry cloth    bathrobe after an invigorating swim in the Yangzi River; whether he headed    a column of representatives of the national minorities; or received a delegation    of foreign visitors. As the Cultural Revolution unfolded, Mao became a regular    presence in every home, either in the form of his official portrait, or    as a bust or other type of statue. Not having the Mao portrait on display    indicated an apparent unwillingness to go with the revolutionary flow of    the moment, or even a counter-revolutionary outlook, and refuted the central    role Mao played not only in politics, but in the day-to-day affairs of the    people as well. The formal portrait often occupied the central place on    the family altar, or at least the spot where that altar had been located    before it had been demolished by Red Guards in the early days of the Cultural    Revolution. This added to the already god-like stature of Mao as it was    created in propaganda posters.    The days were structured around the ritual of \"asking for instructions    in the morning, thanking Mao for his kindness at noon, and reporting back    at night. &quot;This involved bowing three times, the singing of the national    anthem, reading passages from the Little Red Book in front of Mao's picture    or bust, and would end with wishing him 'Ten thousand years'. In the mornings,    everybody would announce what efforts they would make that day for the revolution.    In the evenings, people would report on their accomplishments or failures    and announce their resolutions for the next day. In the early 1970s, the    extreme and more religious aspects of Mao's personality cult were being    dismantled. In propaganda posters, proxies such as Lei Fengor one of his    reincarnationsand Chen Yonggui (the model Party secretary of Dazhai Commune)    often replaced Mao himself. This did not diminish the adulation of Mao,    who continued to lead the CCP as it was being rebuilt. The excesses committed    by the people during the heyday of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s,    including the embarrassing habit of \"3,000 years of emperor-worshipping    tradition\" which Mao himself had consciously promoted and in which he himself    had basked, were attributed to Lin Biao, who had quite literally fallen    from grace in 1971. Similarly, the Army, the former \"great school of Mao    Zedong Thought\", no longer functioned as a model for the people. Instead,    the \"fine work style\" of the CCP and the masses were what the army needed    to learn from. After the Cultural Revolution, the propagation of the divine    presence and the accomplishments of the supreme leader would never again    be repeated in the same intensity, sophistication, and mind-numbing density.    In the China of economic reforms and Open Door policy, the production of    posters containing ideological exhortations was replaced more and more in    the 1980s by those stressing economic construction, or even ordinary commercial    advertisements. In the early 1990s, a resurgence of the popular belief in    the protective qualities of a truly god-like Mao did take place.    This MaoFever coincided with the marking of the centenary of his birth.    The continued importance of Mao as a political symbol is attested to by    the issuance of a new 100-yuan bank note in 1999 to commemorate the 50th    anniversary of the PRC: the image of a youngish Mao graces the bill. He    moreover appeared in a special series of posters, also showing Deng Xiaoping    and Jiang Zemin (the so-called \"three generations of leaders\"), to mark    the occassion.

The theme is kidnapping,    or being held hostage. In MAO II, De Lillo writes about hostages in Beirut    but on another level, the writer is held hostage to his words, to his writing,    his computer or typewriter. In NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING, the journalists are    held hostage by Escobar's henchmen during the Colombian drug wars; in BLACK    WATER Kelly as Mary Jo is held hostage to The Senator (Kennedy) in a metaphor    for the Chappaquidic scandal. The HOSTAGE story reverses cultural expectations    by focusing on the vulnerability of boy toys as they are seduced by Islamic    princesses in guarded castles.    The purpose of this cluster is to take a common situation, kidnapping,    and examine how it is treated    by American, Colombian, and Islamic writers, male and female, not only in    terms of theme and event, but style, narrative organization, and characterization.    Joyce Carol Oates (born in 1938) had a working-class upbringing in upstate    New York, attended Syracuse and the University of Wisconsin, taught in Canada    where she began a prolific and highly successful writing career, culminating    in her appointment at Princeton University as the Roger S. Berlind Distinguished    Professor of Humanities. The ballad-like BLACK WATER (1992) was nominated    for a Pulitzer Prize. It reimagines the events of Chappaquiddick and the    death of Mary Jo Kopechne through the victim's eyes. Inspired by the interior    monologues in Joyce's ULYSSES and other stream-of-consciousness techniques,    Oates draws us into 26 year old Kelly Kelleher's distorted and damaged consciousness    as she is caught in the slow, repetitious, haunting labyrinth of death.    We are inundated with water at every turn and on every level, giving us    a unique understanding of the process of dying with all its associated memories,    fears and sensuality.    Gabriel Garcia Marquez' opening quote in THE SOLITUDE OF LATIN AMERICA:    \"It is only natural that they insist on measuring us with the yardstick    that they use for themselves, forgetting that the ravages of time are not    the same for all, and that the quest of our own identity is just as arduous    and bloody for us as it was for them. The interpretation of our reality    through patterns not our own serves only to make us ever more unknown, ever    less free, ever more solitary.\" GGM was born in 1928 in Aracataca, Colombia.    He won the Nobel Prize in 1982. The pristine, precise, factual and often    understated style of NEWS OF A KIDNAPPING contrasts remarkably with his    luscious, magical, linguistic jungle spanning ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE.    But like Sartre, Saadawi, Oates, Camus, Rushdie and others, he has the flexibility    to switch from expository journalism or didactic academicism to descriptive,    lyrical or poetic language.    Although DeLillo's style is postmodern in its deconstruction of sentences,    he is also hysterically funny and thought-provoking in his satire on American    cultural and social life. He thinks long and hard about America and the    world, and like Saadawi, Sartre, Camus, Wiesel, Khalifeh, Marquez, Remarque,    and Rushdie, he is not afraid to speak his mind incisively at the risk of    his unpopularity or criticism. Born in 1936, he was brought up in the Fordham    section of the Bronx, playing lots of ball, and studying communication arts    at Fordham. After five years in advertising, he embarked on a prolific,    productive and highly successful career as a novelist which forced him to    live, like Professor Evergreen, in a tiny Manhattan studio with no kitchen    and a broken down bathroom. Of course now he lives somewhere in Westchester--    Evergreen also spends time upstate in New Paltz. After a while the Manhattan    studio becomes its own prison, and writers hostages of McWorld, or penniless    refugees.    It is in MAO II that DeLillo simply and vividly describes his raison d'etre:    \"I am a sentence maker. Like a donut maker, only slower,\" or \"Every sentence    has a truth waiting at the end of it and the writer learns how to know it    when he finally gets there. On one level this truth is the swing of the    sentence, the beat and poise, but down deeper it's the integrity of the    writer as he matches with the language. I've always seen myself in sentences.    I begin to recognize myself, word by word, as I work through a sentence.    The language of my books has shaped me as a man. There's a moral force in    a sentence when it comes out right. It speaks the writer's will to live.\"    When you do the close textual analysis of MAO II, remember what DeLillo    says: \"The words typed on the page have a sculptural quality. They form    odd correspondences. They match up not just through meaning but through    sound and look. The rhythm of a sentence will accomodate a certain number    of syllables. One syllable too many, I look for another word. There's always    another word that means the same thing, and if it doesn't then I'll consider    altering the meaing of a sentence to keep the rhythm, the syllable beat.    I'm completely willing to let language press meaning upon me. Watching the    way in which words match up, keeping the balance in a sentence--these are    sensuous pleasures. I type rather than write longhand because I like the    way words and letters look when they come off the hammers onto the page--finished,    printed and beautifully formed. MAO II is about Bill Gray, a famous, obsessively    reclusive writer who lives with Scott, an alter ego, and his girlfriend    Karen a former Moonie. There is also Brita, a photographer who shoots only    writers, and leads Bill toward a confrontation with his own death.    Phrases like \"The future belongs to crowds,\" are made terrifyingly real    in his desciription of the weddings at the beginning and end of the book.    Even before our current wave of suicide terrorists, DeLillo said that the    death of the individual is necessary to accomplish the objectives of the    terrorist and the mass organization. DeLillo is inspired by images, images    of homeless living in Tompkins Square Park in New York, the Sheffield, England,    soccer tragedy, mourners in Teheran after the death of Khomeini, the Massacre    at Tiananmen Square, images usually mediated by television. When I teach    media studies, I usually include a book by DeLillo, usually WHITE NOISE.    I wonder what he will cook up for 9/11. Opening quote: \"...I do think we    can connect novelists and terrorists here. In a repressive society, a writer    can be deeply influential, but in a society that's filled with glut and    repetition and endless consumption, the act of terror may be the only meaningful    act. People who are in power make their arrangements in secret, largely    as a way of maintianing and furthering that power. People who are powerless    make an open theater of violence. True terror is a language and a vision.    There is a deep narrative structure to terrorist acts, and they infiltrate    and alter consciousness in ways that writers used to aspire to.\" After 9/11    were you more interested in watching the real life drama on TV or in reading    a book or seeing a movie? If terrorists have seized control of the world    narrative, if they have captured the historical imagination, have they become,    the world's new novelists? For sheer influence over the human mind, have    they displaced a precariously placed literature? Are writers--lacking some    greater if lethal faith-- the new hostages?    Mutee'Damaj creates an unusual, unstereotypical hostage situation in THE    HOSTAGE, originally published in 1984, about a youth from the countryside    taken hostage by the ruling Imam's soldiers to perform boy toy services    to the pampered, oppressed older women in the palace, only to fall in love    with the youngest, most beautiful single woman in the palace. Again, we    have more humor than we are used to seeing from western media coverage of    Islamic culture with the toothless women vying for the young studs, the    bestial mule sex episodes, and the desperate flights through the cemetery.    Like the other novels, it makes strong political statements but never at    the expense of the humanity of the characters, the style of the narrative.    It is set in the highlands of Yemen in the late 1940s, towards the end of    the time of the Imams and the beginning of the republican era. Remember    those pictures of Afhganistan? Well, this was worse, (or better if you are    an ecospiritualist): no piped water, surfaced roads, cars or engines, electricity,    telephones or radios. In terms of religious fundamentalism, these Yemeni    were akin to the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt, which many later joined, an    Arab old boys clique that nurtured the likes of Osama's colleague, Zawahiri    and possibly Mohammed Atta. THE HOSTAGE gives you an in-depth portrait of    the palace corruption with a new twist-- women abusing boys.    Cluster 6 looks at the concept of kidnapping, hostage-taking and the theater    of terrorism. Is Kelly a kind of hostage to the Senator? Think of recent    hostage situations with the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl and the stand-off    at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (spring 2002). How would YOU    feel as a hostage? How does Marquez treat the situation differently from    DeLillo? Although DeLillo is a superb stylist, he is as committed to content    as much as any of our writers in this course: \"My own personal preference    is for fiction that is steeped in history, that takes account of ways in    which our perceptions are being changed by events around us. Global events    that may alter how we live in the smallest ways.\"A kidnapping or hostage-taking    is an excellent plot device because of the built-in conflict, enforced relationship,    expectation and time deadline. Who would your character most hate to be    kidnapped by? How would your character react and change under a hostage    situation?       When you write your 9/11 memoir in the voice of your alter ego, feel free    to break into poetry. Billy Collins, Poet Laureate and adjunct Professor    in our program at NYU delivered the following poem to the 9/6/02 Congressional    meeting in Manhattan.    The Names    by Billy Collins    Yesterday, I lay awake in the palm of the night.    A fine rain stole in, unhelped by any breeze,    And when I saw the silver glaze on the windows,    I started with A, with Ackerman, as it happened,    Then Baxter and Calabro,    Davis and Eberling, names falling into place    As droplets fell through the dark.       Names printed on the ceiling of the night.    Names slipping around a waterby bend.    Twenty-six willows on the banks of a stream.       In the morning I walked out barefoot    Among thousands of flowers    Heavy with dew like the eyes of tears,    And each had a name--    Fiori inscribed on a yellow petal    Then Gonzalez and Han, Ishikawa and Jenkins.       Names written in the air    And stitched into the cloth of the day.    A name under a photograph taped to a mailbox.    Monogram on a torn shirt,    I see you spelled out on storefront windows    And on the bright unfurled awnings of this city.    I say the syllables as I turn on a corner--    Kelly and Lee,    Medina, Nardella, and O'Connor.       When I peer into the woods, I see a thick tangle where letters are hidden       As in a puzzle concocted for children.    Parker and quigley in the twigs of an ash,    Rizzo, Schubert, Torres, and Upton,    Secrets in the boughs of an ancient maple.       Names written in the pale sky.    Names rising in the updraft amid buildings.    Names silent in tone    Or cried out behind a door.    Names blown over the earth and out to sea.       In the evening--weakening light, the last swallows.    A boy on a lake lifts his oars.    A woman by a window puts a match to a candle--    And the names are outlined on the rose clouds--    Vanacore and Wallace,    (let X stand, if it can, for the ones unfound)    Then Young and Ziminsky, the final jolt of Z.       Names etched on the head of a pin.    One name spanning a bridge, another undergoing a tunnel.    A blue name needled into the skin.    Names of citizens, workers, mothers and fathers,    The bright-eyed daughter, the quick son.    Alphabet of names in green rows in a field.    Names in the small tracks of birds.    Names lifted from a hat    Or balanced on the tip of the tongue.    Names wheeled into the deep warehouse of memory.    So many names, there is barely room on the walls of the heart.    Read before Congress on September 6, 2002 in commemoration of the \"names\"    of those lost on September 11, 2001.                Too real for fiction ... the South tower of the World Trade Centre beginning to collapse.

How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence.

Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time?

We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art.
