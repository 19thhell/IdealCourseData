My book projects and articles traverse several disciplines and interdisciplines, but one through-line is an abiding interest in exploring how feelings are lived, experienced, and communicated between and across bodies\u2014and with what risks and possibilities for self and others. Another is the value of the aesthetic for repairing democratic social life. These two lines of interest converge insofar as I am keenly interested in the kinds of practices that make and un-make worlds. In all my work, I proceed with feminist and queer angles of vision as a way to put pressure on normative schemas of embodiment and subjectivity and to illuminate the cross-currents of gender, race, sexuality, and religion as they shape and impress the embodied life of feeling. These crossing or contact points do not always feel good. Far from it. They can even be points of democratic\u2014and psychic\u2014conflict. Social conflicts over difference are a key concern in my co-authored book with Janet R. Jakobsen, Love the Sin: Sexual Regulation and the Limits of Religious Tolerance (2004). Love the Sin analyzes debates over religion and sexuality in the United States. We are particularly interested in how \u201creligion\u201d is invoked\u2014even by the secular U.S. state\u2014to manage and contain supposedly \u201cthreatening\u201d social differences. Another joint project with Jakobsen, the edited volume Secularisms (2008), works explicitly to de-center U.S. conceptions of secularism. Both Love the Sin and Secularisms share a desire to disrupt the Enlightenment narrative that equates secularism with modernity, reason, freedom, peace, and progress. This narrative too often produces a forced choice between \u201cconservative\u201d religion and \u201cprogressive\u201d secularism, a choice not unlike the one often forwarded by secular gender and sexuality studies: to wit, between \u201cbad\u201d religion and the \u201cgoods\u201d of sexual liberation. In our work together, Jakobsen and I have consistently argued against such false choices, moving instead to consider how practices of sexual and religious freedom can be theorized in tandem with, rather than in constant opposition to, one another. My new solo book, Excess & Enchantment , examines how public performances of sexuality and religion converge across a diverse archive of visual and performance art, musical theatre, religious protest, and public displays of mourning. Throughout, I draw on the interdisciplinary methods and questions of gender and sexuality studies, performance studies, affect studies, and psychoanalysis. I have a long-standing interest in psychoanalysis as a critical method for understanding interactions between individuals and their social contexts, self and other, and the inner and outer lives of feeling. But psychoanalysis is not just a diverse body of theory irreducible to the proper name Freud; it is also a critical and creative practice in its own right.

All plays directed by second-year Drama Therapy Master's Candidates. Equity Approved Showcase. Photos available here .                         2014 Borderline    BORDERLINE is a groundbreaking new musical based on the true story of a former Broadway musical theatre actress diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. It is also the story of her intrepid therapist daring to step beyond her comfort zone in radically treating her client and in doing so, discovering her own transformation.    Actress Jill Powell and her therapist Dr. Cecilia Dintino invited Professor Robert Landy into 18 hours of intensive workshops. Dr. Landy created a script with songs, set to music by Tony Award-winning orchestrator Michael Starobin. A three-month engagement of therapeutic rehearsals under the direction of NYU faculty member Dave Mowers culminates in four public performances, November 13-16, at the Provincetown Playhouse. Read The New York Times feature here . And an interview with Robert Landy in At A Glance .       2014 Towards the Fear    This is a play exploring themes of bullying, social combat, and aggression through the performance of verbatim interviews conducted by the company. The show focused on personal experiences of being the aggressor, bystander, or victim in various situations throughout life and how these experiences affect individuals far after the initial event. In addition to investigating interview transcripts, research studies, and current media outlets, the show incorporated original movement pieces, original music, and audio/ visual compilations. Created by: Joe Salvatore and the company. Company: Kyla Blocker, Darci Burch, Yulissa Hidalgo, Wanning Jen, Arielle Sosland, Nikolai Steklov, Liane Tomasetti, Dennis Yacobucci, and Barbara Harrison (Assistant Director)    Read more here .    2014 Guns As Performance     This is a collection of four original one-act plays that explore our relationship with guns from a number of different vantage points. Three short plays directed by second year Drama Therapy Masters Candidates Nick Brunner, Laura Hix, Erin Hutchinson, and Vjosa Ramadani take aim at the ways gun play surfaces in our work as Drama Therapists. The fourth play, Confessions of a War Dog , a creative memoir written by those for whom guns and service are intimately linked, was presented by US Veterans of the Homefront Theatre directed by Marylou Lauricella.                     2013 ESMIN Four Years After     A woman named Esmin died in the psychiatric emergency room of a city hospital, her story evidence of a broken and disconnected system of health care. How did this happen? And how has this event affected both the organization and the individuals that work there? Interviews with staff are the basis for a performance exploring the frailties of a health care system after the death of a patient named Esmin. The play touches upon the challenges of working in a mental health setting, and how trauma affects both patients and staff alike. Through the words of those that work there, it looks at progress as well as the resistance to change when people or systems encounter a traumatic event. Conceived and written by Kate Hurd, Directed by Dave Mowers.               2013 Cancer as Changemaker     A therapeutic theatre project created from the emerging experience of Gaye Doner-Tudanger, who lives with metastatic breast cancer. As a collaborative arts-based research project, the performance included the lived experience of Gaye combined with the stories and narratives of other survivors, some of whom were a part of the ensemble. The building of the performance included personal narrative, embodied perspectives, social-relational experiences and political issues surrounding the experience of living with, and the specter of dying from cancer. Collaboratively conceived, directed and performed by Cecilia Dintino, Gaye Doner-Tudanger, and Gwendolyn Alker, and students of the Program in Drama Therapy: Alexandra Devin Vicich, Dominique Darrell, Prentiss Benjamin, Lisa Gail Schwartz, Sheryl Machlowitz, Rachael Bralow, and Kathryn Marie Clark.             2013 The Fading Body, One-Act Play Series    The Fading Body featured eight 10-minute plays that explored the phenomena of both the body&rsquo;s decline and transformation. The phrase &ldquo;the fading body&rdquo; roots us in the corporeal truths of our work as drama therapists and where we do it. In hospitals, clinics and rehabilitation centers our clients face the physical ramifications of illness from stroke to addiction to aging or abuse. And of course, the theater is a physical space, and performance is a phenomenon that engages the body. The plays investigated the nexus of Arts-based Research and Therapeutic Theater. Clinical drama therapists participated as artists, and artists explored a therapeutic process of expression. Featuring new plays by Eric Bernat, Cusi Cram, Robert Landy, Refiloe Lepere, Virginia Reed, John-Richard Thompson, Dana Trottier, and Sheri Wilner.    Photos from \"On The Floor\" are available here .             2012 The November Project: Suicide as Performance    This is original play about the interface between the lived experience of suicide and the theater. The November Project was conceived and created by the company itself as an ensemble production to explore this difficult subject. The company is made up of people who have attempted suicide, lost a loved one to suicide, or stayed up all night to prevent a suicide with the goal of getting closer to the lived emotional experience. Together the participants engaged in an improvisational journey combining acting techniques and drama therapy methods, and research to capture something of their collective experience.    A collaboration between Drama Lab NYC and the NYU Program in Drama Therapy. Directed by Cecilia Dintino, with the assistance of Jennifer Wilson. Cast: Jessica Asch, Prentiss Benjamin, James Capps, Kim DiMartini, Mindy Kuei, Adam Macy, Eddie Neve, Alexis Powell, Liah S. Rozenman, Lisa Gail Schwartz, Frank Senger, Pete Simms, Emilie Ward, Laura White, and Steven Yanovsky.    2012 Mama Always Said, &ldquo;Don't Play with Fire&rdquo;: Race as Performance    This performance arose out of a living inquiry into race and racism. Five NYU Drama Therapy students brought their critical sass and serious play to address important questions about identity, community, and social inequity: Is race playable? Can we use our practice of improvisation and performance to take apart and reveal the construct of race? Directed by Nisha Sajnani. Written and performed by Ashley Kleinman, Lizzie McAdam, Amber Smith, Dana Trottier, Britton Williams    2011 You Arrive: Trauma as Performance    You Arrive focused upon issues of trauma. Developed and performed by Dr. Bonnie Harnden, Associate Professor at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.    Concordia professor Bonnie Harnden has created a performance piece entitled You Arrive , which is about being in therapy and facilitating therapy. It follows one woman&rsquo;s experience in her therapist&rsquo;s office as she unravels the effects of early trauma and simultaneously illustrates the theories and experience that guide her therapist&rsquo;s work and interventions.    The clinical case emerges in a dynamic way as four actresses each play a different part of the same woman: her child self, her adolescent self, her false self, and her adult self. These selves tell her story from their own perspective, revealing what happened to them at that stage in life and how they were developmentally paralyzed by parental neglect and abuse. During the piece, these selves become integrated and the woman emerges from the therapy office whole. You Arrive is both an arresting and engaging play as well as an enlightening educational experience for therapists, clients, and anyone that has wondered about therapy.    More information:    This piece is an evolving arts-based research project by Bonnie Harnden , a professor at Concordia&rsquo;s drama therapy program in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This piece emerged from Harnden&rsquo;s work with traumatized children and their families at the Montreal children&rsquo;s hospital. It is also based upon her training as a psychoanalyst. Using performance ethnography this research seeks to illuminate viewers on the process of therapy, teaching therapists (and parents and children) how to help clients individuals &ldquo;arrive home&rdquo; in their bodies and in their experiences following familial traumatic experiences. It stands in a space of transformation between what we know with our bodies and what we know with are minds.    In this performance, body, theory and mind become integrated, embodied and illuminated. At this intersection of art, theatre and therapy, the process of therapy and the impact of trauma on the body and psyche becomes accessible and alive.    2011 Within: Mental Illness as Performance    WITHIN explores the personalities and feelings of people who often find themselves on the &ldquo;outside.\" WITHIN reflects the goals of Drama Lab NYC: part therapy, part community activism, part entertainment, part healing, part philosophical exploration.    Within was created by Drama Lab NYC. A therapeutic theatre company founded by Cecilia Dintino and Emilie Ward, and made up of individuals with mental illness, drama therapy professionals, drama therapy students and theatre professionals. The theme of Within is the institutionalization of the self after diagnosis with mental illness. The narrator of the play is a young woman who is researching the self and the role of mental illness. Throughout the play, the various roles portrayed represent &ldquo;half-selves&rdquo; or &ldquo;absent selves&rdquo; searching for connection. A father who is hijacked by aliens, a mother who can&rsquo;t be heard, a son whose self is split in two, an actress who is masking her truth, a patient who has lost her memory, another who has lost her eyesight, a mental health worker who has lost her capacity to empathize. As the play unfolds, all of the characters encounter something of their lost essence. The conclusion suggesting that our route to self is determined by our capacity to imagine and enroll. Directed by Cecilia Dintino and Emilie Ward.    About Drama Lab    Drama Lab was co-founded by Cecilia Dintino and Emilie Ward, both graduates of the NYU Drama Therapy Program, and both drama therapy professionals.

My book projects and articles traverse several disciplines and interdisciplines, but one through-line is an abiding interest in exploring how feelings are lived, experienced, and communicated between and across bodies\u2014and with what risks and possibilities for self and others. Another is the value of the aesthetic for repairing democratic social life. These two lines of interest converge insofar as I am keenly interested in the kinds of practices that make and un-make worlds. In all my work, I proceed with feminist and queer angles of vision as a way to put pressure on normative schemas of embodiment and subjectivity and to illuminate the cross-currents of gender, race, sexuality, and religion as they shape and impress the embodied life of feeling. These crossing or contact points do not always feel good. Far from it. They can even be points of democratic\u2014and psychic\u2014conflict. Social conflicts over difference are a key concern in my co-authored book with Janet R. Jakobsen, Love the Sin: Sexual Regulation and the Limits of Religious Tolerance (2004). Love the Sin analyzes debates over religion and sexuality in the United States. We are particularly interested in how \u201creligion\u201d is invoked\u2014even by the secular U.S. state\u2014to manage and contain supposedly \u201cthreatening\u201d social differences. Another joint project with Jakobsen, the edited volume Secularisms (2008), works explicitly to de-center U.S. conceptions of secularism. Both Love the Sin and Secularisms share a desire to disrupt the Enlightenment narrative that equates secularism with modernity, reason, freedom, peace, and progress. This narrative too often produces a forced choice between \u201cconservative\u201d religion and \u201cprogressive\u201d secularism, a choice not unlike the one often forwarded by secular gender and sexuality studies: to wit, between \u201cbad\u201d religion and the \u201cgoods\u201d of sexual liberation. In our work together, Jakobsen and I have consistently argued against such false choices, moving instead to consider how practices of sexual and religious freedom can be theorized in tandem with, rather than in constant opposition to, one another. My new solo book, Excess & Enchantment , examines how public performances of sexuality and religion converge across a diverse archive of visual and performance art, musical theatre, religious protest, and public displays of mourning. Throughout, I draw on the interdisciplinary methods and questions of gender and sexuality studies, performance studies, affect studies, and psychoanalysis. I have a long-standing interest in psychoanalysis as a critical method for understanding interactions between individuals and their social contexts, self and other, and the inner and outer lives of feeling. But psychoanalysis is not just a diverse body of theory irreducible to the proper name Freud; it is also a critical and creative practice in its own right. In fall 2014, I begin the Respecialization Program at the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research in New York City.

It is also the story of her intrepid therapist daring to step beyond her comfort zone in radically treating her client and in doing so, discovering her own transformation.    Actress Jill Powell and her therapist Dr. Cecilia Dintino invited Professor Robert Landy into 18 hours of intensive workshops. Dr. Landy created a script with songs, set to music by Tony Award-winning orchestrator Michael Starobin.

Read The New York Times feature here . And an interview with Robert Landy in At A Glance .       2014 Towards the Fear    This is a play exploring themes of bullying, social combat, and aggression through the performance of verbatim interviews conducted by the company. The show focused on personal experiences of being the aggressor, bystander, or victim in various situations throughout life and how these experiences affect individuals far after the initial event. In addition to investigating interview transcripts, research studies, and current media outlets, the show incorporated original movement pieces, original music, and audio/ visual compilations.

Company: Kyla Blocker, Darci Burch, Yulissa Hidalgo, Wanning Jen, Arielle Sosland, Nikolai Steklov, Liane Tomasetti, Dennis Yacobucci, and Barbara Harrison (Assistant Director)    Read more here .    2014 Guns As Performance     This is a collection of four original one-act plays that explore our relationship with guns from a number of different vantage points. Three short plays directed by second year Drama Therapy Masters Candidates Nick Brunner, Laura Hix, Erin Hutchinson, and Vjosa Ramadani take aim at the ways gun play surfaces in our work as Drama Therapists. The fourth play, Confessions of a War Dog , a creative memoir written by those for whom guns and service are intimately linked, was presented by US Veterans of the Homefront Theatre directed by Marylou Lauricella.                     2013 ESMIN Four Years After     A woman named Esmin died in the psychiatric emergency room of a city hospital, her story evidence of a broken and disconnected system of health care. How did this happen? And how has this event affected both the organization and the individuals that work there? Interviews with staff are the basis for a performance exploring the frailties of a health care system after the death of a patient named Esmin. The play touches upon the challenges of working in a mental health setting, and how trauma affects both patients and staff alike. Through the words of those that work there, it looks at progress as well as the resistance to change when people or systems encounter a traumatic event. Conceived and written by Kate Hurd, Directed by Dave Mowers.               2013 Cancer as Changemaker     A therapeutic theatre project created from the emerging experience of Gaye Doner-Tudanger, who lives with metastatic breast cancer. As a collaborative arts-based research project, the performance included the lived experience of Gaye combined with the stories and narratives of other survivors, some of whom were a part of the ensemble. The building of the performance included personal narrative, embodied perspectives, social-relational experiences and political issues surrounding the experience of living with, and the specter of dying from cancer. Collaboratively conceived, directed and performed by Cecilia Dintino, Gaye Doner-Tudanger, and Gwendolyn Alker, and students of the Program in Drama Therapy: Alexandra Devin Vicich, Dominique Darrell, Prentiss Benjamin, Lisa Gail Schwartz, Sheryl Machlowitz, Rachael Bralow, and Kathryn Marie Clark.             2013 The Fading Body, One-Act Play Series    The Fading Body featured eight 10-minute plays that explored the phenomena of both the body&rsquo;s decline and transformation. The phrase &ldquo;the fading body&rdquo; roots us in the corporeal truths of our work as drama therapists and where we do it. In hospitals, clinics and rehabilitation centers our clients face the physical ramifications of illness from stroke to addiction to aging or abuse. And of course, the theater is a physical space, and performance is a phenomenon that engages the body. The plays investigated the nexus of Arts-based Research and Therapeutic Theater. Clinical drama therapists participated as artists, and artists explored a therapeutic process of expression. Featuring new plays by Eric Bernat, Cusi Cram, Robert Landy, Refiloe Lepere, Virginia Reed, John-Richard Thompson, Dana Trottier, and Sheri Wilner.    Photos from \"On The Floor\" are available here .             2012 The November Project: Suicide as Performance    This is original play about the interface between the lived experience of suicide and the theater. The November Project was conceived and created by the company itself as an ensemble production to explore this difficult subject. The company is made up of people who have attempted suicide, lost a loved one to suicide, or stayed up all night to prevent a suicide with the goal of getting closer to the lived emotional experience. Together the participants engaged in an improvisational journey combining acting techniques and drama therapy methods, and research to capture something of their collective experience.    A collaboration between Drama Lab NYC and the NYU Program in Drama Therapy. Directed by Cecilia Dintino, with the assistance of Jennifer Wilson. Cast: Jessica Asch, Prentiss Benjamin, James Capps, Kim DiMartini, Mindy Kuei, Adam Macy, Eddie Neve, Alexis Powell, Liah S. Rozenman, Lisa Gail Schwartz, Frank Senger, Pete Simms, Emilie Ward, Laura White, and Steven Yanovsky.    2012 Mama Always Said, &ldquo;Don't Play with Fire&rdquo;: Race as Performance    This performance arose out of a living inquiry into race and racism. Five NYU Drama Therapy students brought their critical sass and serious play to address important questions about identity, community, and social inequity: Is race playable? Can we use our practice of improvisation and performance to take apart and reveal the construct of race? Directed by Nisha Sajnani. Written and performed by Ashley Kleinman, Lizzie McAdam, Amber Smith, Dana Trottier, Britton Williams    2011 You Arrive: Trauma as Performance    You Arrive focused upon issues of trauma. Developed and performed by Dr. Bonnie Harnden, Associate Professor at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.    Concordia professor Bonnie Harnden has created a performance piece entitled You Arrive , which is about being in therapy and facilitating therapy. It follows one woman&rsquo;s experience in her therapist&rsquo;s office as she unravels the effects of early trauma and simultaneously illustrates the theories and experience that guide her therapist&rsquo;s work and interventions.    The clinical case emerges in a dynamic way as four actresses each play a different part of the same woman: her child self, her adolescent self, her false self, and her adult self. These selves tell her story from their own perspective, revealing what happened to them at that stage in life and how they were developmentally paralyzed by parental neglect and abuse. During the piece, these selves become integrated and the woman emerges from the therapy office whole. You Arrive is both an arresting and engaging play as well as an enlightening educational experience for therapists, clients, and anyone that has wondered about therapy.    More information:    This piece is an evolving arts-based research project by Bonnie Harnden , a professor at Concordia&rsquo;s drama therapy program in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. This piece emerged from Harnden&rsquo;s work with traumatized children and their families at the Montreal children&rsquo;s hospital. It is also based upon her training as a psychoanalyst. Using performance ethnography this research seeks to illuminate viewers on the process of therapy, teaching therapists (and parents and children) how to help clients individuals &ldquo;arrive home&rdquo; in their bodies and in their experiences following familial traumatic experiences. It stands in a space of transformation between what we know with our bodies and what we know with are minds.    In this performance, body, theory and mind become integrated, embodied and illuminated. At this intersection of art, theatre and therapy, the process of therapy and the impact of trauma on the body and psyche becomes accessible and alive.    2011 Within: Mental Illness as Performance    WITHIN explores the personalities and feelings of people who often find themselves on the &ldquo;outside.\" WITHIN reflects the goals of Drama Lab NYC: part therapy, part community activism, part entertainment, part healing, part philosophical exploration.    Within was created by Drama Lab NYC. A therapeutic theatre company founded by Cecilia Dintino and Emilie Ward, and made up of individuals with mental illness, drama therapy professionals, drama therapy students and theatre professionals. The theme of Within is the institutionalization of the self after diagnosis with mental illness. The narrator of the play is a young woman who is researching the self and the role of mental illness. Throughout the play, the various roles portrayed represent &ldquo;half-selves&rdquo; or &ldquo;absent selves&rdquo; searching for connection. A father who is hijacked by aliens, a mother who can&rsquo;t be heard, a son whose self is split in two, an actress who is masking her truth, a patient who has lost her memory, another who has lost her eyesight, a mental health worker who has lost her capacity to empathize. As the play unfolds, all of the characters encounter something of their lost essence. The conclusion suggesting that our route to self is determined by our capacity to imagine and enroll.
