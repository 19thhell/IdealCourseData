His subsequent speeches revealed the path German culture would soon be taking. At the Hotel Kaiserhof on March 28, 1933, with the leading representatives of the German film industry present, Goebbels offered a combination of threats and seduction: In no uncertain terms, he demanded that all Jewish artists and filmmakers be excluded from the industry, while at the same time hinting that future film production would enjoy some freedom: \"We don\u2019t wish to suppress the creation of minor amusements, of the daily dosage against boredom and misery ... One shouldn\u2019t be engaged with ideology from morning to night. After all, we are very artistically and lightly inclined ourselves. Art is free and should remain free. However, it should get used to adapting to certain norms \u2026 From the point where censorship started, up to the film that will emerge as an example from the entire artistic creation, there is such large leeway that any artistic creativity can shape itself freely. Below that point, no deviation will be pardoned, because that is where dangerous experiments begin, all too often the excesses of sick minds.\" Within a few months, rules that would change German film production in fundamental ways were rapidly implemented. The new conditions for film production during National Socialism\u2014as opposed to the conditions during the Weimar Republic\u2014created a completely changed situation, which can be summarized as follows: Homogenization, concentration, and control reigned and replaced the diversity that had provided Weimar cinema with its international reputation. However, this wasn\u2019t about a total reshaping of German cinema. It was rather a gradual transformation of one popular film industry into another one, with the newly created one even turning out to be extremely successful and popular throughout the era of National Socialism. 1933 was the first year of this transformation: a year in which movies still produced under the former conditions were shown in theaters, in which films succeeded whose producers had already gone into exile, and in which the first films in compliance with the new conditions were created\u2014films that were, in fact, possible only under these conditions. This panel discussion, 1933: Transforming Weimar Cinema into Nazi Cinema, will explore this transformative year, during which the National Socialist cinema started emerging, and during which what would be excluded from it in the future was still alive.  Participants:  Noah Isenberg (moderator): Noah Isenberg is Director of Screen Studies and   Associate Professor of Culture and Media at Eugene Lang College-The New   School for Liberal Arts, where he teaches film, literature, and   intellectual history; he holds a joint appointment in the Committee on   Liberal Studies at the New School for Social Research.

Please note the following film exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art: The Weimar Touch (April 3\u2013May 6), the second annual collaboration between MoMA\u2019s Department of Film and the Deutsche Kinemathek (Museum f\u00fcr Film und Fernsehen), Berlin, features some 30 films, made between the end of the Weimar Republic and 1959, that were directly influenced\u2014through style, subject matter, and personnel\u2014by the golden age of German cinema (roughly 1920 to February 1933). The exhibition examines how films from many countries drew from the themes, aesthetic ideas, and talented filmmakers and crews that distinguished Weimar cinema, ranging from social cynicism and a recognition of the cruelty of the world, to laughter about mistaken identities and the sophisticated manipulation of light and shadow (both literal and metaphorical). The exhibition includes a mix of well-known classics and recently restored treasures, some of which have not been seen in decades. A version of this exhibition opened at the Berlin International Film Festival in February of this year.
