Environmental Conservation Education (NYU Steinhardt)   An intensive interdisciplinary MA program that involves students in a consideration of social, philosophical, political, and educational perspectives on the environment. The ECE program is the oldest graduate program in environmental studies in the U.S. with a foundation in environmental philosophy rather than science.   Master of Urban Planning (NYU Wagner)   This program not only provides students with an understanding of the economic, technological and social forces that shape metropolitan areas at home and abroad, it also equips them with the tools needed to confront the key challenges facing urban communities across the globe.    Certificate in Sustainable Design, Construction, and Development (SCPS Schack Institute of Real Estate)  This certificate program was created to clear a career path for those interested in equipping themselves to serve a vital public purpose and master an invaluable field of knowledge for future real estate practice.    CUSP (Center for Urban Science and Progress)  The Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) is a unique public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory and classroom to help cities around the world become more productive, livable, equitable, and resilient. CUSP observes, analyzes, and models cities to optimize outcomes, prototype new solutions, formalize new tools and processes, and develop new expertise/experts. These activities will make CUSP the world's leading authority in the emerging field of \"Urban Informatics.\"     Other programs with elective courses that focus on environmental issues:    Individualized Concentrations (NYU Gallatin)   Though Gallatin does not offer a degree with an explicit environmental focus, its interdisciplinary, individualized undergraduate and graduate degree programs have often lent themselves to environmental study. Students have access to courses across several different NYU schools, and many choose to develop sustainability-related concentrations by combining resources throughout the university. Gallatin itself also offers several environment-focused courses.    Interactive Telecommunications Program (NYU Tisch)   ITP challenges students to apply their creativity and imagination to the latest digital tools and techniques and push the boundaries of interactivity in the real and digital worlds. The development and use of interactive technologies can place heavy demand on our environment, but on the other hand, these technologies can be used to make a positive impact as well. Several sustainable design and renewable energy-related courses are offered.    Master of Science in Global Affairs (SCPS)  This M.S. Program offers a context for understanding critical issues in international politics, economics, dispute settlement, law, human rights, energy, the environment, and related areas.

Research divisions include Biostatistics, Human Exposure and Health Effects, and Epidemiology. The department offers a graduate program in Environmental Health Science.    Food Studies  Food Studies offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of food as a bio-cultural system focused on the urban environment.    Other Programs and Initiatives    Environmental Health Clinic  The Environmental Health Clinic at NYU is a clinic and lab, modeled on other health clinics at universities. However the project approaches health from an understanding of its dependence on external local environments; rather than on the internal biology and genetic predispositions of an individual.    Center for the Sustainable Built Environment (NYU SCPS)   The Center for the Sustainable Built Environment (SBE) at the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate fills the critical need to improve decision-making and sustainable practices in real estate and construction industries. The goal of SBE is to foster innovation in building technologies, public policies, and financial and regulatory mechanisms that will accelerate and expand the deployment of sustainable practices in the real estate and construction industries.    New York City Accelerator for a Clean and Renewable Economy (ACRE) (NYU-Poly)  The New York City Accelerator for a Clean and Renewable Economy (NYC ACRE) helps clean technology and renewable energy companies in New York City grow, advancing the City as a role model for environmental sustainability and smart growth. NYC ACRE is seeded by a four year, $1.6M grant from the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority (NYSERDA) to NYU-Poly aimed at growing an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, international companies, and innovative local businesses that are providing solutions to climate and energy issues while growing the cleantech/renewable energy sector and creating jobs in NYC.    Wallerstein Collaborative for Urban Environmental Education (NYU Steinhardt)  The Collaborative provides a year-round program which stimulates public school teachers in the metropolitan New York City region to bring environmental education into the classroom. The Collaborative also provides increased environmental education opportunities for pre-service teachers through direct experience in the urban environment.    GLOBAL Design NYU  GLOBAL Design NYU has as its mission to bring together current designers, educators, and innovators who are clustered in certain locations, but whose work is far-reaching in outlook. The GLOBAL Design lecture series are comprised to showcase potent innovation processes as it relates to visionary architecture, urbanism, ecological planning, and how this process of innovation ties to education.    Marron Institute  New York University's Marron Institute on Cities and the Urban Environment is an interdisciplinary and international effort to advance vital new research and teaching on cities and the urban environment.    Institute for Public Knowledge  The Institute for Public Knowledge (IPK) brings theoretically serious scholarship to bear on major public issues. Located at NYU, it nurtures collaboration among social researchers in New York and around the world. It builds bridges between university-based researchers and organizations pursuing practical action. It supports communication between researchers and broader publics. And it examines transformations in the public sphere, social science, and the university as a social institution as these change the conditions for public knowledge.

First, it is an ideal, yet to be attained by any urban place in the world but certainly achievable in the twenty-first century.\u201d         \u2014 Eugenie L. Birch and Susan M. Wachter                 (From Urban Greening and the Green City Ideal )                                                                 Previous              1        2              Next                                                  Urban Sustainability        At its foundation, NYU 2031 establishes a process for achieving sustainable growth. The plan is built on a core University philosophy that fostering community, protecting resources, and strengthening urban life are the best ways to grow responsibly.         This strategy not only encompasses physical expansion but also presents a methodology for evolving sustainably. It provides a way to fulfill the University's overarching objectives, create a new urban landscape that will benefit NYU's community and the city well into the future, introduce predictability and transparency to the University's planning efforts, and improve NYU's environmental impact.               NYU has joined New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's call to reduce the University's       carbon emissions by 30 percent, on a per-square-foot basis, by 2017, and successfully achieved that goal in 2011, well ahead of schedule. NYU has also signed on to the American College and University Presidents\u2019 Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) and has established a goal of reaching overall carbon neutrality by 2040.        The modern movement for sustainable growth represents a holistic approach to development, and its proponents often refer to the \"three Es\" of sustainability: equity, economy, and environment. NYU has taken the same approach in its long-term planning. It has detailed the importance that process has played in formulating NYU 2031\u2014an iterative, measured, responsive, and transparent course of action that NYU believes essential for its continued development. The University will proceed with the plan in the same manner.         This means providing appropriate stewardship in the historically significant areas that      require it, improving access to open space, and fostering social, economic, and cultural      vitality on individual streets and in neighborhoods through good urban planning and design. It also means strengthening NYU\u2019s own community by creating more viable internal spaces for social interaction, which has the added benefit of lessening the University\u2019s impact on the public realm.         The strategy builds on NYU\u2019s strengths as an urban university, deriving the best benefit      from the innate attributes that make great cities inherently sustainable. This can be seen      in how the plans maximize growth on the two NYU superblocks, making aggressive use of below-ground space and centering academic activities within the University\u2019s core, and in how the plans promote pedestrian uses while growing along transit routes, reinforcing NYU\u2019s identity as a primarily pedestrian landscape.         Additionally, NYU 2031 allows the University to reach its additional square footage goal      while continuing to reduce its impact on the environment. Maximizing the use of space and resources is central to the strategy, and it tries to accomplish this in many ways, including adaptive reuse of existing spaces, a commitment to LEED Silver standards for all new construction, and setting important benchmarks, such as carbon neutrality and waste reduction, as the University adheres to city and national program commitments.

The following ideas have informed the        planning and massing of building design for the NYU superblocks:          Adaptive Reuse: By integrating and revitalizing the existing buildings on the Washington Square Village superbock, the plan makes efficient reuse of completed structures, reducing the energy and material use associated with new construction.          Below-grade Use: The extensive use of below-grade areas reduces pressure on existing buildings in the neighborhood and focuses construction impacts in a smaller area. Below-grade buildings also require less energy to heat and cool since there is little loss through the perimeter and the temperature of the ground is more stable than that of the air.          Building Orientation and Massing: New buildings will be placed to maximize the amount of landscaped, at-grade space for common areas, circulation, and play space. The buildings\u2019 forms will be shaped to maximize solar access inside and out.
