Overall, this course will provide you with the   foundation to carefully evaluate environmental issues and make informed   decisions about them. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 204, Natural Science I: Einstein's Universe Prof. Weiner (Physics)  syllabus Einstein is best known for his Special Theory of Relativity - the idea that space and time are different for different observers, but the consequences of his work are much broader. The implications of this theory led to the ideas that provide the power source for the visible universe. His General Theory of Relativity revamped our understanding of space and time further. By giving us new insights into gravity, it led us to ideas of black holes and forced us to accept dark matter and dark energy as pervasive in the universe. The ideas of light - thought to be complete at the end of the nineteenth century - were turned on their head by his alternative take. In this course we will highlight these key concepts that he developed, and will study their implications in the 100 years since then, including our modern ideas of stars, their life and how they are powered. We will study the evidence for mystery \"dark matter\" in the universe and consider what it might be. We will discuss the expansion of the universe and what it tells us about the future of the universe and why it is such a puzzle. We will push back to the big bang and dip our toes into the multiverse, to see why physicists are increasingly considering it as a possible explanation for what we see around us. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 209, Natural Science I: Quarks to Cosmos Prof. Modjaz (Physics)  syllabus Modern science has provided us with some understanding of age-old fundamental questions, while at the same time opening up many new areas of investigation. How old is the Universe? How did galaxies, stars, and planets form? What are the fundamental constituents of matter and how do they combine to form the contents of the Universe? The course will cover measurements and chains of scientific reasoning that have allowed us to reconstruct the Big Bang by measuring little wisps of light reaching the Earth, to learn about sub-atomic particles by use of many-mile long machines, and to combine the two to understand the Universe as a whole from the sub-atomic particles of which it is composed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 214, Natural Science I: How Things Work Prof. Adler (Physics)  syllabus Do you know how electricity is generated? How instruments create music? What makes refrigerator magnets stick? For that matter, why is ice skating possible, how do wheels use friction and why can someone quickly remove a tablecloth without moving any dishes? All of the devices that define contemporary living are applications of basic scientific discoveries. The principles underlying these devices are fascinating as well as useful, and help to explain many of the features of the world around us. This course familiarizes you with some basic principles of physics by examining selected devices such as CD and DVD players, microwave ovens, the basic electronic components of computers, lasers and LEDs, magnetic resonance imaging as used in medicine, and even nuclear weapons. In learning the basic physics behind these modern inventions, you will develop a deeper understanding of how the physical world works and gain a new appreciation of everyday phenomena that are ordinarily taken for granted. The course is designed for non-science students with an interest in the natural world. The basic physical ideas needed to understand how things operate are presented using some mathematics, but none beyond elementary high school-level algebra.

FALL 2012 MAP-UA 203 Natural Science I: Energy and the Environment Prof. Lee (Chemistry) syllabus This course explores the scientific foundations of current environmental issues and the impact of this knowledge on public policy. One goal of the course is to examine several topics of pressing importance and lively debate in our society \u2013 e.g., global warming, the quest for clean air and water, atmospheric ozone depletion, and the continuing search for viable sources of energy. A parallel goal is to develop the chemical, physical, and quantitative principles that are necessary for a deeper understanding of these environmental issues. The relevant topics include the structure of atoms and molecules, the interaction of light with matter, energy relationships in chemical reactions, and the properties of acids and bases. Throughout the course we also examine how scientific studies of the environment are connected to political, economic and policy concerns. The laboratory experiments are closely integrated with the lecture topics and provide hands-on explorations of central course themes. Overall, this course will provide you with the foundation to carefully evaluate environmental issues and make informed decisions about them.

Note: This section open to first year CAS students only FALL 2012 MAP-UA 204 Natural Science I: Einstein's Universe Prof. Budick (Physics) Addresses the science and life of Einstein in the context of 20th-century physics, beginning with 19th-century ideas about light, space, and time in order to understand why Einstein's work was so innovative. Einstein's most influential ideas are contained in his theories of special relativity, which reformulated conceptions of space and time, and general relativity, which extended these ideas to gravitation. Both these theories are explored quantitatively, together with wide-ranging applications of these ideas, from the nuclear energy which powers the sun to black holes and the big bang theory of the birth of the universe. FALL 2012 MAP-UA 209 Natural Science I: Quarks to Cosmos Prof. Weiner (Physics) syllabus Modern science has provided us with some understanding of age-old fundamental questions, while at the same time opening up many new areas of investigation. How old is the Universe? How did galaxies, stars, and planets form? What are the fundamental constituents of matter and how do they combine to form the contents of the Universe? The course will cover measurements and chains of scientific reasoning that have allowed us to reconstruct the Big Bang by measuring little wisps of light reaching the Earth, to learn about sub-atomic particles by use of many-mile long machines, and to combine the two to understand the Universe as a whole from the sub-atomic particles of which it is composed.

FALL 2012 MAP-UA 214 Natural Science I: How Things Work Prof. Adler (Physics) syllabus Do you know how electricity is generated? How instruments create music? What makes refrigerator magnets stick? For that matter, why is ice skating possible, how do wheels use friction and why can someone quickly remove a tablecloth without moving any dishes? All of the devices that define contemporary living are applications of basic scientific discoveries. The principles underlying these devices are fascinating as well as useful, and help to explain many of the features of the world around us. This course familiarizes you with some basic principles of physics by examining selected devices such as CD and DVD players, microwave ovens, the basic electronic components of computers, lasers and LEDs, magnetic resonance imaging as used in medicine, and even nuclear weapons. In learning the basic physics behind these modern inventions, you will develop a deeper understanding of how the physical world works and gain a new appreciation of everyday phenomena that are ordinarily taken for granted. The course is designed for non-science students with an interest in the natural world. The basic physical ideas needed to understand how things operate are presented using some mathematics, but none beyond elementary high school-level algebra.

SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 209 Natural Science I: Quarks to Cosmos Prof. Modjaz (Physics)  syllabus This course aims to introduce you to the modern understanding of the (awesome!) universe. This is a big topic, so it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t get to everything, but topics to be included are: stars and their relatives, such as white dwarfs, neutrons stars, supernovae and black holes; the structures of the universe, namely galaxies and galaxy clusters; the expansion of the universe, and the big bang theory, and the light from the birth of the universe; the constituents of the universe, including \u201cordinary\u201d matter, dark matter and dark energy. We will emphasize not only the concepts, but how we have arrived at them, and the challenge of testing ideas about cosmology, when we only have one universe, and we can only directly probe a limited scope of it. This is an introductory, one-semester astronomy course with laboratory exercises designed for non-science majors.
