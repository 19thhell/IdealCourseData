Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 6 (f), page 79.                 Noise Mitigation        Prior to the start of construction, NYU will provide sound attenuating windows (either new windows or secondary storm windows) and new air conditioners or air conditioner covers for NYU buildings on the superblock site and non-NYU buildings on the periphery of the project site depending on their proximity to the zone of impact.            Updates     10/22/14: The measurement phase of the Silver Towers Window Replacement Project has been scheduled to begin in November. Residents can use this online form to confirm their measurement appointment or grant permission for the measuring team to enter their apartments. Read an FAQ about the ST Window Replacement Project \u00bb     9/10/14: In advance of the start of work, we have posted details about the project's scope and timeframe to the NYU Construction Page .   7/14/14: The measurement phase of the Washington Square Village Window Replacement Project has been scheduled to begin this month.

Read an FAQ about the WSV Window Replacement Project \u00bb     7/1/14: NYU will begin undertaking replacement of all single-paned windows throughout Washington Square Village with new double-paned windows. Additionally, existing air conditioning units will be insulated and sealed, and special sound-attenuating interior covers will be installed in apartments.                             A chart explaining which windows will be addressed during noise mitigation.            Resources:       Read letters from NYU Executive Vice President Allison Leary on the Washington Square Village and Silver Towers window replacement projects.       Timing: The sequence for noise mitigation will be determined in part by the construction phasing (which buildings are constructed first), currently under consideration by the President's Space Priorities Working Group.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.4 (e), page 57 , and in the image and table below.                 Maintenance and Protection of Traffic     For each new building project, NYU will prepare a plan and provide diagrams of proposed temporary curb lane and sidewalk closures (an MPT plan), including the duration of closures, the sidewalk protection measures to be installed for pedestrians, and other MPT items.       Timing: Prior to the construction of each of the new buildings.     Collaborators: Department of Transportation.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.1 (i), page 41.                Traffic Monitoring Plan   Due to the potential for transportation conditions to change over time, NYU will conduct a Traffic Monitoring Program (TMP) to determine the need for and any adjustments to transportation-related mitigation measures.       Timing: After the completion and occupancy of the LaGuardia Building.     Collaborators: Department of Transportation.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.4 (c)(iii), page 54.                Traffic Mitigation       NYU will pay the costs of any required traffic mitigation measures (or implement such measures directly) under the direction of DOT, including signal timing changes, widening of the crosswalk at W 4th Street and Washington Square East, and improving the interaction approach at Bleecker and Mercer Streets.       Timing: Mitigtaion implementation depends on the building being considered for construction.     Collaborators: Department of Transportation.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.4 (d), page 56, and section 4.4 (c), page 54.

Updated 11/1/13: Certain details of NYU's MWLBE Utilitization Plan have been finalized. Learn more at the in-depth MWLBE Utilization page \u00bb     Updated 7/1/13: NYU's MWLBE plan is in the process of being implemented.       Timing: From fall of 2012 and throughout construction.     Reference: NYU established a set of MWLBE participation goals as it received approval of its Core Expansion project during the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (&quot;ULURP&quot;) in July 2012.                 Landscape Improvements Compliance Report       NYU will hire an architect, landscape architect, or engineer to inspect new landscape improvements and confirm that NYU has met its obligations according to the Restrictive Declaration. The landscape inspector will issue an annual compliance report, submitting a draft report to the OSOO for comment before it is finalized.       Timing: Compliance reports will be issued annually. The first will be issued no later than June 30th of the year following that year in which the first permanent landscape improvement is completed.     Collaborators: The report's format must be approved by the director of City Planning. The final report will be submitted to the Chair of the City Planning Commission and the Commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 7.3 (b), page 92.                Boiler Stack Locations     NYU will locate the boiler stacks for new buildings on the southern superblock away from neighboring facilities. For the Bleecker Building and the southern portion of the Coles Redevelopment Project, the boiler stacks will be at least 30 feet from any potential rooftop playgrounds and at least 128 feet away from 505 LaGuardia.       Timing: To be part of the design/construction due diligence process for the Coles Redevelopment Project and Bleecker building.     Collaborators: To be developed in consultation with the Department of Parks and Recreation.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.2 (a), page 42.                Storm Water BMP   NYU will develop and implement one or more plans incorporating best management practices to reduce the rate of peak discharge to the combined sewer system on the superblocks.       Timing: NYU will submit best management plans to the Department of Environmental Protection prior to each building's development phase. Alternately, one consolidated plan may be submitted, providing that the DEP has a BMP for the relevant phase.     Collaborators: Department of Environmental Protection.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.3, page 48.                CoGen Tie-In   The Mercer Building, LaGuardia Building, and the northern portion of the Coles Redevelopment Project will be connected to NYU's cogeneration power plant.       Timing: To be part of the construction process for each building.   Collaborators: Department of City Planning   Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.2, page 42.                LEED Certification   NYU will use reasonable and good faith effort to obtain LEED Silver Certification for all new buildings.       Timing: To be part of the design/construction due diligence process for each building.     Collaborators: US Green Building Council     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.3, page 44.                Emissions Reduction   NYU will switch the fuel in the central heating plant to natural gas or No. 2 fuel oil, or to an alternative fuel that will result in the same or lower emissions, before the occupation of the Coles Redevelopment Project or Bleecker building.       Timing: Prior to the occupation of the Coles Redevelopment Project or Bleecker building.     Collaborators: Department of City Planning, only in the event that NYU chooses a fuel other than natural gas or No. 2 oil.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.2, page 42.

Collaborators: Department of City Planning   Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.3 (d)(i)(D)(iii), page 52.                Water Conservation     NYU will implement install water conservation strategies and measures such as low-flow toilets and faucets in order to arrive at 20 percent less than baseline water useage for new buildings.       Timing: To be part of the design/construction due diligence process for each building, prior to the receipt of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy for any new building.     Collaborators: Department of City Planning.     Reference: Restrictive Declaration section 4.3 (c), page 49.
