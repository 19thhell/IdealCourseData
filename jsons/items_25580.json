As part of the Tisch School, we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with film, television, theater, dance, and other forms of artistic human expression.   The Game Center is also a nexus for the New York City game community , where the industry\u2019s cutting edge meets groundbreaking creative research. Whether you are here as a full-time student, or just dropping by to take part in a workshop, lecture , or tournament , it\u2019s an amazing place to study games.      Game Center MFA   The Game Center MFA is a 2-year Masters of Fine Arts degree in Game Design that explores the design, analysis, and development of games as a creative practice. In our program, students create and study games to become industry leaders, experimental game artists, and trailblazing writers, theorists and curators. Over the two years, students find their voices as creative practitioners working on individual and group game projects, as well as through rigorous scholarly study of the theoretical and cultural aspects of games, all within the thriving community that is the NYU Game Center .     The program begins with a carefully crafted curriculum that covers game design, digital game programming and development, game studies and scholarship, and a historical survey of games on and off the computer. In the remaining semesters, students direct and shape their own study by choosing a variety of Game Center electives, along with courses from the Tisch School of the Arts and across New York University. \u00a0The MFA culminates in a 1-year thesis, which can take the form of a collaborative or solo game, an event or exhibition, paper or website, or any other kind of game-related research project.   Our students come from all over the world and from every background imaginable. Some hail from traditional game development areas like programming or animation &#8211; but many of our students come from film, philosophy, literature, economics, and just about any field you can imagine. What unites them all is creative talent, critical thinking, and a passion for making and studying games. On a practical level, every student that asks for financial aid gets assistance in some form. And we work hard to connect our students with internships and jobs, both during their stay at NYU and in their careers afterwards.   Find out more about the program here .      Game Design BFA   The Game Center BFA is a 4-year Bachelors of Fine Arts degree program that teaches the fundamentals of game design, game development, and critical scholarship. If you love games and you want to make them the focus of your career after college, the Game Design BFA is for you. Over the course of four years, you will learn about the theory and practice of making games on and off the computer. This includes everything from the history and scholarship of games to the psychology of player experience to the mathematics of game rules. Our graduates will be the game creators, critics, and scholars that will change the industry and the set the world on fire with play.   The focus of the BFA program is the rigorous study of games as a serious form of art. Creating games requires a wide range of skills, from visual design and animation to music and audio design, to programming and game design, to writing and storytelling, to production management and business strategy. How will you fit in? In the BFA Game Design program, all students begin by learning the fundamentals across a variety of fields. As you progress, you will find your own creative voice and decide how you want to focus your studies and your creative energies. Our curriculum is broad and deep, letting you focus on game programming, game design, visual design for games, game criticism, or other areas.   Good game designers have well-rounded educations. Being a student at New York University means that you will have access to world-class professors in other departments in NYU\u2019s Tisch School of Arts and across the entire university as a whole. And all of this will be taking place in New York City, one of the world\u2019s cultural capitals. New York City has an amazing game design community , and the NYU Game Center is one of its hubs.   If you have a passion for games, we want you to apply. You do not need to be a hardcore gamer or an experienced programmer!

The new multi-school cluster will co-locate teaching and research programs in games as a creative art form, game design, digital media design, computer science, and engineering \u2013 with each program retaining its department affiliation and school identity. It will include undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students from NYU and NYU-Poly. It will serve as the first space at NYU to co-locate faculty from different schools \u2013 including NYU-Poly, which will become the school of engineering at NYU in 2014 \u2013 creating a shared facility for collaborative teaching and research.    Christopher Hoadley, an associate professor in Steinhardt&#8217;s Department of Administration, Leadership, and Technology will be part of the team leading the effort. The team is comprised of R. Luke DuBois, an assistant professor of Integrated Digital Media at NYU-Poly and director of its Brooklyn Experimental Media Center; Katherine Isbister, associate professor jointly appointed between Computer Science and Engineering at NYU-Poly and the NYU Tisch School of the Arts\u2019 Game Center, and research director of NYU-Poly\u2019s Center of Innovation for Technology and Entertainment Game Innovation Lab; Frank Lantz, an associate arts professor at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and director of the NYU Game Center; and Ken Perlin, a professor of computer science in the Media Research Lab at NYU\u2019s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and director of the Games for Learning Institute.   \u201cWhat new forms of culture are being made possible by digital media? How are games and other interactive systems transforming our lives, our ideas, and the world we live in? MAGNET is a new approach to answering these questions by bringing together faculty and students from different disciplines in the same physical space,\u201d explained Lantz. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to cut across institutional boundaries and discover powerful new combinations of concepts, techniques, disciplines, and talent in order to learn from the past, engage with the present, and invent the future.\u201d   \u201cWe believe this facility will enable exactly the sort of learning that research shows is best: hands-on, with access to peer and expert feedback, as students apprentice to the wealth of research and design that our faculty bring,\u201d said Hoadley, director of the dolcelab, the Laboratory for Design of Learning Collaboration and Experience, and co-director of Steinhardt\u2019s educational technology graduate programs. \u201cThis space will be truly ready for technology as a core part of the learning. Students and faculty will have access to everything from whiteboards to projection throughout the facility to share ideas and spark creativity.\u201d   \u201cMAGNET will not only be a great enabler of collaboration within NYU\u2014it will be a powerful attractor for students deciding where to go for undergraduate or graduate study,\u201d added Isbister. \u201cI&#8217;ve already had students tell me this combination of faculty and programs coming together in this new cluster was a deciding factor.   \u201cBrooklyn has a vibrant arts and independent gaming community that already participates in many events at the NYU-Poly Game Innovation Lab. Having MAGNET in place will bring a much larger and diverse group of students and faculty into the mix, creating even more cross-traffic between Brooklyn indies, artists, and start-ups and the NYU/NYU-Poly community.\u201d   \u201cThis is truly a rare opportunity to break down the walls that too often divide technology and the arts,\u201d noted Perlin.   \u201cThe opportunity to collaborate in a single facility with colleagues from so many other NYU programs that have invested in media research, gaming, and education is tremendous,\u201d said DuBois, who also has appointments in the Interactive Telecommunications Program at Tisch and in the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions at Steinhardt. \u201cOur research is explicitly interdisciplinary and outward-facing, and we look forward to having such a great, state-of-the-art facility right in Downtown Brooklyn.\u201d   The facility is designed to allow faculty and students working in complementary fields to share resources and forge connections. The new space\u2014designed collaboratively by the partner schools\u2014will enable inter-school and inter-disciplinary collaboration, and will provide flexibility to accommodate current needs, future technology, and the development of new curriculum. Among the site\u2019s features are: power and data infrastructure to support gallery-like shows, research studies, and student projects; classrooms equipped with instructional technology; and specialized spaces for audio engineering, motion capture, and digital arts.   \u201cNYU has emerged as one of the top universities in the country in game design and game studies, a tribute to its faculty strengths in the multiple disciplines making up the field,\u201d said NYU Provost David McLaughlin. \u201cThe creation of MAGNET, which grew organically out of the interlocking and vibrant research collaborations that had already brought together faculty in these programs, will only enhance NYU\u2019s profile in this cutting-edge sector of technology.\u201d   Beginning in the fall semester of 2013, the space will house graduate programs in Game Design (MFA, Tisch); Games for Learning (MS), Digital Media Design for Learning (MA), and Educational Communications and Technology (Ph.D.) from Steinhardt; and Integrated Digital Media (MS, NYU-Poly). MAGNET will also house undergraduate majors in Integrated Digital Media (BS, NYU-Poly) and minors in Game Engineering (Computer Science and Engineering, NYU-Poly).   MAGNET will be located in newly renovated space of nearly 40,000 square feet on the 8th floor of 2 MetroTech Center. It has been designed by Gensler Architects, in collaboration with the facility\u2019s partner schools, to provide offices, studio and work spaces, teaching labs, and research areas.
