The first portion of the course is dedicated to instruction, exercises, and reading familiarizing students with fundamentals of video production and their application to a broad conception of ethnographic and documentary approaches. Assignments undertaken in the fall raise representational, methodological, and ethical issues in approaching and working through an ethnographic and documentary project. Students develop a topic and field site for their project early in the fall term, begin their shooting, and complete a short edited tape by the end of the first semester. This work should demonstrate competence in shooting and editing using HD digital video cameras, professional audio equipment, and Final Cut Pro non-linear editing systems. Students devote the spring semester to intensive work on the project, continuing to shoot and edit, presenting work to the class and completing their ethnographic documentaries. Every year new documentaries from the video production seminar are presented in a public screening at \"Docs On the Edge: A Documentary Showcase.\" Many of these works have been featured at film festivals and picked up for distribution, as noted in the information on each piece.        2014    Brooklyn Slice by Anna Green   Pizza is a quintessential, even iconic New York food, and John Minaci Jr. is a quintessential New Yorker.
