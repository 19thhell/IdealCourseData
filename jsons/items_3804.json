It is true that         quantitative finance is a strongly specialized         industry that will continue         to experience periods of strong growth         alternating with periods of cutbacks.         But along with this cyclical pattern, there is         also a strong trend for a         greater share of jobs in the industry to         require solid quantitative skills         of the kind our program emphasizes. We have         received repeated feedback from         our graduates and from their employers         indicating that these skills are         highly valued and form a strong basis for a         career that is rewarding in         terms of interesting work, financial         compensation, and potential for         advancement.          For the last few years, the track record of         graduates of the full-time         program has been excellent with our graduates         obtaining good quantitative         jobs with top firms primarily in the New York         financial industry. Nearly         100% of our January graduates accepted full         time positions within three         months of graduation. Examples of employers         and types of jobs found by         graduates can be found here .          Moreover, hiring is taking place earlier in         the year. Most         students had job offers by graduation.                   The track record for internships is equally         strong. Nearly 100% of         full-time students found internships for the         past few years. Examples         of internships found by students in summer         2011 can be found here .          But finding good jobs and internships will         always require diligent effort by the         individual student.
