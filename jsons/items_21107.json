Feb 04, 2015       Jordan Fullam, a TACD staff member and Metro graduate student has just published his first article in Educational Theory ! Abstract: The popularity of Jacques Ranci&egrave;re in recent work in educational philosophy has rejuvenated discussion of the merits and weaknesses of Socratic education, both in Plato&rsquo;s dialogues and in invocations of Socrates in contemporary educational practice. In this essay Jordan Fullam explores the implications of this trend through comparing Ranci&egrave;re&rsquo;s educational thought to an analysis of the relationship between dialectic and stultification in Plato&rsquo;s Republic. This task clarifies what is useful in the recent wave of scholarship that brings Ranci&egrave;re&rsquo;s work to bear upon Socratic education, and what we might redeem in the practice of teaching that Plato assigns to the character of Socrates in the Republic. Fullam also draws on the educational literature on Socratic education to provide further context to explore the usefulness of both Ranci&egrave;re and Socrates for contemporary teaching.

This task clarifies what is useful in the recent wave of scholarship that brings Ranci&egrave;re&rsquo;s work to bear upon Socratic education, and what we might redeem in the practice of teaching that Plato assigns to the character of Socrates in the Republic. Fullam also draws on the educational literature on Socratic education to provide further context to explore the usefulness of both Ranci&egrave;re and Socrates for contemporary teaching.

Hultin unveiled \u201ci 2 e Campus Transformation,\u201d Polytechnic Institute of NYU\u2019s plan to redesign areas of its Brooklyn campus, at a Town Hall on January 20. \u201cThe goal now is to turn this into a campus that exudes innovation, invention, and entrepreneurship,\u201d he said, speaking at Pfizer Auditorium.   Dennis Dintino, interim vice president of finance and administration and chair of the project\u2019s steering committee, echoed that sentiment when he said, \u201cWe want a campus transformation that supports students and faculty but that provides innovative and collaborative work spaces as we go forward.\u201d   Dintino provided information about the project\u2019s framework, such as its timeline (it\u2019ll consist of three phases: 1 to 3, 3 to 5, and 5 to 10 years) and its funding ($50 million initially with fundraising targets eyeing $150 to $200 million more as the decade progresses).    January 21st, 2010 View Slideshow  i\u00b2e Campus Transformation Kickoff Town Hall Members of the project team from Jonathan Rose Companies, the firm NYU-Poly selected as its owner\u2019s representative for i 2 e Campus Transformation, steered the lively Town Hall gathering through an overview of the project, covering its driving principles (sustainability goals and a transparent decision-making process, for instance) and introducing design ideas for the audience to consider during the question-and-answer period that followed.     Jonathan Rose, the company\u2019s founder, presented examples of grand architectural transformations attendees were encouraged to draw inspiration from, including before-and-after images of Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall and the new Cooper Union Building. He also shared examples of form meeting function in research and teaching labs with data and electrical ports suspended from the ceiling, enabling students, faculty, and researchers to easily move wheeled stations as needed. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to design not just for the next 10 years, but for the next 50,\u201d said Rose.   Audience members responded enthusiastically, with students, faculty, and administrators queuing to ask questions and provide comments. Proposals ranged from extra recreational spaces to creating continuity between the look and feel of the campus\u2019 two main buildings, Rogers Hall and the Dibner Building. \u201cThe public outreach is good,\u201d said attendee Brian Gill, a graduate student in NYU-Poly\u2019s civil engineering master\u2019s program.   \u201cThe best way to get funding is to get everybody aboard,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you inspire people, if you do something that hasn\u2019t been done before \u2014 wow, that will really get people\u2019s attention.\u201d   President Hultin encouraged such involvement, reminding attendees of their stake in the project. \u201cStaying engaged is as much as your responsibility as it is ours,\u201d he said during closing remarks.   Interested parties can look forward to at least three more i 2 e Campus Transformation public workshops where they can share additional ideas that will shape NYU-Poly\u2019s future.
