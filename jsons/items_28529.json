The curriculum emphasizes project-based learning. Students, faculty and visiting talent work on editorial and web development projects together, typically with media partners who themselves need to find new approaches or face problems in succeeding online. By participating in these projects and later running their own project, students learn to grapple with all the factors that go into updating journalism for the digital era. The program seeks to draw together a diversely talented team of students who can produce excellent work that pushes the field forward and realizes some of the possibilities inherent in a multi-media, interactive and constantly evolving platform for journalism\u2014 namely, the World Wide Web and its mobile extensions.\u00a0 Studio classes provide a \"hub\" for organizing activity and a common space for inquiry and reflection around the program's various projects. Students are expected to be flexible and curious, generous in sharing skills, eager to pick up new knowledge and willing to adapt to what the project \u2014 and its deadlines \u2014 demand.\u00a0 The curriculum has three parts: 1.) the traditional requirements of two basic reporting classes plus \"digital thinking;\" 2.) a core of three project-based classes called Studio I, II and III; and 3.) elective enrichment courses that allow students to pursue interests and work on initiatives of their own. In their third and final semester, students design\u00a0 their own projects \u00a0with an appropriate media partner and try to create innovation--as well as a name--for themselves.   For a list of typical projects go here .   Each year Studio 20 recruits a mix of writers, editors, videographers, audio journalists, programmers, designers, Web producers and smart people who may have no journalism training at all\u2014 under the principle of \"bring skills, share skills, learn new stuff.\" Recruiting emphasizes students comfortable in more than one medium and ready to tackle new challenges. One of our mottos is: \"Everyone works on everything.\" In 2009-10, one of Studio 20's major partners was the New York Times. Working with editors at the Times, students and faculty designed and planned a hyperlocal news site for the East Village neighborhood in Manhattan. It launched in September, 2010:\u00a0 The Local East Village . The site was edited and produced at NYU, but ran on nytimes.com Studio 20 students could publish there, and if they had ideas for improvements they could pitch them.   In the spring of 2013 that site evolved into Bedford + Bowery , which is co-published by NYU Journalism and New York Magazine (nymag.com). The editor, Daniel Maurer, explained at the time: \"We\u2019ll still be covering the East Village and Lower East Side but we\u2019ll also be jumping on the L train to cover Williamsburg, Bushwick and Greenpoint \u2013 where, of course, the East Village already has a\u00a0 strong presence.\" \u00a0The\u00a0change was covered here .   In 2010-11 Studio 20's major project was a\u00a0 collaboration \u00a0with ProPublica, the investigative reporting non-profit. Students experimented with the genre of \"the explainer,\" a form of journalism that provides essential background knowledge and brings clarity to complex issues in the news. Read more\u00a0 here \u00a0and see the project site,\u00a0 Explainer.net . Don't miss\u00a0 The Fracking Song , which came out of that work. Time magazine named it one of the most creative videos of 2011.\u00a0 In December of 2010, NYU\u00a0 announced \u00a0that the renowned Internet thinker\u00a0 Clay Shirky \u00a0would be joining the Carter Institute and Studio 20, where he will teach courses and consult on projects.\u00a0   In 2011-12, Studio 20's major project was a collaboration with The Guardian around a different approach to election coverage. You can read about it here \u00a0and here .\u00a0   In 2012-13, Studio 20's big project revolved around networked reporting. Five media partners were involved: The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica (again), Fast Company, Mashable.com and Pando Daily. You can read about it here and here . The Pando Daily project was featured\u00a0 here .   Our students get jobs in new media and old , and they advance in their careers.

The curriculum emphasizes project-based learning. Students, faculty and visiting talent work on editorial and web development projects together, typically with media partners who themselves need to find new approaches or face problems in succeeding online. By participating in these projects and later running their own project, students learn to grapple with all the factors that go into updating journalism for the digital era. The program seeks to draw together a diversely talented team of students who can produce excellent work that pushes the field forward and realizes some of the possibilities inherent in a multi-media, interactive and constantly evolving platform for journalism\u2014 namely, the World Wide Web and its mobile extensions.\u00a0 Studio classes provide a \"hub\" for organizing activity and a common space for inquiry and reflection around the program's various projects. Students are expected to be flexible and curious, generous in sharing skills, eager to pick up new knowledge and willing to adapt to what the project \u2014 and its deadlines \u2014 demand.\u00a0 The curriculum has three parts: 1.) the traditional requirements of two basic reporting classes plus \"digital thinking;\" 2.) a core of three project-based classes called Studio I, II and III; and 3.) elective enrichment courses that allow students to pursue interests and work on initiatives of their own. In their third and final semester, students design\u00a0 their own projects \u00a0with an appropriate media partner and try to create innovation--as well as a name--for themselves.   For a list of typical projects go here .   Each year Studio 20 recruits a mix of writers, editors, videographers, audio journalists, programmers, designers, Web producers and smart people who may have no journalism training at all\u2014 under the principle of \"bring skills, share skills, learn new stuff.\" Recruiting emphasizes students comfortable in more than one medium and ready to tackle new challenges. One of our mottos is: \"Everyone works on everything.\" In 2009-10, one of Studio 20's major partners was the New York Times. Working with editors at the Times, students and faculty designed and planned a hyperlocal news site for the East Village neighborhood in Manhattan. It launched in September, 2010:\u00a0 The Local East Village . The site was edited and produced at NYU, but ran on nytimes.com Studio 20 students could publish there, and if they had ideas for improvements they could pitch them.   In the spring of 2013 that site evolved into Bedford + Bowery , which is co-published by NYU Journalism and New York Magazine (nymag.com). The editor, Daniel Maurer, explained at the time: \"We\u2019ll still be covering the East Village and Lower East Side but we\u2019ll also be jumping on the L train to cover Williamsburg, Bushwick and Greenpoint \u2013 where, of course, the East Village already has a\u00a0 strong presence.\" \u00a0The\u00a0change was covered here .   In 2010-11 Studio 20's major project was a\u00a0 collaboration \u00a0with ProPublica, the investigative reporting non-profit. Students experimented with the genre of \"the explainer,\" a form of journalism that provides essential background knowledge and brings clarity to complex issues in the news. Read more\u00a0 here \u00a0and see the project site,\u00a0 Explainer.net . Don't miss\u00a0 The Fracking Song , which came out of that work. Time magazine named it one of the most creative videos of 2011.\u00a0 In December of 2010, NYU\u00a0 announced \u00a0that the renowned Internet thinker\u00a0 Clay Shirky \u00a0would be joining the Carter Institute and Studio 20, where he will teach courses and consult on projects.\u00a0   In 2011-12, Studio 20's major project was a collaboration with The Guardian around a different approach to election coverage. You can read about it here \u00a0and here .\u00a0   In 2012-13, Studio 20's big project revolved around networked reporting. Five media partners were involved: The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica (again), Fast Company, Mashable.com and Pando Daily. You can read about it here and here .

The curriculum emphasizes project-based learning. Students, faculty and visiting talent work on editorial and web development projects together, typically with media partners who themselves need to find new approaches or face problems in succeeding online. By participating in these projects and later running their own project, students learn to grapple with all the factors that go into updating journalism for the digital era. The program seeks to draw together a diversely talented team of students who can produce excellent work that pushes the field forward and realizes some of the possibilities inherent in a multi-media, interactive and constantly evolving platform for journalism\u2014 namely, the World Wide Web and its mobile extensions.\u00a0 Studio classes provide a \"hub\" for organizing activity and a common space for inquiry and reflection around the program's various projects. Students are expected to be flexible and curious, generous in sharing skills, eager to pick up new knowledge and willing to adapt to what the project \u2014 and its deadlines \u2014 demand.\u00a0 The curriculum has three parts: 1.) the traditional requirements of two basic reporting classes plus \"digital thinking;\" 2.) a core of three project-based classes called Studio I, II and III; and 3.) elective enrichment courses that allow students to pursue interests and work on initiatives of their own. In their third and final semester, students design\u00a0 their own projects \u00a0with an appropriate media partner and try to create innovation--as well as a name--for themselves.   For a list of typical projects go here .   Each year Studio 20 recruits a mix of writers, editors, videographers, audio journalists, programmers, designers, Web producers and smart people who may have no journalism training at all\u2014 under the principle of \"bring skills, share skills, learn new stuff.\" Recruiting emphasizes students comfortable in more than one medium and ready to tackle new challenges. One of our mottos is: \"Everyone works on everything.\" In 2009-10, one of Studio 20's major partners was the New York Times. Working with editors at the Times, students and faculty designed and planned a hyperlocal news site for the East Village neighborhood in Manhattan. It launched in September, 2010:\u00a0 The Local East Village . The site was edited and produced at NYU, but ran on nytimes.com Studio 20 students could publish there, and if they had ideas for improvements they could pitch them.   In the spring of 2013 that site evolved into Bedford + Bowery , which is co-published by NYU Journalism and New York Magazine (nymag.com). The editor, Daniel Maurer, explained at the time: \"We\u2019ll still be covering the East Village and Lower East Side but we\u2019ll also be jumping on the L train to cover Williamsburg, Bushwick and Greenpoint \u2013 where, of course, the East Village already has a\u00a0 strong presence.\" \u00a0The\u00a0change was covered here .   In 2010-11 Studio 20's major project was a\u00a0 collaboration \u00a0with ProPublica, the investigative reporting non-profit. Students experimented with the genre of \"the explainer,\" a form of journalism that provides essential background knowledge and brings clarity to complex issues in the news. Read more\u00a0 here \u00a0and see the project site,\u00a0 Explainer.net . Don't miss\u00a0 The Fracking Song , which came out of that work. Time magazine named it one of the most creative videos of 2011.\u00a0 In December of 2010, NYU\u00a0 announced \u00a0that the renowned Internet thinker\u00a0 Clay Shirky \u00a0would be joining the Carter Institute and Studio 20, where he will teach courses and consult on projects.\u00a0   In 2011-12, Studio 20's major project was a collaboration with The Guardian around a different approach to election coverage. You can read about it here \u00a0and here .\u00a0   In 2012-13, Studio 20's big project revolved around networked reporting. Five media partners were involved: The Wall Street Journal, ProPublica (again), Fast Company, Mashable.com and Pando Daily. You can read about it here and here . The Pando Daily project was featured\u00a0 here .   Our students get jobs in new media and old , and they advance in their careers.
