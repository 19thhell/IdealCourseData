Cooley, C. Samuel Craig, Spike Lee, and John Tintori.    Bridging the gap between the \u201ccreatives\u201d and the \u201csuits,\u201d New York University has announced a new dual-degree graduate program that will give aspiring film producers the knowledge to navigate the fast-changing landscape of financing and filmmaking today. The joint MBA/MFA degree is a partnership between NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business and Kanbar Institute of Film and Television at the Tisch School of the Arts, both highly regarded in their fields.    The new MBA/MFA degree is a three-year program that will enable students to pursue both degrees simultaneously. It is expected to attract the very best producing candidates by focusing on both the creative and business sides of film. Designed to be the most comprehensive of its kind, using the top faculty and resources of each School, the dual-degree program will produce highly employable individuals sought by the major film studios, independent production companies, and the major television studios and networks.    As the cost of filmmaking skyrockets, with pools of capital increasingly coming from industry outsiders such as hedge funds and investment banks, and as media convergence accelerates, the need for producers to have a broad understanding of finance, marketing, management, and new technology, as well as a fundamental grounding in the creative side of filmmaking, is increasingly apparent. Graduates of the new program will be uniquely competent creative producers for all forms of film, video, and digital entertainment.    \u201cWe\u2019re excited by the conjoining of these two Masters degree programs-film and business-that will result in the creation of the most comprehensive joint graduate degree in producing a student can pursue today,\u201d said Mary Schmidt Campbell, dean of the Tisch School of the Arts and associate provost of the arts at NYU. \u201cThe way films are being made, financed, and distributed is changing, and we think it is incumbent upon us to anticipate the future and develop the educational tools necessary for the next generation of producers to meet the new demands of the entertainment industry.\u201d    \u201cNew York City\u2019s film industry is the second largest after Hollywood, and contributes $5 billion annually to the city\u2019s economy, according to the Mayor\u2019s office,\u201d said Thomas F. Cooley, dean of the Stern School of Business. \u201cMedia and finance converge here in New York City, so NYU is in a unique position to be able to offer future filmmakers a world-class business and world-class film education that reflects current market realities.\u201d    About the MBA/MFA Program    Students who enroll in the MBA/MFA will take core and elective courses taught by Stern and Tisch Kanbar faculty, earning a total of 111 credits over the course of three years, including two summer semesters. The first year will be at Stern, the second will be at Kanbar, and the third will be split between the two schools. This dual-degree option enables students to receive both degrees in one to two years less than if they completed the MBA and MFA programs separately. Interested candidates must submit applications to Stern and Kanbar and be accepted by both schools, and the program will commence in Fall 2008. Since the first year of the dual-degree program starts at Stern, interested Stern students who enroll in Fall 2007 to the MBA program will also be eligible to apply.    Scholarships Available    An anonymous donor, who is in the midst of an unusual career spanning both traditional asset management, and film financing and production, has endowed a scholarship fund of nearly $1 million for this new MBA/MFA dual-degree program.    Stern and Kanbar Build on a History of Collaboration    NYU\u2019s Stern and Kanbar joint MBA/MFA builds on a history of pedagogical and co-curricular partnership. Recognizing the untapped potential of bringing together the \u201csuits and creatives,\u201d two Stern MBA alumni conceptualized the NYU Stern Promotion Pictures Film Competition in 2004, in which Stern and Kanbar graduate students produce corporate-funded branded entertainment films for major companies, many of which are subsequently used as part of the company\u2019s marketing campaign. Johnny Walker is the latest client in a corporate portfolio that has included Volvo, Verizon, Heineken, and Unilever\u2019s Axe brand, for which award-winning filmmaker, and Kanbar alumnus and professor Spike Lee, provided early script comments to guide the competition\u2019s filmmakers.    The Promotion Pictures Film competition grew out of Stern\u2019s Entertainment, Media and Technology (EMT) program, a multidisciplinary initiative introduced in 1997. The EMT program blends theory with practical applications, enabling students to gain a broad understanding of the strategy and operating principles that drive the individual sectors of the entertainment industry in preparation for pursuing careers in the field.
