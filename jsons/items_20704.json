You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

The transfer admission process is highly selective. Students who are the most competitive typically present extraordinary records of achievement at the undergraduate and secondary school levels. To be considered for admission as a transfer student, you must complete specific coursework before your transfer. The most up-to-date course requirements can be found on the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions webpage here: Additional Program Requirements .

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

No prerequisites are required for admission for college transfer students. Transfer students can receive credit for courses taken at previous schools, allowing individualized course progression.
