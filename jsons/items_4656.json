It offers programs leading to the Master of Arts degree in Italian, the Master of Arts degree in Italian Studies, and the Ph.D. degree in Italian. Courses are taught by an outstanding faculty with specialization in key areas of Italian literature and cultural history. Specific strengths of the faculty lie in the fields of medieval and Renaissance studies, 20th-century literature, film, and culture; postmodern Italy; the application of new technologies to the humanities; and cultural theory. In addition to courses taught by faculty members, the program offers courses taught by eminent visiting professors from Italy and the United States. The recently established Tiro a Segno fellowship in Italian-American culture allows the department to appoint prominent visiting professors to teach courses concerning the experience and contribution of Italian immigrants and Italian Americans to American culture and society.    The Italian program attracts full-time graduate students of superior quality from all parts of the world. In addition to training capable and creative scholars, one of the program's objectives is to promote the effective teaching of Italian at all levels. To this end, students teach several Italian language and literature courses, normally during the second and third years. The Italian program also welcomes qualified part-time students who wish to obtain a master\u2019s degree. An interdisciplinary approach is recommended: students are encouraged to enroll in additional courses outside of the department, e.g., courses in history, cinema, comparative literature, and the fine arts.    NYU offers graduate students in Italian a number of unique resources. Students may take courses, pursue dissertation research, and do independent work at magnificent Villa La Pietra, NYU\u2019s center for study abroad in Florence, and at the Universit\u00e0 di Firenze. Graduate students may also take advantage of the resources of Casa Italiana, one of the most active Italian cultural centers in New York. Casa Italiana hosts colloquia, lectures, film series, concerts, and art exhibits throughout the year, as well as organizing, in conjunction with the Department of Italian Studies, the annual Zerilli-Marim\u00f2 Prize for Italian Fiction, awarded to the author of a new Italian novel.. In addition, two conference series are now hosted by the Department: an annual graduate spring conference and a biennial joint conference organized by the Department in conjunction with the Istituto Italiano di Scienze Umane (SUM), intended to bring together Italian and US scholars within the disciplines of history and literature.

In 2000 the Department of Italian Studies received a $500,000 gift   from Tiro a Segno Foundation to establish a Visiting Faculty Fellowship   in Italian-American Culture. The Tiro a Segno position is intended to be   multidisciplinary in its scope. The fellows are selected from a broad   array of disciplines and collaborate with various NYU departments and   scholars. The responsibilities of the Tiro a Segno visiting faculty   fellows include teaching both graduate and undergraduate courses on the   experience and contributions of Italian immigrants and Italian-Americans   to American culture and society. The content of the courses ranges from   sociology of immigration to anthropology of ethnic identity, to   Italian-American achievements in literature and in the visual and   performing arts. In addition, the visiting fellows present public   lectures in cooperation with NYU's Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim\u00f2.    The Tiro a Segno Foundation Visiting Faculty Fellowship in   Italian-American Culture was officially announced at Tiro a Segno's   112th Anniversary Banquet and Ball, held on November 3rd, 2000. Vito   Vincenti, chairman of the Foundation, said: \"One of the wonderful   advantages of this Fellowship is that, unlike the conventional endowment   of a university chair in a particular course of study to which a   specific professor is named until his or her death or retirement, this   Fellowship will vary both in the subject matter taught in alternate   years as well as in the professor who will guide the teaching and   study.\" Accepting the gift, professor Francesco Erspamer, then chair of   the Department of Italian Studies at NYU, said: \"The Italian-American   experience is an essential component of both Italian and American   history and culture, and should be an integral part of any program in   Italian Studies. It is most important that an institution such as NYU,   which is strongly connected to the Italian-American community of New   York through its location and tradition, takes the lead in this new and   promising field of study. Italian-American history, literature, cinema,   art, thinking, and values represent an incredibly rich asset. We are   extremely grateful to Tiro a Segno Foundation, not only because of their   donation but for their dedication in the promotion of culture.\"    Tiro a Segno was established in New York City on August 14, 1888.   Among its founders was Giuseppe Garibaldi. Since 1924, Tiro a Segno has   been located at 77 MacDougal Street. Consisting of some 400 members, the   organization is dedicated to the preservation of Italian heritage and   culture in the United States. During the year, Tiro a Segno offers a   regular schedule of social, cultural and sporting events.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

In 2000 the Department of Italian Studies received a $500,000 gift   from Tiro a Segno Foundation to establish a Visiting Faculty Fellowship   in Italian-American Culture. The Tiro a Segno position is intended to be   multidisciplinary in its scope. The fellows are selected from a broad   array of disciplines and collaborate with various NYU departments and   scholars. The responsibilities of the Tiro a Segno visiting faculty   fellows include teaching both graduate and undergraduate courses on the   experience and contributions of Italian immigrants and Italian-Americans   to American culture and society. The content of the courses ranges from   sociology of immigration to anthropology of ethnic identity, to   Italian-American achievements in literature and in the visual and   performing arts. In addition, the visiting fellows present public   lectures in cooperation with NYU's Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim\u00f2.    The Tiro a Segno Foundation Visiting Faculty Fellowship in   Italian-American Culture was officially announced at Tiro a Segno's   112th Anniversary Banquet and Ball, held on November 3rd, 2000. Vito   Vincenti, chairman of the Foundation, said: \"One of the wonderful   advantages of this Fellowship is that, unlike the conventional endowment   of a university chair in a particular course of study to which a   specific professor is named until his or her death or retirement, this   Fellowship will vary both in the subject matter taught in alternate   years as well as in the professor who will guide the teaching and   study.\" Accepting the gift, professor Francesco Erspamer, then chair of   the Department of Italian Studies at NYU, said: \"The Italian-American   experience is an essential component of both Italian and American   history and culture, and should be an integral part of any program in   Italian Studies. It is most important that an institution such as NYU,   which is strongly connected to the Italian-American community of New   York through its location and tradition, takes the lead in this new and   promising field of study. Italian-American history, literature, cinema,   art, thinking, and values represent an incredibly rich asset. We are   extremely grateful to Tiro a Segno Foundation, not only because of their   donation but for their dedication in the promotion of culture.\"    Tiro a Segno was established in New York City on August 14, 1888.   Among its founders was Giuseppe Garibaldi. Since 1924, Tiro a Segno has   been located at 77 MacDougal Street. Consisting of some 400 members, the   organization is dedicated to the preservation of Italian heritage and   culture in the United States. During the year, Tiro a Segno offers a   regular schedule of social, cultural and sporting events.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
