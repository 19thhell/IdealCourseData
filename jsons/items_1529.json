And how did journalists-those on the spot, and those who reflected on subsequent events-write about these events? This class is predicated on two ideas: that historical knowledge is necessary for any journalist (and any citizen); and that journalists-far from simply writing the \"first draft\" of history-have, throughout the last century, created works of lasting literary, moral, intellectual and historical resonance. This seminar will focus explicitly on extraordinary political events that made, and changed, the life of the past century, and that created the world we inhabit now. Throughout the term we will return to certain questions, including the changing nature of violence; the tension between nationalism and universalism; and the emergence of disputed concepts such as \"crimes against humanity.\" The events and situations we'll study we'll study include the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, World War II and the Holocaust, the Iranian Revolution, the Israel-Palestine conflict, the fall of the Soviet Union, the transition from apartheid in South Africa, the military dictatorships of Latin America, the war in Bosnia, and the crisis in Iraq. CRC students will be given priority; open to others after CRC enrollment with permission of the instructor.                                               Arthur L.
