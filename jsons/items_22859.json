Over the course of an academic year, students in Capstone work in teams with faculty oversight to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question.\u00a0   Capstone projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills such as project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. For students, it's an opportunity to interweave their learning in all these areas and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment; for organizations, it's a chance to have current and future public service leaders\u00a0focused on their success.

My organization asked the students to come up with innovative solutions and alternative interventions to specific identified issues. I was able to take the students into the field and show them some of our work and how the project could complement the organization's ongoing work. The students that chose our project are really talented and thoughtful, and I am excited to see their research fully actualized.

The Capstone Team was phenomenal. They presented their final work to our agency's Senior Management, and we were blown away. We have been trying to do this project for years, and the students were able to facilitate the process in a few months.

And now, as a Capstone client with Malaria No More, I am able to see firsthand the tremendous impact of the students\u2019 work. Wagner students recently completed a research study in Cameroon investigating the knowledge and practices of fever treatment, which we are using to inform our malaria education and communication efforts in the country. The students\u2019 dedication to the project not only made for a good working experience, but also ensured the quality of their work.

The project offers you the chance to work with a startup company or nonprofit organization and propose a solution to a real business need. Each year, the program partners with nonprofit organizations to design student projects that not only advance your business acumen and technological skills, but also further your commitment to social responsibility. Examples of recent student projects include:     The development and implementation of a customer service component for an online retailer   The implementation of a project management program office   The development and implementation of medical records digitization and retrieval system   The design and implementation of a management dashboard for a real estate development firm   The application of traditional business practices to small nonprofits               The Thesis Project   You may elect to work on a thesis research project in lieu of the applied project. The thesis provides an opportunity to make a unique contribution to the body of knowledge in a subject area studied in the M.S. in Management and Systems program. Working under the mentorship of a faculty supervisor, students select a topic; develop a research model; conduct research and analysis; and write a significant thesis paper to be reviewed by experts in the field.

Over the course of an academic year, students in Capstone work in teams with faculty oversight to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question.\u00a0   Capstone projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills such as project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. For students, it's an opportunity to interweave their learning in all these areas and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment; for organizations, it's a chance to have current and future public service leaders\u00a0focused on their success.

My organization asked the students to come up with innovative solutions and alternative interventions to specific identified issues. I was able to take the students into the field and show them some of our work and how the project could complement the organization's ongoing work. The students that chose our project are really talented and thoughtful, and I am excited to see their research fully actualized.

Working under the mentorship of a faculty supervisor, students select a topic; develop a research model; conduct research and analysis; and write a significant thesis paper to be reviewed by experts in the field.

will produce a Capstone Project, which may be either an individual or team project. Students do a Capstone Project in their major field. The Capstone Project is a demanding, year-long endeavor aiming at a significant piece of research or creative work\u2014an historical narrative, musical composition, performance, invention, documented experiment, scholarly thesis, or other form appropriate to the student\u2019s goals. Unlike other courses in which faculty establish the structure and set assignments, the Capstone Project puts the student in charge. The fundamental challenge is to enter unmapped terrain and to extend oneself in making knowledge, reframing conventional approaches to an issue or creating something new.     No matter what form the Capstone takes, each student will have a faculty mentor and participate in a Capstone seminar that serves as a forum to discuss the research process and present work in progress. These seminars offer a model of intellectual community and collaborative learning in which participants offer their thoughts across fields of study and engage in active critique and revision. At the end of the school year, the students will present their Capstone work at a university-wide celebration of their creative achievements.
