Its heart is in Greenwich Village around Washington Square Park, but with institutes and centers on the Upper East Side, academic buildings and dorms down on Wall Street, and NYU-Poly in downtown Brooklyn, getting from place to place at NYU requires a little assistance.        Luckily, there are a lot of options available to get around New York City. University Transportation services run between the Washington Square campus and NYU residence halls.   The MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) runs the subway, train and bus systems that will get you where you need to go.   If all else fails and you're in the Village, head over to Broadway to catch a cab downtown (yellow cabs only, please) or over to Sixth Avenue to catch one going uptown.
