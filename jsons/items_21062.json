Semester: Fall       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           The last three decades have witnessed a global proliferation of public sector restructuring, decentralization, and democratization in developing countries. Traditional development planning has adapted (unevenly) to these trends as they have unfolded. This course presents an overview of the evolution of the theory and practice of planning in developing countries with a particular focus on subnational governments. A central theme is that there are certain universal norms and processes in development planning, but the structure and performance of a planning system depend heavily on the economic, political, institutional and cultural context of a particular country. The course outlines and assesses planning models and systems, reviews approaches used by developing countries and international development agencies to support decentralization and local planning, and introduces a range of practices and tools used by local planners in developing countries. The overall focus is on how local planning systems, techniques and processes can be strategically designed and implemented to work effectively in different contexts. Detailed case studies and exercises based on them are an integral part of the course.

NYU School of Law and Concurrences Competition Law Journal Conference  Friday, October 24, 2014  8:00-6:30pm  40 Washington Square South, Greenberg Lounge   CONFERENCE REPORT   Abstract: Rapidly emerging economies such as China, India, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa are taking center stage in antitrust enforcement. Multinational firms must have regard to the competition systems of these and other developing nations when engaging in merger activity, collaborating with competitors, and pricing, distributing, and licensing their products. Competition authorities in countries at different stages of development are trying to meet the daunting challenges posed by public and private power, cronyism and privilege, and are trying to make their markets work for the good of their peoples. This program will address the coming of age of developing countries\u2019 competition law systems, and what this means in law, policy and on-the-ground reality for entrepreneurs, consumers, \u201cthe people,\u201d and the world.
