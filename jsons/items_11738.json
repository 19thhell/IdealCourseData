A planning committee of faculty and graduate students initiates programsponsored workshops, conferences, and faculty and graduate student lecture series and coordinates the scheduling of courses in the area.    For the second field in comparative women\u2019s history at the doctoral level, students are expected to take three courses in areas other than the major field. The history of women and gender can satisfy the departmental requirement for the doctoral second field if courses are comparative or in a field outside the major or in some combination thereof.

PUBLIC HISTORY    The program in public history provides Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy candidates with the opportunity to prepare for careers as historians in public and private institutions outside academia, where historical perspectives address areas as diverse as public policy, museum programs, and historical dramatizations for media. The program offers students three areas of historical work: media history, local and community history, and history and public policy.    All entering students enroll in a sequential two-semester seminar in public history that introduces students to literature and problems in the various public history arenas. Students complete a major research essay and then translate that research into a public history format for a public audience.    The concentration in public history is open to all qualified M.A. and Ph.D. students. It consists of the introductory sequence; a course in one of the three tracks; a methodological course in either oral history or quantitative methods ( G57.2012 or G57.2019), and four electives in the department, of which one should be a research seminar. Public history can satisfy the departmental requirement for a secondary field. For Americanists, the courses must be comparative or in another field or in some combination thereof.    M.A. students may elect instead to complete a 44-point program leading to a New York State Board of Regents Certificate in Public History. In addition to requiring all the courses in the concentration, the certificate program requires students to take the two remaining introductory track courses and Literature of the Field: America to 1865 ( G57.1600). Finally, all public history students should complement class work with internships in various participating agencies in theNew York metropolitan area.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program. Inquiries should be addressed to Professor Paul Mattingly, Director, Program in Public History, Department of History, Faculty of Arts and Science, New York University, 19 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4556.

ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT AND HISTORICAL EDITING    The program in archival management and historical editing offers students the opportunity to combine either a Master of Arts or a Ph.D. degree in history with an Advanced Certificate in Archival Management and Historical Editing. The certificate program is also open to students with an M.A. or a Ph.D. degree in another appropriate social science- or humanities-based discipline. Ph.D. candidates in history may also elect to use the archives program as a second field, and Ph.D. students wishing to complete the entire program may apply 12 of the 20 required points toward their Ph.D. requirements.    Since 1977, this program has trained graduate history students for careers as archivists, historical editors, administrators, and manuscript curators. The program provides students with a solid foundation in the theory, methodology, and practice of archives. It also emphasizes the broad humanistic training in history necessary for archivists to develop a vision for their work. Course work in complementary disciplines and new technologies is stressed, ensuring that program graduates remain current with professional trends and developments. New York City offers a unique setting and laboratory for students exploring history and archives, and the program takes full advantage of the city\u2019s repositories in providing internships and practicum experiences for its students. Program graduates work as archivists in a wide variety of academic, nonprofit, corporate, and governmental venues. The program\u2019s unique historical editing component also trains historians for alternative careers in preserving and disseminating historical documents in book, microform, CD-ROM, and electronic formats.    All entering students enroll in a sequential, two-semester colloquium ( G57.1010 and G57.2010) that offers a broad overview of the field and combines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in an archival setting. Over the course of two semesters, students complete a major research paper on an appropriate archival topic and arrange and describe two archival collections in conjunction with their practicum. Students are also required to take a course in historical editing, which focuses on the location, arrangement, and publication of documents. As part of this course, students undertake research to identify and annotate their documentary collection.    M.A. students enroll in a 44-point program of study, leading to the Master of Arts degree in history and to the certificate. Requirements for the M.A. degree and the advanced certificate are 24 points in history (which must include an M.A. seminar) and 20 points in archives. Students are required to complete 12 points in the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010. Students successfully completing the program must have 16 points with a grade of B or better. Students with more than 4 points below B are not eligible for the certificate and may not register for additional courses.    Students holding an appropriate master\u2019s degree in a social science or humanities discipline may be accepted into the program on a nondegree, certificate- only basis. Such students are permitted to register for 20 points in archives to complete the requirements. Ph.D. students in history wishing to use archives as a second field are required to complete the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010.    Through a consortium arrangement with Long Island University\u2019s Palmer School of Library and Information Science, students are also able to enroll in more library-oriented courses offered at Bobst Library and to apply these credits toward their certificate. Students should check with the director for a complete list ofPalmerSchool offerings.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program.

JOINT AND DUAL DEGREE PROGRAMS    Joint degree programs at the doctoral level are available with theInstitute ofFrench Studies, the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, and the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. A dual degree M.A.- J.D. program is available with theSchool ofLaw, although students admitted into this program are expected to earn the doctorate in history. Admission to these joint and dual degree programs must be granted by both departments or institutes or programs or schools upon entry or at the point of screening. Students in these programs normally are expected to complete the \u201cliterature of the field\u201d courses and take the history department\u2019s qualifying examination and a major field examination that may bridge the two disciplines. Joint and dual degree candidates are exempt from the departmental requirement for a second field. SPECIAL PROJECTS    The Margaret Sanger Papers Project collects, assembles, and publishes records documenting the life and career of the founder of the American birth control movement. Located in the department since 1987, the Sanger Papers Project microfilmed the Smith College Collections Series, consisting of almost 45,000 documents; in 1995 an additional 9,000 documents gathered in an international search were microfilmed as the Collected Documents Series. Both microfilmed series are being published by University Publications of America, along with a reel guide and index. The project is preparing an electronic edition of the microfilmed documents for distribution on CD-ROM or via the Internet. The project will then work on a four-volume book edition of selected Sanger letters. The project employs graduate assistants and other students. Documents from the Sanger Papers collection are available for student and faculty research and serve as practical examples for the course on historical editing.    For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor of the Margaret Sanger Papers.    The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and translating the entire extant public and private correspondence of earlyNew York governor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) for publication in microfilm and annotated book editions. Considered by some colonial historians as the \u201cFather of American Democracy\u201d and best known for the 1689New York uprising that bears his name, Leisler played a prominent role in the economic and social development of colonial New York and earlyAmerica. Housed in the department since 1988, the Leisler Papers collection contains over 3,000 documents in Dutch, French, German, and English that provide a wealth of information on the Atlantic world in the early modern era. The project employs graduate and other students to assist in making the collection available to scholars and the public.

PUBLIC HISTORY    The program in public history provides Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy candidates with the opportunity to prepare for careers as historians in public and private institutions outside academia, where historical perspectives address areas as diverse as public policy, museum programs, and historical dramatizations for media. The program offers students three areas of historical work: media history, local and community history, and history and public policy.    All entering students enroll in a sequential two-semester seminar in public history that introduces students to literature and problems in the various public history arenas. Students complete a major research essay and then translate that research into a public history format for a public audience.    The concentration in public history is open to all qualified M.A. and Ph.D. students. It consists of the introductory sequence; a course in one of the three tracks; a methodological course in either oral history or quantitative methods ( G57.2012 or G57.2019), and four electives in the department, of which one should be a research seminar. Public history can satisfy the departmental requirement for a secondary field. For Americanists, the courses must be comparative or in another field or in some combination thereof.    M.A. students may elect instead to complete a 44-point program leading to a New York State Board of Regents Certificate in Public History. In addition to requiring all the courses in the concentration, the certificate program requires students to take the two remaining introductory track courses and Literature of the Field: America to 1865 ( G57.1600). Finally, all public history students should complement class work with internships in various participating agencies in theNew York metropolitan area.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program. Inquiries should be addressed to Professor Paul Mattingly, Director, Program in Public History, Department of History, Faculty of Arts and Science, New York University, 19 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4556.

ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT AND HISTORICAL EDITING    The program in archival management and historical editing offers students the opportunity to combine either a Master of Arts or a Ph.D. degree in history with an Advanced Certificate in Archival Management and Historical Editing. The certificate program is also open to students with an M.A. or a Ph.D. degree in another appropriate social science- or humanities-based discipline. Ph.D. candidates in history may also elect to use the archives program as a second field, and Ph.D. students wishing to complete the entire program may apply 12 of the 20 required points toward their Ph.D. requirements.    Since 1977, this program has trained graduate history students for careers as archivists, historical editors, administrators, and manuscript curators. The program provides students with a solid foundation in the theory, methodology, and practice of archives. It also emphasizes the broad humanistic training in history necessary for archivists to develop a vision for their work. Course work in complementary disciplines and new technologies is stressed, ensuring that program graduates remain current with professional trends and developments. New York City offers a unique setting and laboratory for students exploring history and archives, and the program takes full advantage of the city\u2019s repositories in providing internships and practicum experiences for its students. Program graduates work as archivists in a wide variety of academic, nonprofit, corporate, and governmental venues. The program\u2019s unique historical editing component also trains historians for alternative careers in preserving and disseminating historical documents in book, microform, CD-ROM, and electronic formats.    All entering students enroll in a sequential, two-semester colloquium ( G57.1010 and G57.2010) that offers a broad overview of the field and combines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in an archival setting. Over the course of two semesters, students complete a major research paper on an appropriate archival topic and arrange and describe two archival collections in conjunction with their practicum. Students are also required to take a course in historical editing, which focuses on the location, arrangement, and publication of documents. As part of this course, students undertake research to identify and annotate their documentary collection.    M.A. students enroll in a 44-point program of study, leading to the Master of Arts degree in history and to the certificate. Requirements for the M.A. degree and the advanced certificate are 24 points in history (which must include an M.A. seminar) and 20 points in archives. Students are required to complete 12 points in the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010. Students successfully completing the program must have 16 points with a grade of B or better. Students with more than 4 points below B are not eligible for the certificate and may not register for additional courses.    Students holding an appropriate master\u2019s degree in a social science or humanities discipline may be accepted into the program on a nondegree, certificate- only basis. Such students are permitted to register for 20 points in archives to complete the requirements. Ph.D. students in history wishing to use archives as a second field are required to complete the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010.    Through a consortium arrangement with Long Island University\u2019s Palmer School of Library and Information Science, students are also able to enroll in more library-oriented courses offered at Bobst Library and to apply these credits toward their certificate. Students should check with the director for a complete list ofPalmerSchool offerings.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program.

SPECIAL PROJECTS    The Margaret Sanger Papers Project collects, assembles, and publishes records documenting the life and career of the founder of the American birth control movement. Located in the department since 1987, the Sanger Papers Project microfilmed the Smith College Collections Series, consisting of almost 45,000 documents; in 1995 an additional 9,000 documents gathered in an international search were microfilmed as the Collected Documents Series. Both microfilmed series are being published by University Publications of America, along with a reel guide and index. The project is preparing an electronic edition of the microfilmed documents for distribution on CD-ROM or via the Internet. The project will then work on a four-volume book edition of selected Sanger letters. The project employs graduate assistants and other students. Documents from the Sanger Papers collection are available for student and faculty research and serve as practical examples for the course on historical editing.    For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor of the Margaret Sanger Papers.    The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and translating the entire extant public and private correspondence of earlyNew York governor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) for publication in microfilm and annotated book editions. Considered by some colonial historians as the \u201cFather of American Democracy\u201d and best known for the 1689New York uprising that bears his name, Leisler played a prominent role in the economic and social development of colonial New York and earlyAmerica. Housed in the department since 1988, the Leisler Papers collection contains over 3,000 documents in Dutch, French, German, and English that provide a wealth of information on the Atlantic world in the early modern era. The project employs graduate and other students to assist in making the collection available to scholars and the public.
