Are they indeed anchored in the sexual dynamics of the human family as argued by Freud, or are they a necessary stage in humanity\u2019s cultural formation as suggested by Girard et al (Violent Origins)? Moreover, how do biblical gender/sexual roles and the implementation of violence within them differ from those of the analogous Greco-Christian tradition and its 20th-century heir \u2013 Freudian psychoanalysis? What are the psychological and ethical implications of the differences between the biblical account of the first homicidal act (Cain and Able) and the classical Greek take on homicide in The Orestea or Oedipus Rex? These are some of the questions to be discussed in this class through a comparative close reading of selected biblical narratives and Greek myth and drama, accompanied by relevant assignments from biblical, classical Greek, and psychoanalytic scholarship; literary and feminist interpretation of the Bible; and artistic representations of biblical and classic Greek themes. The Dead Sea Scrolls, Judaism, and Christianity (HBRJD-UA 131) [Ancient/Rabbinic] Instructor: Prof. Alex Jassen Day &amp; Time: Thursday 12:30pm - 1:45pm Description: Survey of the importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls for the history of early Judaism and Christianity.

Conceptions of Gender in Ancient Egypt (HBRJD-UA 138 ) [Ancient/Rabbinic] Instructor: Prof. Ann Roth Day &amp; Time: Thursday 12:30pm - 1:45pm Description: The pharaonic Egyptian culture (3100 \u2013 30 BCE) was situated geographically in an unusual agriculture zone, dependent not upon rain and irrigation, but on an annual flood that left the land fertilized and well-watered. As a result, general conceptions of fertility, and hence gender, were somewhat anomalous. This course will deal with this hypothesis, and the traditional scholarship on Egyptian gender relations and sexuality, by examining archaeological remains, artistic representations, and texts throughout the pharaonic period. Russian Jewish History (HBRJD-UA 191) [Modern] Instructor: Prof. Gennady Estraikh Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm Description: Focuses on Jewish history in imperial Russia, from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 20th. It also gives an overview of the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. Topics include the government's policies toward Jews; attempts to integrate them into the larger society; the establishment and development of Russian Jewish civil society; Jewish participation in the revolutionary movement; aspects of Jewish social, economic, and cultural life in villages, town, and cities; the role of women in family and communal life; military service; anti-Jewish violence; and emigration. Israeli Politics and Society (HBRJD-UA 710) [Modern] Instructor: TBA Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 3:30pm \u2013 4:45 pm Description: Examines the power structure and mechanisms of contemporary Israeli politics beginning with the emergence of the provisional government in 1948. Traces how Israel's national institutions, key basic bills and the legislation mechanism, and electoral system developed. The course also examines key fault lines in Israeli social, political, and economic life, including Jewish-Arab relations; the balance between the welfare state and economic liberalism; Union workers and gender relations. Readings in Talmud: Hullin VIII (in Hebrew) (HBRJD-UA 784) Instructor: Prof. Lawrence Schiffman Day &amp; Time: Tuesday 6:30pm \u2013 8:00pm Description: Studies a selected section of the Hebrew and Aramaic text of the Babylonian Talmud, utilizing both traditional and academic methods of study.\u200e Emphasis is on mastering the themes and concepts while studying the text and its commentaries in depth. CORE Courses  Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Reformation (CORE-UA 400-070) Instructor: Prof. Mark Smith Day &amp; Time: Tuesday, Thursday 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm Description: Often viewed as a series of \"Protestant\" responses to the Roman Catholic   Church, the Reformation was a period of massive religious and political   conflict. It appropriated the Bible as the single basis of   authoritative knowledge and also transformed the study of the Bible   based on the language and textual scholarship that had emerged in the   wake of the Renaissance\u2019s rediscovery of classical texts. In taking up   the Bible as well as classical learning, the Reformation posed   fundamental questions about the nature of individual persons, society,   and humanity. These issues continue to inform fundamental ideas and   conceptual categories of religion and society in Western Europe and the   United States today. Ancient Israel (CORE-UA 514-001) Instructor: Prof. Daniel Fleming Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Description: The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 BCE to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century BCE. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel (CORE-UA 537-001) Instructor: Prof. Ronald Zweig Day &amp; Time: Monday, Wednesday 2:00pm \u2013 3:15pm Description: Explores the cultural values and expressions through which residents of the modern State of Israel have tried to come to grips with the manifold challenges their country has faced since its inception in 1948. Its founders envisioned citizens would initiate extensive changes in their economic and political behavior, family life, attitudes toward their bodies, relations with their neighbors, religious outlook, and view of their place in the world, and expected that these would find concrete expression in literature, art, music, architecture, and intellectual life. But they did not anticipate the challenges of rapid mass immigration, periodic wars, shifting geopolitical alignments, transformation of the global economy, and sweeping technological innovations. We analyze these far-reaching changes in the context in which Israeli culture has functioned and investigate how that culture has responded to them, drawing on journalistic accounts, short stories, and Israeli films and television programs.

Prerequisites: junior or senior status, Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1), and at least two other religious studies courses, or permission of the instructor. 4 points. Complements and develops the methodological and theoretical emphasis encountered in Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, albeit with a higher level of specificity and sophistication. The focus is on a specific thematic motif with cross-cultural applicability (for example, ritual, the body, sacrifice, religion and the state). Students can explore the import of the motif in question for their own area of specialization, as well as examine its manifestations in other traditions. Students are expected to make formal presentations to the class. Rooted at the foundation of modern liberalism, toleration of religion seems an obvious ideal, codified in democratic laws and norms. Yet religious intolerance persists through continued encounters with difference in increasingly diverse, globally connected societies. Against such a background of presumption and persistence, this seminar asks how notions of tolerance and intolerance have developed in relation to constructions of religion and society, and how their relations have changed over time. In various historical and cultural contexts, students will examine such questions as: How did tolerance emerge as a basic principle of liberalism? Is toleration a religious or a secular concept? Are religious and secular notions of tolerance and intolerance intrinsically compatible, or do they comprise essentially different forms? The first half of the course traces historical sources of ideas about religious toleration, emphasizing Reformation, Renaissance, and Enlightenment documents. Turning to our contemporary period, the second half of the course explores recent studies of law, sexuality, political theory, and sociology in relation to religious toleration. Modern Jewish Philosophy RELST-UA.106 Wolfson. 4 points . Explores seminal debates about Judaism and Jewishness from the 18th century to today. Topics to be discussed include the existence of God, the authority of Jewish law, and Jewish chosenness.

The course concentrates on the period from the exodus and conquest of the Land of Israel through the Babylonian exile.    Introduction to the New Testament RELST-UA 302 Kocar. 4 points. Introduces students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament, as well as other important early Christian documents. Students are given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament text in a lecture hall setting where the professor provides historical context and focuses on significant issues, describes modern scholarly methodologies, and places the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion.    Religions of India RELST-UA 337 Burchett. 4 points. Introduces students to the vibrant religious traditions of South Asia. Examines Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, Jain, and Sikh traditions, as well as the ancient and modern contexts in which they are situated. Students focus on the ways that various problems (material, intellectual, political) have served as catalysts for the formation and dissolution of communities of interpretation and practice and reexamine the multiple pasts of South Asia without projecting modern categories onto those traditions. Classical Mythology RELST-UA 404 Meineche. 4 points. This course discusses the myths and legends of Greek mythology and the gods, demigods, heroes, nymphs, monsters, and everyday mortals who played out their parts in this mythology.

Roman myth is also treated, with emphasis on Aeneas and the foundation legends of Rome. This course is sponsored by the Department of Classics .    Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. History of Judaism: Emergence of Classical Judaism RELST-UA.680 Jassen. 4 points History of Judaism during its formative periods.

We will go on to the Inquisition: from the repression of Catholicism to the attack of the \"sect of Diana,\" the bull \"Magnis desiderantes\" (1484) and the Malleus maleficarum (1486). The foundations of the witch hunt of the 16th Century will be explored, as well as the exercise of political virtues and the divine mission of the individual. We will conclude with the decadence of religious life and of civic liberties in the second half of the century. Conducted in English.    Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe - RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points Prague    Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.    This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.    Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.

Religion, Politics and the State in Comparative Perspective - RELST-UA 9613 - 4 points Tel Aviv    The purpose of this course is to examine the relation between religion and public life in both western and non western societies. Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes."}]}]
