The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit. Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge. Read more...          Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being. All students interested in participating in a toolkit workshop should call (212) 998-4780 for further information and registration. Read more...           Relaxation Oasis     The Relaxation Oasis is a tool to help integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the SHC promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. We emphasize a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions. Read more...          Consults for Study Abroad     Many NYU students study abroad. Health and mental health services vary from country to country. Consults are recommended to clarify counseling and medication services that might be available abroad. Read more...

The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit. Counseling and Wellness Services at SHC has always offered free short-term counseling (talk therapy) to NYU students; these services remain free of charge. Read more...          Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments. Talking to other students who have had similar experiences provides support and perspective. A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...          Toolkits     Toolkits are two-part workshops designed to help students develop and practice new skills to enhance personal, academic and social well-being. All students interested in participating in a toolkit workshop should call (212) 998-4780 for further information and registration. Read more...           Relaxation Oasis     The Relaxation Oasis is a tool to help integrate the instruction and practice of mindfulness into the services provided through the SHC promoting compassion, well-being, and academic success. We emphasize a non-sectarian approach to mindfulness, drawing on the contemplative practices of a variety of traditions. Read more...          Consults for Study Abroad     Many NYU students study abroad. Health and mental health services vary from country to country. Consults are recommended to clarify counseling and medication services that might be available abroad. Read more...
