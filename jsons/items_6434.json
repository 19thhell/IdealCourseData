Course ID: JOUR-UA-505.001 (4 credits, no prerequisites)     Instructor(s): Carol Sternhell     Syllabus: Download PDF     Description           To\u00a0what extent are we our bodies? Do we inhabit them, flee them, celebrate them,\u00a0transcend them? How do others \u201cread\u201d our bodies? Are we accepted by our culture \u2026 admired \u2026 despised? Writing the Body is a course for everyone with a body \u2013 a\u00a0male body, a female body, a body of uncertain gender.   We will read a wide\u00a0variety of individual body-centered accounts (What is it like to be a\u00a0quadriplegic and only be able to move your mouth? What is it like to be very\u00a0fat?) and cultural analyses (If egg and sperm both move to meet in the\u00a0Fallopian tube, who decided to call the sperm active and the egg passive? Is\u00a0plastic surgery barbaric or empowering?) Topics discussed will include \u2013 but\u00a0not be limited to \u2013 beauty, weight, sex, rape, menstruation, abortion, penis\u00a0size, transgender identity, body modification (tattoos, piercing and beyond),\u00a0disability, and race. In addition to extensive reading and discussion, students\u00a0will write several versions of their own stories of embodiment.\u00a0                                                  Arthur L.

Do we inhabit them, flee them, celebrate them,\u00a0transcend them? How do others \u201cread\u201d our bodies? Are we accepted by our culture \u2026 admired \u2026 despised? Writing the Body is a course for everyone with a body \u2013 a\u00a0male body, a female body, a body of uncertain gender.   We will read a wide\u00a0variety of individual body-centered accounts (What is it like to be a\u00a0quadriplegic and only be able to move your mouth? What is it like to be very\u00a0fat?) and cultural analyses (If egg and sperm both move to meet in the\u00a0Fallopian tube, who decided to call the sperm active and the egg passive? Is\u00a0plastic surgery barbaric or empowering?) Topics discussed will include \u2013 but\u00a0not be limited to \u2013 beauty, weight, sex, rape, menstruation, abortion, penis\u00a0size, transgender identity, body modification (tattoos, piercing and beyond),\u00a0disability, and race. In addition to extensive reading and discussion, students\u00a0will write several versions of their own stories of embodiment.\u00a0                                                  Arthur L.

Do we inhabit them, flee them, celebrate them,\u00a0transcend them? How do others \u201cread\u201d our bodies? Are we accepted by our culture \u2026 admired \u2026 despised? Writing the Body is a course for everyone with a body \u2013 a\u00a0male body, a female body, a body of uncertain gender.   We will read a wide\u00a0variety of individual body-centered accounts (What is it like to be a\u00a0quadriplegic and only be able to move your mouth? What is it like to be very\u00a0fat?) and cultural analyses (If egg and sperm both move to meet in the\u00a0Fallopian tube, who decided to call the sperm active and the egg passive? Is\u00a0plastic surgery barbaric or empowering?) Topics discussed will include \u2013 but\u00a0not be limited to \u2013 beauty, weight, sex, rape, menstruation, abortion, penis\u00a0size, transgender identity, body modification (tattoos, piercing and beyond),\u00a0disability, and race. In addition to extensive reading and discussion, students\u00a0will write several versions of their own stories of embodiment.\u00a0                                                  Arthur L.
