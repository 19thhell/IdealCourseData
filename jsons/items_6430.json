The course begins with visual storytelling and then expands to different storytelling techniques for different kinds of topics, from traditional news reporting to the cinema verite style. By covering neighborhoods in New York, students learn to develop story ideas, conduct interviews and structure a story. Detailed script analysis is combined with in-depth discussions of student work. This course also includes viewing assignments based on understanding the historical development of the form. Students work in teams of two.   GRADUATE TV REPORTING II - G54.1172 Prerequisite : G54.1040 (required) This intermediate second semester course builds on the storytelling skills learned the first semester by doing a combination of magazine, short investigative and enterprise stories pieces as well as assignments aimed at preparing them for long form documentary work. Students also learn how to write a proposal and treatment for their half-hour documentary project.   GRADUATE ADVANCED TV REPORTING - G54.1175 Prerequisite : G54.1040 and G54.1172 (required) This class is unique to our news and documentary curriculum. The focus of the course is on developing an interesting in-depth story that will have a complex story structure and style. The emphasis is on understanding process, from research skills to the final edit of a documentary length story. Students work on advanced interviewing techniques and more complex methods of gathering audio and video, effective writing to pictures. The goal is that students understand how style can enhance the meaning of the story. Research and primary shooting occurs over the summer with the equipment support from the department.   The professor works closely with the students in and out of class with attention to every detail of the production process. This means the student learns how to pitch a story and present it during the various stages of production. This one on one contact is an essential part of the learning process and distinct to our program.   WRR I: NEWS &amp; DOCUMENTARY - G54.1021.009 The best journalism flows from logical thinking, solid research, and comprehensive journalism. Through short deadline pieces and longer writing assignments this class will simulate a newsroom and teach you how to think like a journalist. New York City will be your reporting lab and you will be sent out into the city hunting for stories from day one. While the primary focus of this class is print, the skills will give you a strong journalism foundation that can be used in any media.   PRESS ETHICS - G54.0012.002 This course offers through the case method a critical examination of current and recurring ethical and legal issues in journalism. Areas covered include reporting practices, roles of editors and executives, conflict of interest, sources, defamation and privacy, criminal justice and national security.   POLITICAL CINEMA - G54.1182.11 In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do journalists and filmmakers fight against (or, alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? This class will focus primarily (though not exclusively) on one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East--though it will also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and the United States. Through journalistic readings and film screenings, we will explore how \"the other\" is constructed: politically, aesthetically, ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Mideast; the journalism of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them; filmmaking; and film criticism.   TV NEWSCAST: THE DIGITAL NEWSROOM- G54.1070 (Open to all graduate journalism students) Students learn broadcast writing skills in a real time situation by producing a live broadcast that goes out over the NYU cable to the dorms and public buildings. The emphasis of the class is on developing news judgment under tight deadline pressures. The students in the class perform all the editorial and technical roles on the newscast and report stories as well. We have national and international video footage from the CNN Pathfire news service and we have the AP ENPS news system that provides wires and software for formatting the newscast. Interview skills are developed during the newscast with in-depth newsmaker interviews. Positions are rotated to give students a sense of the different roles in a newsroom and the importance of teamwork.   LONG FORM VIDEO EDITING - GA1182.07 The class will explore the complexity of long form visualization and the various structural options possible through editing.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but the different ways of telling them.\u00a0 Through various exercises the students will experiment with various approaches and editing styles.\u00a0 Simultaneous with this class, students will be working on their own documentaries in Advanced TV Reporting.\u00a0 Whereas that class is more focused on concept and structure, the editing class will look closely at specific editing choices and techniques.   VISUAL THINKING- G54.1148 The class explores the complexity of documentary visualization through cinematography.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but also how we might inspire new ways of telling them visually.\u00a0 This class will immerse the students in the challenges of different approaches and shooting styles through production exercises and through significant documentary examples.   The students' work has won many awards from the Academy of TV Arts and Science Student Awards, the Christopher Awards and American Women in Radio and Television and appeared in many prestigious film festivals. They have also received travel grants from the National Television Academy Foundation and the Student Academy Awards.

The course begins with visual storytelling and then expands to different storytelling techniques for different kinds of topics, from traditional news reporting to the cinema verite style. By covering neighborhoods in New York, students learn to develop story ideas, conduct interviews and structure a story. Detailed script analysis is combined with in-depth discussions of student work. This course also includes viewing assignments based on understanding the historical development of the form. Students work in teams of two.   GRADUATE TV REPORTING II - G54.1172 Prerequisite : G54.1040 (required) This intermediate second semester course builds on the storytelling skills learned the first semester by doing a combination of magazine, short investigative and enterprise stories pieces as well as assignments aimed at preparing them for long form documentary work. Students also learn how to write a proposal and treatment for their half-hour documentary project.   GRADUATE ADVANCED TV REPORTING - G54.1175 Prerequisite : G54.1040 and G54.1172 (required) This class is unique to our news and documentary curriculum. The focus of the course is on developing an interesting in-depth story that will have a complex story structure and style. The emphasis is on understanding process, from research skills to the final edit of a documentary length story. Students work on advanced interviewing techniques and more complex methods of gathering audio and video, effective writing to pictures. The goal is that students understand how style can enhance the meaning of the story. Research and primary shooting occurs over the summer with the equipment support from the department.   The professor works closely with the students in and out of class with attention to every detail of the production process. This means the student learns how to pitch a story and present it during the various stages of production. This one on one contact is an essential part of the learning process and distinct to our program.   WRR I: NEWS &amp; DOCUMENTARY - G54.1021.009 The best journalism flows from logical thinking, solid research, and comprehensive journalism. Through short deadline pieces and longer writing assignments this class will simulate a newsroom and teach you how to think like a journalist. New York City will be your reporting lab and you will be sent out into the city hunting for stories from day one. While the primary focus of this class is print, the skills will give you a strong journalism foundation that can be used in any media.   PRESS ETHICS - G54.0012.002 This course offers through the case method a critical examination of current and recurring ethical and legal issues in journalism. Areas covered include reporting practices, roles of editors and executives, conflict of interest, sources, defamation and privacy, criminal justice and national security.   POLITICAL CINEMA - G54.1182.11 In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do journalists and filmmakers fight against (or, alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? This class will focus primarily (though not exclusively) on one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East--though it will also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and the United States. Through journalistic readings and film screenings, we will explore how \"the other\" is constructed: politically, aesthetically, ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Mideast; the journalism of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them; filmmaking; and film criticism.   TV NEWSCAST: THE DIGITAL NEWSROOM- G54.1070 (Open to all graduate journalism students) Students learn broadcast writing skills in a real time situation by producing a live broadcast that goes out over the NYU cable to the dorms and public buildings. The emphasis of the class is on developing news judgment under tight deadline pressures. The students in the class perform all the editorial and technical roles on the newscast and report stories as well. We have national and international video footage from the CNN Pathfire news service and we have the AP ENPS news system that provides wires and software for formatting the newscast. Interview skills are developed during the newscast with in-depth newsmaker interviews. Positions are rotated to give students a sense of the different roles in a newsroom and the importance of teamwork.   LONG FORM VIDEO EDITING - GA1182.07 The class will explore the complexity of long form visualization and the various structural options possible through editing.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but the different ways of telling them.\u00a0 Through various exercises the students will experiment with various approaches and editing styles.\u00a0 Simultaneous with this class, students will be working on their own documentaries in Advanced TV Reporting.\u00a0 Whereas that class is more focused on concept and structure, the editing class will look closely at specific editing choices and techniques.   VISUAL THINKING- G54.1148 The class explores the complexity of documentary visualization through cinematography.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but also how we might inspire new ways of telling them visually.\u00a0 This class will immerse the students in the challenges of different approaches and shooting styles through production exercises and through significant documentary examples.   The students' work has won many awards from the Academy of TV Arts and Science Student Awards, the Christopher Awards and American Women in Radio and Television and appeared in many prestigious film festivals. They have also received travel grants from the National Television Academy Foundation and the Student Academy Awards.

The course begins with visual storytelling and then expands to different storytelling techniques for different kinds of topics, from traditional news reporting to the cinema verite style. By covering neighborhoods in New York, students learn to develop story ideas, conduct interviews and structure a story. Detailed script analysis is combined with in-depth discussions of student work. This course also includes viewing assignments based on understanding the historical development of the form. Students work in teams of two.   GRADUATE TV REPORTING II - G54.1172 Prerequisite : G54.1040 (required) This intermediate second semester course builds on the storytelling skills learned the first semester by doing a combination of magazine, short investigative and enterprise stories pieces as well as assignments aimed at preparing them for long form documentary work. Students also learn how to write a proposal and treatment for their half-hour documentary project.   GRADUATE ADVANCED TV REPORTING - G54.1175 Prerequisite : G54.1040 and G54.1172 (required) This class is unique to our news and documentary curriculum. The focus of the course is on developing an interesting in-depth story that will have a complex story structure and style. The emphasis is on understanding process, from research skills to the final edit of a documentary length story. Students work on advanced interviewing techniques and more complex methods of gathering audio and video, effective writing to pictures. The goal is that students understand how style can enhance the meaning of the story. Research and primary shooting occurs over the summer with the equipment support from the department.   The professor works closely with the students in and out of class with attention to every detail of the production process. This means the student learns how to pitch a story and present it during the various stages of production. This one on one contact is an essential part of the learning process and distinct to our program.   WRR I: NEWS &amp; DOCUMENTARY - G54.1021.009 The best journalism flows from logical thinking, solid research, and comprehensive journalism. Through short deadline pieces and longer writing assignments this class will simulate a newsroom and teach you how to think like a journalist. New York City will be your reporting lab and you will be sent out into the city hunting for stories from day one. While the primary focus of this class is print, the skills will give you a strong journalism foundation that can be used in any media.   PRESS ETHICS - G54.0012.002 This course offers through the case method a critical examination of current and recurring ethical and legal issues in journalism. Areas covered include reporting practices, roles of editors and executives, conflict of interest, sources, defamation and privacy, criminal justice and national security.   POLITICAL CINEMA - G54.1182.11 In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do journalists and filmmakers fight against (or, alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? This class will focus primarily (though not exclusively) on one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East--though it will also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and the United States. Through journalistic readings and film screenings, we will explore how \"the other\" is constructed: politically, aesthetically, ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Mideast; the journalism of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them; filmmaking; and film criticism.   TV NEWSCAST: THE DIGITAL NEWSROOM- G54.1070 (Open to all graduate journalism students) Students learn broadcast writing skills in a real time situation by producing a live broadcast that goes out over the NYU cable to the dorms and public buildings. The emphasis of the class is on developing news judgment under tight deadline pressures. The students in the class perform all the editorial and technical roles on the newscast and report stories as well. We have national and international video footage from the CNN Pathfire news service and we have the AP ENPS news system that provides wires and software for formatting the newscast. Interview skills are developed during the newscast with in-depth newsmaker interviews. Positions are rotated to give students a sense of the different roles in a newsroom and the importance of teamwork.   LONG FORM VIDEO EDITING - GA1182.07 The class will explore the complexity of long form visualization and the various structural options possible through editing.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but the different ways of telling them.\u00a0 Through various exercises the students will experiment with various approaches and editing styles.\u00a0 Simultaneous with this class, students will be working on their own documentaries in Advanced TV Reporting.\u00a0 Whereas that class is more focused on concept and structure, the editing class will look closely at specific editing choices and techniques.   VISUAL THINKING- G54.1148 The class explores the complexity of documentary visualization through cinematography.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but also how we might inspire new ways of telling them visually.\u00a0 This class will immerse the students in the challenges of different approaches and shooting styles through production exercises and through significant documentary examples.   The students' work has won many awards from the Academy of TV Arts and Science Student Awards, the Christopher Awards and American Women in Radio and Television and appeared in many prestigious film festivals. They have also received travel grants from the National Television Academy Foundation and the Student Academy Awards.

The main goal will be a written exploration of the self to consider wider issues of history, community, identity, place, and family. The major assignments will be structured around various tasks: a personal essay will help to define themes and set scenes in the present; memoir writing will involve mining your memories of family to identify possible leads into the past; a reported piece will entail interviews of family members, historical research, and/or a visit to an ancestral site. These essays will be developed gradually with the help of shorter at-home assignments and in-class exercises on style, structure, and strategy. Revision will be built into the process, and we will read each other's work and give supportive feedback throughout the semester. Likely authors to be read and discussed for inspiration will include Ian Frazier, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Honor Moore, Lawrence Weschler, Sarah Vowell, Bliss Broyard, Brenda Lin, Tara Bray Smith, and D.J.
