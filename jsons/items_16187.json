history. His research interests include the global impact of the French Revolution and the Franco-German exchange during the Revolutionary Era, the transnational history of emotions in late 18th and 19th-century Europe, and the intersections of aesthetics, nationalism, and violence in German political culture.   Minsky has published work on German travelogues of post-revolutionary France, the French revolutionary and Napoleonic administration in the Rhineland, and the sentimentalized concept of liberty in the political philosophy of the German Enlightenment.   He is the recipient of grants and fellowships from the University of Pennsylvania, the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Doris G. Quinn Foundation, and the German Historical Institute in Washington DC.
