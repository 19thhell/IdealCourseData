If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Since then, we have expanded into health, the arts, and media studies.     As varied and diverse as our programs have been throughout the years, there is one thing that has never changed: Our commitment to studying and preparing professionals for pre-K-12 and higher education.    Read More                        Frequently Asked Questions            1. What is the difference between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE)?    The NYSED in Albany, NY is the state agency that issues your NYS teaching certificate which is required to work in public schools across NY State. The NYCDOE (formerly known as the NYC Board of Education) is your employer if you work for NYC Public Schools.    2. I am completing a Steinhardt certification program, must I apply for NYS certification or does it issue automatically?    You must apply for NYS certification, please see application instructions here    3. Must I also apply to the NYCDOE if I wish to work for NYC Public Schools? How can I show proof that I am enrolled in a teacher certification program?    Yes, please visit the TEACH NYC website here Speech and Language Disabilities or School Counseling students, click here    Please note if you have already registered as a student teacher you will need to re-register, create a new username and password and submit a new application when seeking employment within NYC public schools.    The NYCDOE application process will require a letter of expected completion . Please use letter here Please print, complete your information, scan or photograph and upload to your NYCDOE application. If you are unable to scan or photograph and upload, y ou may fax the letter to the NYCDOE at 718-935-3532, Attention: Pending Documents    Please also review the NYCDOE Application Process FAQ here    4. A NYC public school interested in hiring me is asking for my file number. What is a NYCDOE file number?    In the past, NYCDOE file numbers were issued when a NYS certified teacher applied for a NYC teaching license whether or not there was an offer of a teaching position. The NYCDOE no longer issues licenses.    The NYCDOE file number is a unique identifier issued to educators in the NYCDOE for payroll purposes. You are not issued a file number until after you have been hired and it will be issued after your first paycheck. If you were previously issued a file number as a substitute teacher or employee, you will keep that file number.    You do not need a file number to be hired (payrolled), it is processed through your social security number. Also see NYCDOE link here , scroll to bottom of page    5. I also wish to work for NYS public schools outside of NYC. Where can I apply and view job listings?    Please visit the OLAS JOBS website here    6. I'm an International Student without a social security number. Can I get fingerprinted for student teaching? Can I register for the NYS certification exams? Can I work for NYC public schools upon graduation?    Please click here    7.a. I was fingerprinted by the NYCDOE for student teaching, employment, etc. How can I tell if my fingerprint clearance appears in my NYSED TEACH account? My fingerprint clearance does not appear in my NYSED TEACH account, what should I do?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account (if you haven't yet created an account Self-Register here to do so), once logged it, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link , highlight Fingerprinting, click GO. You should see the statement \"We have received your fingerprint information from NYC\" ignore No Data Found underneath.    If your fingerprint information does not appear in your NYSED TEACH account, complete the OSPRA 104 Form here , do not check a box in Section 2 if none apply, mail or fax the form to the NYCDOE at the address or fax number at the bottom of the form. The NYCDOE will transfer your fingerprint clearance to the NYSED.    7.b. I was fingerprinted in the past through the NYSED and my fingerprint clearance appears in the NYSED TEACH system, how do I transfer my fingerprint clearance to the NYCDOE for the purposes of student teaching?       You must first be entered into the NYCDOE's Personnel Eligibility Tracking System (PETS). To do so you may either:    1) Email PETS Administration at PETSAdminSupport@schools.nyc.gov with the following information:    Name, SSN, DOB, primary telephone number, address (including zip), email address, name of College, title/job (e.g. student teacher, field observer), and school where you will be student teaching if you know it    OR    2) Telephone the NYCDOE's Office of Personnel Investigation (OPI) at 718-935-2665 to provide them with the same information as above.    Once you are entered into PETS, you will receive an email with instructions to log into the Applicant Gateway. You must complete and e-sign all required forms in Applicant Gateway. Once completed, you must go in person to the NYCDOE HR Connect Walk-in Center with a government-issued photo identification (ex: driver&rsquo;s license), your NYU ID, original I-9 documentation that shows eligibility to work in the U.S (please refer to the I-9 Eligibility Form for a complete list of acceptable documentation) and a completed OSPRA 103 .       8. I completed my certification program at Steinhardt and have not been recommended for certification to the NYSED, why not?    Program completers are not recommended automatically, you must request that Steinhardt recommend you after you've applied online, see question 2 above. The Request for Recommendation Form can be found in the application instructions.    9. I submitted my Request for Recommendation Form, why haven't I been recommended yet?    We recommend May and January completers only after all grades have been posted on your NYU record and your degree has been awarded. We recommend Summer completers once your summer grade(s) have all posted on your NYU record.    10. How will I know if my NYS Certificate has issued? How can I check the status of my certificate?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link, highlight Certificates, click GO. For more details, please visit NYSED link here    11. How can I show proof that I am certified? Will I receive my NYS Initial or Provisional (School Counseling only) Certificate in the mail?    The NYSED no longer issues paper Initial or Provisional Certificates, please see NYSED link here . You will not receive your certificate(s) in the mail (unless you request them for an additional fee, see below) nor will you receive an email indicating that they have issued in TEACH. Initial or Provisional Certificates will only issue in your TEACH account. The screen in your account indicating your issued status does not look like a certificate nor is it in pdf format. You could print this page or take a screenshot to email to prospective employers. The NYCDOE and other NYS school districts have access to TEACH and may view your certification status. However, if you need or wish to have a paper copy, you may request one for an additional fee. Once your certificate has issued in TEACH, log in to your account, click on TEACH Home on the top menu and then click on \"I would like a printed certificate\" under Online Application heading. Also see here    12. How can I apply for additional areas of certification (or extensions) now that I'm certified without having to complete another certification program?    The NYSED allows already certified individuals to apply for most additional areas of certification (or extensions) on their own (not through Steinhardt) through the Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate (Must hold a valid certificate) Pathway or the Individual Evaluation Pathway, you may view those requirements here    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    As a matter of policy NYU Steinhardt does not evaluate transcripts for individuals applying through an Individual Evaluation Pathway. Any evaluation completed other than by the NYSED would be unofficial and possibly inaccurate.    To apply for additional areas go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) or extension(s) online following the instructions on the website.    When prompted for a program code, y ou DO NOT enter a program code, instead select:          No, I have not completed, nor am I enrolled in, an Approved Teacher Preparation Program at a New York State College or University for this certificate and this type.          On the Interstate Reciprocity screen, select No, I am not eligible to apply through the Interstate Reciprocity Pathway. Then select the Individual Evaluation for an Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate Pathway or Individual Evaluation Pathway.    You will then have to mail your transcripts (and/or other documentation) and wait for them to review. You can request an NYU transcript here If your or an employing school wants to expedite the process once the NYSED has received your transcripts, please see here    You may wish to include course descriptions in your correspondence with the NYSED.    Steinhardt course descriptions may be found here or in current or past bulletins here    Include cover letter with name and SSN and mail with transcript(s) and course description(s) to:    Office of Teaching Initiatives New York State Education Department 89 Washington Ave, 5N EB Albany, New York 12234    *When your transcript(s) are first received your application will be listed as Ready for Review. Ready for Review means just that - your application hasn't been reviewed by an evaluator at the NYSED yet. The system defaults to \"deficient\" or \"unmet\" for some requirements until the application is evaluated, it more accurately should state \"not yet reviewed\" next the those requirements. The evaluation will change once your application is reviewed.    13. I hold Childhood Ed 1-6 Initial Certification, how can I add Early Childhood Ed Birth-2nd Grade (which includes Kindergarten) Certification?

To add Early Childhood B-2 (once you hold Childhood Ed 1-6) and/or Students with Disabilities (SWD) B-2 (if you also hold SWD 1-6) you will need to re-apply to the NYSED online and mail them your transcript(s). You are not applying for extensions, but rather stand alone certificates in EC ED and/or SWD B-2.    The NYSED will want to see at least 3 credits that focus exclusively on Early Childhood, see here , which you may have already completed as part of your program. If you have, go back to the TEACH Online system here , apply for the additional Initial Certificate(s) (or Professional only if you already hold Professional in another area) online following the instructions on the website.

Am I eligible to apply for certification in other states? Which states have reciprocity with NY?    Many states have signed an interstate agreement on reciprocity but it does not necessarily waive exam or fingerprinting requirements, see details here especially the section What it is not . You MUST still apply for certification in each state that you wish to be certified to teach in.    Some states do not require that you hold NYS certification to apply in their state, only that you've completed a traditional state approved certification program plus complete their additonal requirements such as exams and fingerprinting.    Other states such as California, Oregon and Texas do require that you hold NYS Certification to apply for certification in their state (according to their websites at the time that this website was last updated).    Best to check the certification website of the state you are hoping to be certified in.    According to the New Jersey Department of Education (609) 292-2070 (though not indicted on their website ) you do not need to complete their Praxis II testing requirements if you have passed the required NYS exams and hold NYS certification when you apply for NJ certificates in the same area(s).    Requirements for all states can be found easily online by searching for state name and teacher certification. Look for a link that states out of state prepared or out of state certified teacher which will outline the steps for you.    Direct link to the education departments of all fifty states and territories from the United States Department of Education here    While NYU Steinhardt will complete out of state verification forms required by the application process for other states (please see question 16), ultimately it is your responsibility to research and ensure that you meet or will meet the requirements of certification in that state. If you have questions regarding a particular state's requirements or application process, it is best to email or speak to one of their certification representatives.    16. Where can I send an out of state program verification form to be completed?    Please click here    17. I hold an Initial Certificate through my B.S. degree, what are my Master's degree options for satisfying Professional Certification?    Please see NYSED link here    18. What if my Initial Certificate is nearing expiration or has expired and I haven't completed the requirements for Professional Certification?    You may be able to apply for a time extension, please see details here , or a re-issuance, please see details here    As you would be applying directly to the NYSED for a time extension or re-issuance, please contact them with any questions you may have.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Since then, we have expanded into health, the arts, and media studies.     As varied and diverse as our programs have been throughout the years, there is one thing that has never changed: Our commitment to studying and preparing professionals for pre-K-12 and higher education.    Read More                        Frequently Asked Questions            1. What is the difference between the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE)?    The NYSED in Albany, NY is the state agency that issues your NYS teaching certificate which is required to work in public schools across NY State. The NYCDOE (formerly known as the NYC Board of Education) is your employer if you work for NYC Public Schools.    2. I am completing a Steinhardt certification program, must I apply for NYS certification or does it issue automatically?    You must apply for NYS certification, please see application instructions here    3. Must I also apply to the NYCDOE if I wish to work for NYC Public Schools? How can I show proof that I am enrolled in a teacher certification program?    Yes, please visit the TEACH NYC website here Speech and Language Disabilities or School Counseling students, click here    Please note if you have already registered as a student teacher you will need to re-register, create a new username and password and submit a new application when seeking employment within NYC public schools.    The NYCDOE application process will require a letter of expected completion . Please use letter here Please print, complete your information, scan or photograph and upload to your NYCDOE application. If you are unable to scan or photograph and upload, y ou may fax the letter to the NYCDOE at 718-935-3532, Attention: Pending Documents    Please also review the NYCDOE Application Process FAQ here    4. A NYC public school interested in hiring me is asking for my file number. What is a NYCDOE file number?    In the past, NYCDOE file numbers were issued when a NYS certified teacher applied for a NYC teaching license whether or not there was an offer of a teaching position. The NYCDOE no longer issues licenses.    The NYCDOE file number is a unique identifier issued to educators in the NYCDOE for payroll purposes. You are not issued a file number until after you have been hired and it will be issued after your first paycheck. If you were previously issued a file number as a substitute teacher or employee, you will keep that file number.    You do not need a file number to be hired (payrolled), it is processed through your social security number. Also see NYCDOE link here , scroll to bottom of page    5. I also wish to work for NYS public schools outside of NYC. Where can I apply and view job listings?    Please visit the OLAS JOBS website here    6. I'm an International Student without a social security number. Can I get fingerprinted for student teaching? Can I register for the NYS certification exams? Can I work for NYC public schools upon graduation?    Please click here    7.a. I was fingerprinted by the NYCDOE for student teaching, employment, etc. How can I tell if my fingerprint clearance appears in my NYSED TEACH account? My fingerprint clearance does not appear in my NYSED TEACH account, what should I do?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account (if you haven't yet created an account Self-Register here to do so), once logged it, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link , highlight Fingerprinting, click GO. You should see the statement \"We have received your fingerprint information from NYC\" ignore No Data Found underneath.    If your fingerprint information does not appear in your NYSED TEACH account, complete the OSPRA 104 Form here , do not check a box in Section 2 if none apply, mail or fax the form to the NYCDOE at the address or fax number at the bottom of the form. The NYCDOE will transfer your fingerprint clearance to the NYSED.    7.b. I was fingerprinted in the past through the NYSED and my fingerprint clearance appears in the NYSED TEACH system, how do I transfer my fingerprint clearance to the NYCDOE for the purposes of student teaching?       You must first be entered into the NYCDOE's Personnel Eligibility Tracking System (PETS). To do so you may either:    1) Email PETS Administration at PETSAdminSupport@schools.nyc.gov with the following information:    Name, SSN, DOB, primary telephone number, address (including zip), email address, name of College, title/job (e.g. student teacher, field observer), and school where you will be student teaching if you know it    OR    2) Telephone the NYCDOE's Office of Personnel Investigation (OPI) at 718-935-2665 to provide them with the same information as above.    Once you are entered into PETS, you will receive an email with instructions to log into the Applicant Gateway. You must complete and e-sign all required forms in Applicant Gateway. Once completed, you must go in person to the NYCDOE HR Connect Walk-in Center with a government-issued photo identification (ex: driver&rsquo;s license), your NYU ID, original I-9 documentation that shows eligibility to work in the U.S (please refer to the I-9 Eligibility Form for a complete list of acceptable documentation) and a completed OSPRA 103 .       8. I completed my certification program at Steinhardt and have not been recommended for certification to the NYSED, why not?    Program completers are not recommended automatically, you must request that Steinhardt recommend you after you've applied online, see question 2 above. The Request for Recommendation Form can be found in the application instructions.    9. I submitted my Request for Recommendation Form, why haven't I been recommended yet?    We recommend May and January completers only after all grades have been posted on your NYU record and your degree has been awarded. We recommend Summer completers once your summer grade(s) have all posted on your NYU record.    10. How will I know if my NYS Certificate has issued? How can I check the status of my certificate?    Log in to your NYSED TEACH account, click on TEACH Home, click on the Account Information link, highlight Certificates, click GO. For more details, please visit NYSED link here    11. How can I show proof that I am certified? Will I receive my NYS Initial or Provisional (School Counseling only) Certificate in the mail?    The NYSED no longer issues paper Initial or Provisional Certificates, please see NYSED link here . You will not receive your certificate(s) in the mail (unless you request them for an additional fee, see below) nor will you receive an email indicating that they have issued in TEACH. Initial or Provisional Certificates will only issue in your TEACH account. The screen in your account indicating your issued status does not look like a certificate nor is it in pdf format. You could print this page or take a screenshot to email to prospective employers. The NYCDOE and other NYS school districts have access to TEACH and may view your certification status. However, if you need or wish to have a paper copy, you may request one for an additional fee. Once your certificate has issued in TEACH, log in to your account, click on TEACH Home on the top menu and then click on \"I would like a printed certificate\" under Online Application heading. Also see here    12. How can I apply for additional areas of certification (or extensions) now that I'm certified without having to complete another certification program?    The NYSED allows already certified individuals to apply for most additional areas of certification (or extensions) on their own (not through Steinhardt) through the Additional Classroom Teaching Certificate (Must hold a valid certificate) Pathway or the Individual Evaluation Pathway, you may view those requirements here    If you were certified prior to the NYSED's new DASA workshop requirement, you will need to complete the DASA workshop prior to the issuance of any additional or new certificates, please see details here    As a matter of policy NYU Steinhardt does not evaluate transcripts for individuals applying through an Individual Evaluation Pathway.

Am I eligible to apply for certification in other states? Which states have reciprocity with NY?    Many states have signed an interstate agreement on reciprocity but it does not necessarily waive exam or fingerprinting requirements, see details here especially the section What it is not . You MUST still apply for certification in each state that you wish to be certified to teach in.    Some states do not require that you hold NYS certification to apply in their state, only that you've completed a traditional state approved certification program plus complete their additonal requirements such as exams and fingerprinting.    Other states such as California, Oregon and Texas do require that you hold NYS Certification to apply for certification in their state (according to their websites at the time that this website was last updated).    Best to check the certification website of the state you are hoping to be certified in.    According to the New Jersey Department of Education (609) 292-2070 (though not indicted on their website ) you do not need to complete their Praxis II testing requirements if you have passed the required NYS exams and hold NYS certification when you apply for NJ certificates in the same area(s).    Requirements for all states can be found easily online by searching for state name and teacher certification. Look for a link that states out of state prepared or out of state certified teacher which will outline the steps for you.    Direct link to the education departments of all fifty states and territories from the United States Department of Education here    While NYU Steinhardt will complete out of state verification forms required by the application process for other states (please see question 16), ultimately it is your responsibility to research and ensure that you meet or will meet the requirements of certification in that state. If you have questions regarding a particular state's requirements or application process, it is best to email or speak to one of their certification representatives.    16.

It was founded by Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury in the Jefferson and Madison administrations. Gallatin aimed to establish \" in this immense and fast - growing city ,&rdquo; as he put it , &ldquo; a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously opened to all .\" He was inspired in part by the founders of the University of London , with whom he communicated . As they did , he envisioned a university inspired by and imbued with the intense activity and energy of city life and city commerce. He spoke of NYU as being &ldquo;in and of the city,&rdquo; but even then a city linked with other parts of the world.    In 1890, at a time of immense ferment in American schooling, and mass immigration to New York City, NYU opened the first university-based graduate school dedicated to the advanced education of teachers and school administrators. Thus NYU implicitly rejected what was then the prevailing idea &ndash; namely, that universities are not essential to the education of educators, that practical knowledge alone, rather than integrated practical and theoretical knowledge, is sufficient input for learning to teach.    Called the School of Pedagogy, the new school was the forerunner of today&rsquo;s Steinhardt School, which remains the NYU home of teacher education. Over the course of the twentieth century, the School also became the NYU home of graduate and undergraduate professional education in media, applied psychology, physical and occupational therapy, nutrition, music, and the visual arts. All of these programs emerged from an initial focus on the learning needs of pre-collegiate youth.    Today, NYU teacher education spans many program areas and three Steinhardt departments: the Department of Teaching and Learning ; the Department of Art and Arts Professions ; and the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions . At the same time, the NYU Teacher Education Program as a whole has a general pedagogical core, including a set of core courses and faculty communities of practice overseeing them; an organizational core comprised of a Teacher Education Council and Teacher Education Working Group; and five core values described below that derive from its history, as well as its ambition to meet the contemporary challenges of teacher education.    The NYU Teacher Education Program is fully accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council.    Core Values       To be in and of the city and engage deeply in New York schools    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching    To integrate theory and practice proactively rather than expect students to do it on their own    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - and in this sense to be in and of the world    To engage habitually in organizational self-scrutiny, and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education       To be in and of the city and engaged deeply in New York schools.    The orientation to the city accounts for NYU&rsquo;s successful efforts over the last decade to build a large network of partnership schools serving some of New York City&rsquo;s poorest neighborhoods. This orientation also accounts for the emphasis across the program&rsquo;s core courses and fieldwork on the role that even the poorest communities can play as resources for children, youth, families, and teachers. Finally, it accounts for how NYU discharges its obligations under accreditation by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council to educate teachers to be caring professionals.    To value content knowledge (disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional), and also pedagogical knowledge as crucial for effective teaching.    The attention NYU pays to both content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge -- evident in the 1890 launch of teacher education at NYU &ndash; has continued to shape it in the century since. In 2004, for example, NYU established a university-wide oversight committee for teacher education called the Teacher Education Council. It is co-chaired by the Dean of Steinhardt and the Dean of the College of Arts and Science, and includes members of the Teacher Education Faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Science, and faculty from other Steinhardt programs which contribute to teacher education &ndash; for example, programs in the arts, in psychology, and in the history of education.    To integrate theory and practice pro-actively rather than expect students to do it on their own.    The third core value of NYU Teacher Education holds that it is not enough to give equal attention to content and pedagogy. Good programs must also help students integrate what they are learning in these areas. This value accounts for the extensive emphasis at NYU on well-scaffolded fieldwork, including field-based courses and seminars; and on maintaining a faculty whose members across ranks include both those with deep connections to practice, and those with rich experience in content and content research.    To promote intercultural openness as a tool for teaching &ndash; and in this sense to be in and of the world.    The fourth value - NYU&rsquo;s promotion of intercultural openness as a tool for teaching - accounts for the recent development of cross-national programs at NYU in the teaching of Spanish, Chinese, and French ; for an increase in the number of international teacher candidates; for study-abroad opportunities in teacher education ; and for increased efforts across program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates gain proficiency in teaching English language learners . It also accounts for efforts across the program core and program areas to ensure that NYU teacher candidates acquire an ethic of cultural respect in the face of probable cultural mismatch between their own backgrounds and the backgrounds of increasing numbers of their students. Today&rsquo;s NYU candidates launch their teaching careers amid the greatest mass migration of peoples and contact among cultures the world has ever known. Being &ldquo;in and of the city&rdquo; of New York, the city of immigrants, gives NYU a unique position for helping future teachers develop global competence within and beyond US borders.    To engage habitually in organizational self - scrutiny , and in the process to contribute to the knowledge base for effective teaching and teacher education .    Finally, the fifth core value of teacher education at NYU &ndash; the emphasis on data-based self-scrutiny and rigorous research &ndash; accounts for NYU&rsquo;s active efforts to be accountable for its impact on its students and on their students. The inventive Center for Research on Teaching and Learning is central to these efforts. This value also accounts for the faculty&rsquo;s many contributions to teacher education elsewhere also.    Today, as non-university teacher education programs proliferate, NYU remains an outspoken advocate of the important role that research universities can play in the education of teachers. NYU faculty are now studying how children learn science, how games can be used to teach science, how students transition to high school, how teacher management and teacher care co-mingle in classrooms, how schools manage discipline, how young black men progress through elementary and middle school years, how school-university partnerships function, how the learning of English language learners may best be assessed, how mathematics disability intersects or not with reading disability, and much more of great usefulness to the world.
