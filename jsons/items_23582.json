A fundamental challenge that is common to the signals carried by all visual neurons is that they must remain sensitive as the ambient light intensity varies over many orders of magnitude. There's well over a million-fold change in intensity between a starlit night and a bright sunny day at the beach. This is a challenge for the nervous system because neurons have a very limited response range: -80mV to +50 mV of graded potential in the non-spiking cells of the retina, or 0 to about 200 spikes per second for ganglion cells. The retina solves this problem by adapting to the ambient level of illumination. If the light level changes by a relatively small amount, then the visual system compensates for the change almost immediately. However, if the light level changes by a lot, then the eye takes a long time to re-adjust.               You must have noticed this phenomenon. When you are outside on a sunny day, and then walk into a darkened room, at first you can hardly see anything. For example, if people come into a darkened movie theater they are constantly tripping and stumbling over their seats on the way in. However, after being in the theater for a while, you adjust to the lower light level of the theater, and it becomes very easy to see your way around. This phenomenon is called adaptation , and the particular direction I just mentioned, where you adjust from the light to the dark, is called dark adaptation.           This figure shows the results of an experiment that quantifies this  common experience. A  subject was exposed to a bright adapting light, and then (while in the  dark) their threshold was measured for detecting a very weak test light  at various times  after exposure to the bright light. The test light was violet in color.  Filled  symbols correspond to when the violet spot had threshold intensity and  the violet color was evident at threshold.  Open  symbols mean that the violet color was not noticeable. Each curve  corresponds  to a different light level for the adapting light. The subject became  more  and  more sensitive to the test light over time.      There are two very striking features. First, the data fall naturally  into two  parts - this double-branching is due to the transition from cones to  rods. Second, the recovery is a fairly slow process - the subject's  sensitivity  to the light flash  continued to increase over a very long time. In fact, after exposure to  a  very bright light, such as the subject was exposed to in the top curve  of the  figure,  the subject did not fully recover to the best value for nearly forty  minutes  in the dark.    Light adaptation in the retina: The basic mechanisms responsible for controlling light/dark adaptation are quite complex. Part of the mechanism is the switch-over from rods to cones. But even within the pure rod (or pure cone) regime there is still significant adaptation. Only a small part of the adaptation is due to changes in pupil size; the pupil diameter only ranges from 1 or 2 mm to about 8 mm, for an increase in area (or total light entering the eye) of a factor of 16-64. A lot of the adaptation occurs in the photoreceptors themselves. Part of the adaptation within the photoreceptors is due to photopigment bleaching - less photopigment available at high light levels results in weaker responses to light increments at those high light levels. Adaptation within the photoreceptors is also helped along by feedback from horizontal cells onto the photoreceptors to control the responsiveness of the photoreceptors. If the horizontal cells respond strongly then they tell the photoreceptors to turn it down a bit.           Differences between rod and cone  vision: There are a number of differences between daylight  vision ( photopic light levels,  using your cones) and low-light levels ( scotopic light levels, using rods). The first, higher branch of the above dark adaptation curves involves your photopic or cone system. Cones are most numerous at the fovea, and sensitivity is best there for photopic vision. Cones come in three types, responsible for your ability to discriminate colors (we'll talk about this more in the color lecture). Thus, in the above curves the violet color of the test light was evident for the photopic/cone portion of the curve. Photopic spectral sensitivity peaks at 560 nm, so that in photopic vision a yellow flash will be easiest to detect, and will appear the brightest. Cones are fast responders, so in the photopic range your ability to see fast flicker is high. Finally, cones are more sensitive to stimuli passing through the center of the pupil than passing through the edge of the pupil (this is called the Stiles-Crawford  effect ) because the cones are positioned and oriented toward the center of the pupil. For rods (scotopic vision, the second branch of the dark adaptation curves) we see different effects: sensitivity is highest in the parafovea (around the fovea), spectral sensitivity peaks at about 507 nm (so that green objects appear brightest), rods are slow (and can only detect very slow flicker) and show no Stiles-Crawford effect. At twilight light levels ( mesopic light levels), both cones and rods are available for vision.    Afterimages: After being exposed to a bright light (e.g., flashbulb) you experience an afterimage, that is a (sometimes blueish) spot in your visual field. What causes the afterimage? The afterimage moves with you when you move your eyes. Why? After exposing a bit of your retina to bright light, the retinal becomes light adapted, but only where the light fell . In other  words, light adaptation is local to the region of the retina that was  stimulated. If after adapting to a small, bright light, you then look  at a bright uniform field (e.g., a white wall), the adapted retina will  be less sensitive, and that portion of the wall will look darker. This  is called a negative afterimage .  On the other hand, if you instead look at a very dark uniform field,  there will again be an afterimage, but it will appear lighter than the  background. This is called a positive  afterimage , and the theory is that the adapted retina is  signalling a weak stimulus when no stimulus is present, often referred  to with the wonderful term: dark  light .    Consequences for studying the rest of the visual system:   Light/dark adaptation is a big effect and it happens at the front end  of the visual system.  One of the important consequences of this is that we need to be very  clever  to avoid effects of light/dark adaptation when we want to study later  stages  of visual processing. Let's say we are recording from a retinal  ganglion  cell. If we use visual stimuli that vary between being very bright and  very  dark, then we will see a lot of light adaptation (that is mostly due to  processing  in the photoreceptors and horizontal cells).    We can, however, safely ignore light adaptation by restricting our  choice of visual stimuli to intensity distributions that modulate  (transiently) about  a fixed mean/background intensity. Examples are moving or flickering  grating  patterns and moving or briefly flashed bars that are either brighter or  darker  than the mean. The mean/background light intensity is typically chosen  to  be half the brightest intensity attainable on the display device.    Contrast: Contrast is the percent change in the light  intensity in an image relative to the average light intensity.           The contrast of a sinusoidal grating stimulus is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest intensities, divided by the sum of the two, or equivalently as the amplitude of modulation divided by the mean. The maximum possible contrast is 1 (100%), which is attained when the lowest intensity is zero and the highest intensity is twice the mean/background intensity. The contrast can go no higher than this, as this would imply having the intensity of the darkest portions of the stimulus go negative, which is physically impossible. The contrast of a stimulus is changed by scaling the image intensities above and below the fixed mean/background intensity.           Neural responses in most of the visual system increase with contrast. The figure above, for example, shows that activity in visual cortex increase with contrast.      Summary: There are 4 mechanisms underlying light/dark adaptation:       Pupil size    Switchover from rods to cones    Bleaching/regeneration of the photopigments    Feedback from the horizontal cells to control the responsiveness  of the photoreceptors         The combined effect is to make the retina more sensitive at low light  levels and less sensitive at high light levels. This has  important consequences for perception (see notes on Brightness ).       It also has important consequences for how we design vision  experiments - we often use transient stimuli like flickering grating  patterns  that are characterized in terms of their contrast.

Starting Spring 2010, this course will require Writing the Short Screenplay (H56.1020) or Script Analysis (H56.1084).    A vigorous workshop in the craft of adaptation (developing screenplays and teleplays from works of fiction and non-fiction.) The source material covered will include short stories, novels, news items, biographies, and true stories developed from journalistic sources and original research. We'll explore research methods and learn how to evaluate source material to determine which material invites adaptation.    Through selection of your own projects (which you will research and develop from pitch to outline to first scenes) you will learn how to translate the essential elements of the source material's story, theme, main characters, and tone into well structured screenplays.
