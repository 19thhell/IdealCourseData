It has taken a variety of forms, from attention to the modalities and effects of circulation - the result of diplomatic exchange and gifting, long-distance trade, or looting and reuse, for example - to research on media and regions that lie on the margins of the Islamic world, or outside the traditional boundaries of the canon.
