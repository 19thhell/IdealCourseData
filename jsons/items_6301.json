And to help you (and those you talk to) in your new role as revolutionary, here are some quotations that I keep under my pillow at night:       \"IF YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGED, YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION\".        (anonymous)       \"KNOW THYSELF (starting with your class)\"        (Socrates, with a little help from Marx)       \"WHEREVER YOU FIND INJUSTICE,     THE PROPER FORM OF POLITENESS IS     ATTACK\".        (T-Bone Slim)       \"THE GREAT APPEAR GREAT IN OUR EYES     BECAUSE WE ARE KNEELING.     LET US RISE\".        (French Revolution)       \"IF NOT THIS, THEN WHAT?     IF NOT YOU, THEN WHO?     IF NOT NOW, THEN WHEN?\"        (with apologies to the Talmud)       \"TODAY IS THE TIME THAT      COULD BECOME TOMORROW\"        (Victor Jara, Chilean song writer killed by Pinochet)        \"LET US SHARE JOY AND PAIN...      LET US DARE EVERYTHING...      WHAT IS TO BE AVOIDED ABOVE ALL IS      TO SAY NOTHING,      AND TO WANT NOTHING, AND TO DO NOTHING\".        (from a youthful poem by Karl Marx)        \"LEAVE A MARK ON HISTORY. THERE MAY NOT BE MONEY      IN IT, BUT IT IS MORE EXCITING THAN      STUDYING ACCOUNTING\".         (Abbie Hoffman)     (If I've left out any quotations that you think deserve a place on this list, send them to me on the Message Board so I can consider whether to include them.)
