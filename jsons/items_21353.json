Let us not get    carried away.    Though I\u2019ve woven myself into her soft bough, I have people to do and things to see. Places to be with memories like thin ribbons or ties that bind\u2014Doc tor, when I was fou r I had this pill ow that I brought wit h me everywhere. A delight so rare of a fabric so fine; she was so fter than anything on t   he face of the  earth. M y folly\u2019s what lost her. I   haven\u2019t been  the S         ame since S aid happening. Have you noticed, Doctor, that in my nervousness I\u2019ve hidden my hands in my sleeves? This sweater, once as white as snow, was given to me by my mother         and coveted bY     my  sister who thrE         atened to throw M e into blue wilderness. InsteA    d she sold  me into slaverY,         and like Jospeh A ccepting his fate, I\u2019ve embraced the savage solitude of loneliness. Boy , she said, Momma\u2019s gone. Earn your  keep .  I  imagine    Moses must have been    an awkward lover.    Take it on the chin ,    said Zipporah, you\u2019ve come     too quickly dear prophet     and you\u2019ve cut     holes in all of my finest     linens . I\u2019ve wondered, too often, about my place in this world. So I\u2019ve found wo(men) to lie with. Churlish par amours granting high pleasures and satin scars that tell stories and little more than that. I am an awkward lover, like Moses. I am wandering, like Moses. Taken from  Mississippi   waters and perhaps, like Moses, I may never see                                                                                                                      This promised sweater, picked from earth with weary fingertips and sewn with sullen sable hands, I\u2019ve had since the age of twelve. Now  stained with chitter ling drippings and two yellow rings of sweat and Mum. I\u2019ve mellow ed since twelve, Doctor, doing word find puzzles and I\u2019ve heard that if you focus hard enough each word has dimension. Tough puzzle though. See here I\u2019ve found: miss\u2014 Understand that this fascination I have with pattern and ordered disorder is only an appreciation of nu ance. You\u2019ve mis understood my understand ing that even pho nemes have distinct complexity, weav ing every strand of memory and mythos; like thin ribbons or ties that bind.

Let us not get    carried away.    Though I\u2019ve woven myself into her soft bough, I have people to do and things to see. Places to be with memories like thin ribbons or ties that bind\u2014Doc tor, when I was fou r I had this pill ow that I brought wit h me everywhere. A delight so rare of a fabric so fine; she was so fter than anything on t   he face of the  earth. M y folly\u2019s what lost her. I   haven\u2019t been  the S         ame since S aid happening. Have you noticed, Doctor, that in my nervousness I\u2019ve hidden my hands in my sleeves? This sweater, once as white as snow, was given to me by my mother         and coveted bY     my  sister who thrE         atened to throw M e into blue wilderness. InsteA    d she sold  me into slaverY,         and like Jospeh A ccepting his fate, I\u2019ve embraced the savage solitude of loneliness. Boy , she said, Momma\u2019s gone. Earn your  keep .  I  imagine    Moses must have been    an awkward lover.    Take it on the chin ,    said Zipporah, you\u2019ve come     too quickly dear prophet     and you\u2019ve cut     holes in all of my finest     linens . I\u2019ve wondered, too often, about my place in this world. So I\u2019ve found wo(men) to lie with. Churlish par amours granting high pleasures and satin scars that tell stories and little more than that. I am an awkward lover, like Moses. I am wandering, like Moses. Taken from  Mississippi   waters and perhaps, like Moses, I may never see                                                                                                                      This promised sweater, picked from earth with weary fingertips and sewn with sullen sable hands, I\u2019ve had since the age of twelve. Now  stained with chitter ling drippings and two yellow rings of sweat and Mum. I\u2019ve mellow ed since twelve, Doctor, doing word find puzzles and I\u2019ve heard that if you focus hard enough each word has dimension. Tough puzzle though. See here I\u2019ve found: miss\u2014 Understand that this fascination I have with pattern and ordered disorder is only an appreciation of nu ance. You\u2019ve mis understood my understand ing that even pho nemes have distinct complexity, weav ing every strand of memory and mythos; like thin ribbons or ties that bind.
