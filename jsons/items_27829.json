School of Law established.   1841: School of Medicine established.   1894: The undergraduate college moves to more spacious University Heights campus in the Bronx. Back at Washington Square, the University Building is demolished and construction begins on the Main Building, later renamed the Silver Center.   1917: The U.S. enters World War I, decreasing University enrollment and straining the budget. Chancellor Brown establishes branches of the Student Army Training Corps fulfilling the University's public responsibility during the war, and also helping save the school from financial ruin.   1929: The stock market crashes on Black Tuesday, starting the Great Depression. In the coming years, Chancellor Chase founded the Division of Continuing Education,the Center for Research and Graduate Studies and the School of Public Service in order to keep enrollment up despite the economic state.          1941: After the U.S. enters World War II, military training was established on campus. The War Placement Bureau was organized to assign many of technically trained faculty and staff to military and civilian agency positions. The University Heights campus became largely militarized while liberal arts and language training was offered for Army officers at Washington Square. Following the war, the University received the largest contingent of returning veterans in the nation, and enrollment rose back to its pre-war levels.   1968: Student activism becomes a major part of university life, as students engage in civil rights demonstrations at Washington Square Park. The late 60s and early 70s sees an unprecedented degree of student involvement with civil rights and anti-war movements. Students also start demand changes within the University, staging sit-ins, boycotts, and marches protesting tuition and dormitory rate increases.   1970: President Hester\u2019s administration embarked on a mission to raise $222.5 million in five years, the largest fund-raising effort ever undertaken by the University.   1973: University Heights campus is closed, with the University's main campus shifting back to Washington Square.   1976: The annual commencement ceremony is shifted from Madison Square Garden to Washington Square Park.   1985: President Brademas introduces the Billion Dollar Campaign, a landmark fund-raising plan to raise $1 billion by the year 2000.        1995: President Brademas's $1 billion fund-raising goal is met five years early.   2001: The September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center send shockwaves through the University, which had occupied several downtown buildings as dormitories in 1998.   2004: President Sexton announces two new fund-raising and spending programs. The first is a 7-year, $2.5 billion fund-raising campaign. The Partners Fund is proposed to expand the faculty of arts and science by 20 percent within five years.   2007: Plans are announced to open a portal campus in Abu Dhabi. When it opens in October 2009 it, along with the University's 10 other academic centers, will become part of NYU's Global Network University.        2010: NYU Abu Dhabi welcomes its inaugural class of students.   2013: NYU Shanghai welcomes its inaugural class of students.

The group of founders\u2014which included former Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin\u2014envisioned a non-denominational institution that would be \u201ca social investment and a direct response to the needs of the rising mercantile classes in New York,\u201d intended both for those students \u201cwho devote themselves to scientific or literary pursuits,\u201d and for those preparing for \u201cthe learned professions, commerce, or the mechanical and useful arts.\u201d   In October 1832, the first classes began in rented quarters located downtown near City Hall, in contemporary subjects such as architecture, civil engineering, astronomy, chemistry, sculpture, painting, English and modern languages, as well as classical Greek and Latin.   After a search for a permanent home, the University Council purchased the northeast block of Washington Square East for $40,000, and a handsome Gothic building was built there in 1835. The University Building, as it was known, offered an urbane mix of academic spaces on its lower floors and rental apartments above\u2014rooms and studios whose extraordinary roster of tenants included the artist Winslow Homer, the inventors Samuel F.B. Morse and Samuel Colt (who perfected the electric telegraph and revolver there, respectively), and the architects A.J. Davis and Richard Morris Hunt.   Throughout the 19th century, the University suffered from financial problems and an undergraduate enrollment that never exceeded 150 students. However, though the undergraduate program struggled to fulfill the vision of its founders, NYU\u2019s professional and graduate programs\u2014in law (1835), medicine (1841), dentistry (1865), arts and sciences (1886), and education (1890)\u2014were a success from the start, contributing to New York\u2019s stunning commercial rise and serving as an engine of upward mobility for thousands of native-born and immigrant New Yorkers.   In the late 19th century, under the leadership of Chancellor Henry Mitchell MacCracken, the university advanced significantly, drawing together its far-flung schools under central control and attracting a more business-like Board of Trustees and donors. In what he called a \u201csecond founding,\u201d MacCracken moved the undergraduate schools of arts and science and engineering to an entirely new campus in the Bronx, on a bluff overlooking Manhattan\u2014a stunning second home for what was now known by a new name: New York University.   Having moved nearly all of its undergraduates to the new Bronx campus, NYU turned Washington Square into a bustling center for graduate and professional training\u2014including one of the country\u2019s first university-affiliated business schools (1900)\u2014to serve what had become the undisputed commercial capital of America and the second-largest city in the world.   Then, in 1914, NYU made the decision to establish an additional undergraduate program downtown that would serve commuter students. Called Washington Square College, it offered an education to nearly all qualified students, regardless of background. With students who were \u201cfamished\u2026for knowledge, any kind of knowledge,\u201d and a young and creative faculty, Washington Square College was, in one professor\u2019s later words, \u201cthe most exciting venture in American education that I had ever heard of.\u201d   As enrollments exploded\u2014from 500 students in 1919 to more than 7,000 by 1929\u2014NYU scrambled to hire instructors. Among them was a young writer named Thomas Wolfe, who, while working on his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel , taught English from 1924 to 1930. There is \u201cno other way in which a man coming to this terrific city,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccould have had a more\u2026stimulating introduction to its swarming life, than through the corridors and classrooms of Washington Square.\u201d   A number of new graduate schools complemented NYU\u2019s undergraduate growth: the College of Nursing (1932), the Institute of Fine Arts (1933), the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (1934), and new colleges in continuing education (1934; now the School of Professional Studies) and public service (1938), the latter founded with the encouragement of Mayor La Guardia, himself an NYU alumnus.   NYU had taken on a role like no other private university in American history: a vast educational machine, by which tens of thousands of upwardly mobile New Yorkers\u2014most of them Jewish and Catholic students, from working and middle-class families\u2014could receive college-level training and move into the professions or business. With the largest private enrollment in the country\u2014an astonishing 47,000 students by 1939\u2014NYU had in many ways become the great urban university its founders dreamed of.   The postwar decades were a period of continued growth for NYU, as returning GIs swelled the student body even further; schools of social work (1960), the arts (1965), and individualized study (1972) were added; and plans were made under the leadership of President James Hester to construct the university\u2019s first central library.   By 1973, however, as New York City reeled from years of rising crime and financial troubles and enrollments declined, NYU\u2014which had been running annual deficits since 1964\u2014reluctantly sold its Bronx campus in order to regain solvency.   These difficulties had one very positive result: they provided the opportunity to make a sweeping assessment of NYU\u2019s future. The university had been founded on the two ideals of democratic promise and academic excellence. Since the 1920s, NYU had been fulfilling its democratic promise as no other private university in America; now, emerging from the crises of the \u201870s, it daringly sought to fulfill its founders\u2019 other dream\u2014to transform itself from a respected metropolitan institution to a global seat of learning, in the top tier of world universities.   Throughout the 1970s, NYU gradually regained firm financial footing and began to improve the quality of its faculty, strengthen the curriculum, and establish more stringent admissions requirements. By the early 1980s, with the university\u2019s financial health restored and New York itself emerging at last from decades of social and economic troubles, NYU was poised for a new era of growth.   In 1984, seeking to achieve what its recently appointed president, John Brademas, called \u201ca new position of eminence in American higher education,\u201d NYU undertook one of the first billion-dollar capital campaigns in academic history. Raising two million dollars a week for five hundred weeks, the university reached its goal in only ten years\u2014five years ahead of schedule. President Brademas\u2019s tenure also saw the transformation of Washington Square from a largely commuter campus into a residential one, with extensive construction and renovation of residence halls.   In 1991, NYU\u2019s chancellor, L. Jay Oliva, was tapped as the university\u2019s new president. Under President Oliva\u2014a historian who had spent his entire academic career at NYU\u2014the pace of advancement continued without stop. One of his primary goals was to ensure that the fast-rising stature of the professional schools and arts divisions were matched by an equivalent commitment to the humanities and social science departments\u2014many of which are now ranked among the best in the world.   President Oliva also oversaw a major growth in international studies, drawing record numbers of international students and scholars to NYU and establishing more study-away sites abroad. In 1994, NYU\u2019s global presence gained a powerful centerpiece when Sir Harold Acton bequeathed Villa La Pietra, a 57-acre estate in Florence\u2014at the time the largest single gift made to an American university.   By the end of the millennium, the university had accomplished the near-impossible, dramatically raising the academic rankings, professional stature, and student selectivity of nearly every one of its divisions and departments. As one scholar wrote in 2003, NYU was \u201cthe success story in contemporary American higher education.\u201d   Under John Sexton, who became president in 2002 after coming to NYU as a faculty member and then serving as dean of the Law School, NYU\u2019s reach and stature have grown still further, securing its position as one of the world\u2019s premier research universities and a global leader in higher education in the 21st century.   Early in President Sexton\u2019s tenure, the university identified a key strategic priority: the need to expand, strengthen, and energize the arts and sciences, the academic core of the university. From 2004 to 2009, the Partners program\u2014led by a gift of $60 million from six trustees and matched by another $150 million in university funds\u2014resulted in the most rapid expansion of NYU\u2019s faculty in its history. With 125 positions added to the arts and science faculty\u2014an increase of some 20 percent\u2014and significant renovations made to academic facilities, the Partners program had a transformative effect on scores of academic departments.   Another recent academic milestone has been the re-establishment of engineering at NYU for the first time since the sale of the Bronx campus in the 1970s. After beginning a successful affiliation with Brooklyn\u2019s Polytechnic University in 2008, a full merger between the two schools resulted in the creation of the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering in 2014.   The past decade has seen the founding of several prominent institutes and centers as well, including the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (2006), the Center for Urban Science and Progress (2012), and the Global Institute of Public Health (2012).   A signature of President Sexton\u2019s tenure has been the creation of a new model of university: the global network university. Building on the international presence it established in the 20th century, NYU in the 21st century added more global academic centers, with a particular focus on expanding outside of Europe to locations such as Accra and Buenos Aires. Then, in 2010, in what President Sexton termed \u201can audacious step in higher education,\u201d the university opened NYU Abu Dhabi, the first comprehensive liberal arts campus in the Middle East to be operated by an American research university. A second campus, NYU Shanghai, followed in 2013. Today, with its three campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai and 11 academic centers on six continents, no university has a greater global presence.   In 1831, NYU\u2019s founders chose to create an institution of learning that would be \u201cin and of the city.\u201d In the ensuing years, New York City has become the world\u2019s first truly international city, and NYU has evolved with it. NYU\u2019s more than 44,000 students and 4,500 faculty members are uniquely positioned to shape the 21st century as creative, thoughtful, engaged citizens. They learn and teach at what has become one of the world\u2019s premier institutions of higher learning. They draw from and contribute to the inexhaustibly rich complexity of New York City. And, as they circulate throughout the global network, they build cultural bridges and perspectives that are critical in an ever-more global society. Still vitally \u201cin and of the city,\u201d NYU is now, too, \u201cin and of the world.\u201d          Back to Top                                                                     Introduction        The University       History and Traditions of New York University        A Brief History of New York University     University Traditions          Organization and Administration        The University Charter     The Board of Trustees     University Officers     The University Senate     University Councils and Committees     Organization of Colleges, Schools, and Academic Departments                    The Faculty         The Students         Selected University Policies                                            Download the        Faculty Handbook (pdf)                                                                        NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
