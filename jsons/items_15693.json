The NYU Abu Dhabi pre-professional course draws upon the extensive programs of the NYU School of Law , including international law, environmental law, and US constitutional law, areas that reinforce the other programs in the NYUAD curriculum.

Nature has its laws. Religions have theirs, societies theirs, families theirs. Business has its rules and contracts. How do people understand the laws that are as much a part of life as the weather? Literature&mdash;the work of the imagination&mdash;guides our great journey towards understanding. Writers dramatize the relations among law, justice, and freedom. Writers also show the effect of law on the fates, fortunes, and feelings of people. The course explores the power of literature to show us what the law is, what it should not be, and what it might be.

CORES-AD 05a Relationship of Government and Religion                                                        This course examines the relationship between government and religion. To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: \"Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.   This course extends over two semesters and both CORES-AD 05a and CORES-AD 05b must be completed to secure credit for the course.

To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: \"Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.   Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the political theory field. This course extends over two semesters and both semesters must be completed to secure credit for the course.

This course poses the fundamental questions: &ldquo;What is law?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What is a legal system?; and &ldquo;What is the rule of law?&rdquo; Appreciating that law reflects different cultural and historical facts, the course employs a comparative methodology in order to explore the fundamental questions from the perspective of various legal traditions. This comparative methodology considers jurisprudence from African, Chinese, Hindu, Marxist, Islamic, Southeast Asian, and Western legal traditions. In relation to these diverse legal traditions, the course examines the topics of natural law, legal positivism, interpretivism, legal realism, justice, human rights, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, critical race theory, and post-modernist jurisprudence.

We read foundational works from philosophy, sociology, political science, and law to explore why states punish, how they punish, and whom they punish. We focus on the modern American approach to punishment, including its use of mass incarceration and the death penalty. We analyze U.S. Supreme Court cases in light of the fundamental purposes of punishment, and compare penal practices around the world. Though subject to change, activities outside the classroom may include attending arraignment court, observing a sentencing hearing, and visiting a correctional facility.

Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 213 Climate Change Law and Policy                                             Climate change will be a foremost theme that will influence financial activities, and policy and legal framework for years to come. In a noticeably short time span, climate change has become a global challenge calling for collective action. Climate change law is emerging as a new legal discipline. Students in this course will explore how climate change law relates to other areas of law and how climate change has elicited rulemaking process at the international, regional, national and local levels. The course will encourage students to identify the climate change policy issues in state and international laws. Students will also study how international law and international relations influence current national laws and policies. The class will be invited to study the negotiation process, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun and Durban Agreements. The class will then proceed to evaluate the various legal tools that are available at national and international level to address climate change, including cap-and-trade, carbon taxation, command-and-control regulation, litigation, securities disclosures, and voluntary actions. The class will also examine energy and climate change nexus and the roles of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and carbon capture and sequestration. The course will pay special attention to the role of developing countries in the emerging international climate change regime and negotiation strategies of G77+China in Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Doha, Warsaw, and upcoming UNFCCC conference in Peru in December 2014.

This course will invite students to explore the legal systems of other than their own native legal system. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic and Sharia. The class will also examine the diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines, successfully used by billions of people in various parts of the world. This course will pay special attention to law traditions explicitly functioning in United States of America, and United Arab Emirates. This class will offer a historical and cultural background related to the development of legal structures and substantive rules in both territories. Students will study existing judicial systems, and essential rules dealing with legal education and practice in U.S. and Emirates.

The changing nature and media of contemporary globalized lawyering, and web-based access to what were traditionally arcane written sources of law, also renders a multi-media approach to the syllabus desirable. Reported cases will be mixed with film, television, and web-based depictions of legal norms. The course will examine the history, philosophy, method and disciplines of civil and common law. The course will provide students with a critical understanding of legal concepts, an introduction to the divisions of legal doctrine and an understanding of the most pressing issues facing the profession and governments today.

Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. We also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, we will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today. The course will include field trips around Buenos Aires and guest speakers with direct experience in the human rights movement in Argentina.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

SRPP-AD 142 Renewable Energy Law and Policy                                                                              Energy&rsquo;s role in global climate change is increasing its importance. This course focuses on two major and interrelated themes: climate change and energy. The class will look at implications of new climate change and renewable energy mandates for the electric power sector. Energy is considered a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty alleviation. Electricity demand almost doubled from 1990 to 2011, and is projected to grow 81% from 2011 to 2035 in the existing policies scenario. Over 70% of the increased energy demand is from developing countries. At this time some two billion people (one third of world&rsquo;s population) have no access to electricity. Population growth (United Nations predicts world population growth from 6.7 billion in 2011 to 8.7 billion by 2035) and increasing standards of living (the UN Population Division projects 70 % people will be living in urban areas by 2050) for many people in developing countries will cause enormous growth in energy demand. Many poorer countries lack this essential capacity. Meeting the energy needs of developing countries without compromising the environment is a challenge. Advancement of innovative energy solutions and implementation of smart policies to make the transition to clean energy in ways that fulfill growing needs and improve economy without hurting environment is very much needed. This introductory level course on renewable energy examines the historical and legal origins of energy regulations and emerging policies. The course provides an introduction to the renewable sources and basic terms and concepts, regulatory trends and other emerging issues. The primary focus of the course will be on renewable energy policies and laws of the developing countries. We will spend considerable time with Africa, Small Island States, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and examples from other countries. The centerpiece of this course is to focus on a specific renewable energy project (in a developing country) completed with international cooperation and assistance. The course will also focus on global institutions and policymaking, the divide between industrialized countries and developing countries, the nexus between global climate change and renewable energy, sustainable energy sources, and challenges that global policymakers will face in future. The course will look at the wide variety of local and regional laws, regulatory techniques, and policy objects. The class will embark on a week- long trip to a developing country to study renewable energy project and to get hands-on experience of power generation from a renewable energy facility.    * Note: This course will be counted towards a Political Science elective (International Politics) only for Spring 2015.
