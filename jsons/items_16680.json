Students should check the course requirements of individual schools that they are applying to by using the Applicant Toolkit on AAMC\u2019s website (the link can be found at the Helpful Websites section below) and individual health program\u2019s websites.   Many students take the MCAT in their junior year. Students who intend to matriculate into medical school directly following their undergraduate graduation should plan to take the MCAT\u00a0 the winter or spring term preceding a summer application.   Prior to their junior year, students are recommended to gain some practical experience by volunteering in a clinical setting and to demonstrate a commitment to service and humanistic endeavors. Building a portfolio of relevant experiences can be essential to students\u2019 medical school applications.   The Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section is a newly added section on the MCAT 2015. If students are unable to take a formal course in introductory psychology or introductory sociology (or medical sociology), AAMC is recommending students to use free online learning resources, such as Kahn Academy's MCAT tools and the MedEd Portal , to study the material on their own.

GE has been involved in China for over one hundred years and has played a pivotal role in innovating greener and cleaner solutions to address the country\u2019s energy needs. Other than creating solutions to China\u2019s energy demands, GE has focused\u00a0on areas such as healthcare and medical research in order to improve the efficiency and lower the cost of medical treatment in China.   Visiting this center allowed students to see technology that has been developed to\u00a0address\u00a0these issues in China and will hopefully inspire them to use their science education toward\u00a0innovating new solutions for future problems.   \u00a0   For their second field trip to Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park\u00a0on\u00a0December 5,\u00a0 FoS students, faculty, and staff visited the National Center for Protein Science Shanghai (NCPSS). Recently completed in 2013, this research center's primary focus areas include the decoding and maintenance of genetic information, biological processes across membranes, non-coding RNA-protein interaction and molecular mechanisms, and techniques in the discipline of supramolecular chemistry. For most students, this trip was their first exposure to large-scale protein production, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and laser and electron microscopy.   If pursuing a career in the biology field of protein science, it is possible that\u00a0students will one day use these instruments in conducting cutting-edge research. This is also a good opportunity to build further collaboration on research for faculty and staff.   Often coined the \"Silicon Valley of China,\" Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park is most known for its inclusion of companies such as GE, Intel, Sony, eBay, IBM, and Citibank. As the trips provided exposure to such high-level industry and research institutions, students expressed a rejuvenated interest in the life sciences, stimulated by the trip's tours.\u00a0 With an open mind and an open future, this budding interest can develop into the pursuit of significant research and a promising career.

Specific medical schools may have additional requirements or modifications to those listed here.   Foundations of Science is a rigorous three-semester integrated course that covers the fundamentals of basic science. It covers the premedical or prehealth requirements of one year of general biology, one year of general chemistry, one year of general physics, and one year of lab work in each of those areas. NYU Shanghai transcripts clearly note biology, chemistry, and physics as distinct parts of Foundations of Science.   Students can use literature and writing courses at NYU Shanghai to fulfill the writing course requirements. The writing courses cannnot be creative writing, but need to focus on writing or interpreting advanced texts. Students can also taking writing courses at NYU\u2019s global academic centers.   All the courses mentioned above are offered at NYU's campus in New York City in all semesters. Courses offered at NYU\u2019s global locations can be found here . Please note that they are subject to change from semester to semester.   The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) states that: \u201cIn general, most medical schools will expect applicants to have taken the Medical College Admission Test\u00ae (MCAT\u00ae), and to have completed the following types of courses: one year of biology, one year of physics, one year of English, and two years of chemistry (through organic chemistry),\u201d it is common that medical schools will include biochemistry, calculus, psychology, and sociology as their required or recommended courses.   Students should check the course requirements of individual schools that they are applying to by using the Applicant Toolkit on AAMC\u2019s website (the link can be found at the Helpful Websites section below) and individual health program\u2019s websites.   Many students take the MCAT in their junior year. Students who intend to matriculate into medical school directly following their undergraduate graduation should plan to take the MCAT\u00a0 the winter or spring term preceding a summer application.   Prior to their junior year, students are recommended to gain some practical experience by volunteering in a clinical setting and to demonstrate a commitment to service and humanistic endeavors. Building a portfolio of relevant experiences can be essential to students\u2019 medical school applications.   The Psychological, Social, and Biological Foundations of Behavior section is a newly added section on the MCAT 2015. If students are unable to take a formal course in introductory psychology or introductory sociology (or medical sociology), AAMC is recommending students to use free online learning resources, such as Kahn Academy's MCAT tools and the MedEd Portal , to study the material on their own.   Financial assistance for medical schools can be very limited and even more difficult for non-US citizen or permanent resident students.   Students can find more information on practical prehealth opportunities and options for MCAT Preparation on NYU Shanghai Career Development Center 's OrgSync portal here .

GE has been involved in China for over one hundred years and has played a pivotal role in innovating greener and cleaner solutions to address the country\u2019s energy needs. Other than creating solutions to China\u2019s energy demands, GE has focused\u00a0on areas such as healthcare and medical research in order to improve the efficiency and lower the cost of medical treatment in China.   Visiting this center allowed students to see technology that has been developed to\u00a0address\u00a0these issues in China and will hopefully inspire them to use their science education toward\u00a0innovating new solutions for future problems.   \u00a0   For their second field trip to Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park\u00a0on\u00a0December 5,\u00a0 FoS students, faculty, and staff visited the National Center for Protein Science Shanghai (NCPSS). Recently completed in 2013, this research center's primary focus areas include the decoding and maintenance of genetic information, biological processes across membranes, non-coding RNA-protein interaction and molecular mechanisms, and techniques in the discipline of supramolecular chemistry. For most students, this trip was their first exposure to large-scale protein production, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and laser and electron microscopy.   If pursuing a career in the biology field of protein science, it is possible that\u00a0students will one day use these instruments in conducting cutting-edge research. This is also a good opportunity to build further collaboration on research for faculty and staff.   Often coined the \"Silicon Valley of China,\" Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park is most known for its inclusion of companies such as GE, Intel, Sony, eBay, IBM, and Citibank. As the trips provided exposure to such high-level industry and research institutions, students expressed a rejuvenated interest in the life sciences, stimulated by the trip's tours.\u00a0 With an open mind and an open future, this budding interest can develop into the pursuit of significant research and a promising career.
