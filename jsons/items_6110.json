The epigenetic continuum from risk and resiliency factors to symptom expression, manifestation of illness, and models of recovery is explored. Theories and research related to the etiology, assessment, differential diagnosis, case conceptualization, treatment, and evaluation of client outcomes are examined. Models for prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders are explored for their efficacy in working with adults, older adults, and families, paying specific attention to diversity in culture, lifestyle and values. Aspects of the psychiatric nurse practitioner role are demonstrated within a framework of critical thinking, diagnostic reasoning and clinical judgment to develop and evaluate comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and evidence-based treatment plans.
