We strive to meet each childbearing family\u2019s needs during a life changing moment. Whether as a low-risk laboring or a high-risk patient needing surgical care, each patient is treated individually by our interdisciplinary team.\u00a0     As a Magnet and Baby-Friendly designated hospital, we make every effort to stay current in the evidence-based care every woman deserves to receive. We offer a full range of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting preparation classes to ensure families will find complete perinatal care through NYU Langone Medical Center. Additionally, our use of the Centricity Perinatal fetal surveillance and documentation system enables team members to closely monitor all our patients during their hospital stay.\u00a0     Having completed a unit-based team training program, we have used the team building process to create a unit dedicated to patient safety through the implementation of policies and emergency response teams. Our staff is educated through the use of simulation to deliver rapid response in emergency situations. While the demands of a fast paced environment are many, staff feels richly rewarded with each new birth of a baby. Come and join us where miracles still happen on 34th Street.
