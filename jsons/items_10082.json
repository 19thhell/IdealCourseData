We take pride in our ability to teach modern methods for analyzing and explaining political events.    We offer courses in the fields of Political Theory, Analytical Politics, American Politics, Comparative Politics, and International Politics. For Pre-Law students we offer several courses, including American Constitution, International Law, Law and Society and Politics of Administrative Law.    Our faculty has expertise in the politics of a wide range of countries, and regularly offers courses on Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa, Russia, India and China. Additionally, should you want to extend your knowledge of a particular country, NYU Study Abroad offers you the opportunity to spend a semester or a year abroad in many locations throughout the world. NYU study abroad sites offer a wide variety of courses in politics.    We also have faculty who specialize in the politics of the United States. Our recently launched track in American Political Practice and Leadership recognizes students who gain skills in applied American politics via a study-away semester at NYU-Washington DC , while acquiring the substantive, analytical understanding of U.S. politics provided by American politics courses offered at NYU Washington Square.    Should you want to deepen your knowledge even further, the department offers an honors program through which you may work individually with a faculty member in researching and writing an honors thesis on the topic of your choice.    Graduates of the Department of Politics have gone on to accept positions with governments, international finance groups, multinational corporations, law firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other institutions. Graduates have also attended law school and graduate programs in international affairs, campaign management, public policy, and political science at highly competitive universities.    We would be delighted to answer any questions you may have. Please contact us at politics.undergrads@nyu.edu .
