Brown   In the early 19th century, the rapid growth of new industries and employment opportunities emphasized the special need for higher education. In New York City civic and religious leaders began meeting in December of 1829 to launch a new educational institution. Their efforts eventually led to the founding of the University of the City of New York, incorporated on April 18, 1831.(1) The founders took great pride in the University's liberal approach to education hoping it would extend its benefits \"in greater abundance and variety&#8230; to larger numbers of young persons, who form the rising hope of our country.\"(2) Yet, during its formative years, the University primarily served young men seeking careers in law, education or medicine. Women, consigned to a \"separate sphere of influence,\" had fewer choices regarding education. However, in the final decades of the century, organizational strategies helped them gain equal footing. This important chapter in NYU's long history is well documented in the University archives.   Early Pioneers of Change   Rev. Howard B. Crosby  (1826-1891), a Presbyterian minister and fourth Chancellor of the University from 1870-1881, publicly advocated coeducation. His stance led to the involvement of the New York chapter of Sorosis, a national women's club. According to Sorosis founder Jane Cunningham Croly (1829-1901), a suffragist, popular journalist, and magazine editor who wrote under the pseudonym \"Jennie June,\" their mission was to elevate the social and professional status of women. Other notable members of Sorosis included Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta (1815-1891), a teacher, poet and artist married to University professor Vincent Botta.   In 1876, a few years after several women had been admitted to the School of Art, Ms. Croly organized a petition drive to get University officials to admit women to all schools. Additional support came from the Eucleian Society , a literary organization headquartered in the old University Building. The Society frequently debated the intellect of women and published a resolution in support of their admission. Eventually, the University's governing council amended their policies toward women. In response, Rev. Crosby published the essay \"Coeducation,\" stating his wish to see \"young men and women on the same benches at the same time, receiving the same intellectual discipline in the humanities and sciences.\"(3)   Additional victories took place in 1888-89, when Mary B. Dennis became the first woman to gain admission to the University's Graduate School of Arts and Science. In 1890, the Women's Law Class and the Women's Legal Education Society was founded to provide women with legal knowledge, \"in order to better protect their rights.\"(4) Henry M. MacCracken , the University's sixth Chancellor from 1891-1910, was also a staunch advocate of coeducation and allowed the Society to administer the law class. The University sponsored the lectures. Prominent members of the Society included Margaret Sage, Helen Miller Gould, and Margaret Buell Munn who with other Society members developed twelve full and twenty part-time scholarships.(5)   Dr.Emily Kempin,  a graduate of the Zurich Law School, has been credited with the formation and the success of the University's first woman's law class, held on October 30, 1890. Prior to teaching the class, she had been permitted to attend legal lectures with men in 1888 and taught Roman law to unreceptive male students.(6) Along with Mrs. Fanny B. Webber, Dr. Kempin had also founded a legal aid society to aid the poor.(7) Three women were enrolled in the first class, graduating in 1892. The same year, Ms. Dennis became the first woman to receive a Ph.D from the University. A 1893 law school graduate, Stanleyetta Titus, became the first woman to be admitted to the New York State Bar.   After Dr. Kempin left the University at the end of the 1890-91 to accept a teaching post in Switzerland, Professor Isaac Franklin Russell,  a prominent lawyer who received his B.A. (1875) and M.A. (1879) from the University, took over the position. For more than a decade, he developed and improved the class curriculum and his lectures were compiled and published as Outline Study of the Law .(8)    The accomplishments of the law school led to other critical developments. In 1890, formation of The Women's Advisory Committee, (WAC) was authorized by the University Council. The primary task of the WAC was \"to prepare for [the Council's] consideration plans and recommendations for the advancement of the University's work for women.\" The rationale for this decision was explained by Bayrd Still, former University professor of history and its first archivist, \"It was deemed expedient to have the cooperation of representative women interested in the promotion of University work in the most advanced lines of study and investigation.\"(9) Over the next 30 years, WAC developed the School of Pedagogy, one of the first in the nation.(10)   Scholarships provided by WAC members also helped increase the number of women enrollees. Mrs. Martha Buell Plum Munn, (1856-1926) and her family were among the largest contributors to this cause and assisted in the University's educational development as well. Her daughter, Aristine Munn-Recht served as the first Dean of Women at Washington Square College (WSC) from 1917 to the early 1920s and her son, James Buell Munn  (1890-1967), served as Dean of WSC from 1928 to 1932.   Helen Miller Gould  also joined WAC in 1894, providing numerous scholarships for the School of Pedagogy. Ms. Gould was equally generous in other respects. Continuing her father's earlier financial support of the University, she and her brother Frank financed the opening of the University Heights Bronx campus , the building of the University's Hall of Fame and the Gould Library. Ironically, these financial gifts, which totaled more than $2 million, did nothing to alter the restrictions placed on women's attendance at \"The Heights.\"(11) Until 1959, women were only allowed to attend summer sessions.   Although women were admitted to the University in incremental stages, the strength of their pioneering efforts can be measured by the number of female graduates, faculty members and administrators who have distinguished themselves in music, education, law and medicine. The following profiles are only a few of the archival records that document the success of women at NYU.   NYU Profiles   The Marion Eugenie Bauer Papers MC 3   Marion Eugenie Bauer  (1887-1955) was the first woman faculty member to join the Music Department at Washington Square College. Educated at St. Helen's Hall in Portland, Oregon, she studied under several famous musicians and received a Master of Arts (hon.) from Whitman College in 1932, and Doctor of Music degree (hon.) from the New York College of Music in 1951. Initially, she held the position of Instructor in Music from 1926 to 1928 at Washington Square College. In 1928, she was appointed Assistant Professor of Music, a title she maintained until 1930, when she became an Associate Professor. Ms. Bauer was a member of the Society of American Women Composers and served as a lecturer, editor, critic and writer. She retired from New York University in August 1951.   The Lillian Herlands Hornstein Papers MC 140   The Lillian Herlands Hornstein Papers (1909 - 1999) detail the career of an NYU \"professor of distinction.\" Ms. Hornstein entered Washington Square College as a student in 1925 where she received her BS (1929), MA (1930) and Ph.D. (1940). She remained at NYU where she began her teaching career as a graduate assistant. By 1959, she had become a full professor and taught Medieval English Literature until her retirement in 1974. As a Chaucerian and English scholar, the Hornstein Collection reflects her personal professional interest in research and includes correspondence, bibliographical indexes, manuscripts, papers and articles pertaining to Chaucer, medieval studies and linguistics.   The Dorothy McSparran Arnold Papers RG 19.3   Several administrators contributed to the development of NYU's services for women. Dorothy McSparran Arnold (d.1971) graduated from Cornell University in 1918. In 1924, she taught as an English professor at Washington Square College, which already had a solid reputation for women's undergraduate education. By 1925, she had become a counselor of student affairs for women students. Several years later, the Council appointed Mrs. Arnold Assistant Dean. She continued in this role until November of 1948 when she became Dean of Women, reporting directly to the Dean of Washington Square College until her retirement in 1961. As an Advisor and Dean, Mrs. Arnold was concerned with promoting the welfare of women students. She provided a sense of continuity, structure and assisted in the development of new programs for women. In addition, she served as an active advisor to most of the women's organizations on campus and helped coordinate many of the activities of the League of Women, women's honorary and social societies and women's athletics.   The Arnold records contain important material on women's organizations at NYU such as the League of Women and the Eclectic Society records spanning some thirty years (1920's-50's). Information highlighting the constant struggle that Dean Arnold waged to gain funding for adequate facilities and programs for women, annual reports, and the American Association of University Women and Mortar Board files are also valuable additions to the collection. Arnold's files on the cases of two New York University victims of the 50's political paranoia, Edwin Berry Burgum and Lyman R. Bradley are also of great interest. Burgum, a tenured member of the English department was dismissed by the Chancellor after refusing to testify before the McCarran Committee in 1952. Bradley, convicted of contempt for refusing to surrender the records of Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee to the House committee, was temporarily suspended and removed from the chairmanship of the German department. Photographs are filed within appropriate folders.   Washington Square College: Counselor to Women Students-Dorothea Berger Records:1952-1966 RG 19.4   The Berger Papers (1952-1966) detail Dorothea Berger's role as an administrative counselor focusing on women's interests. Although many of her records duplicate, overlap, and seem to incorporate some of Arnold's Papers files, noteworthy files include her work with Judson Residence, University Christian Foundation, Association of Women Students, Loeb Student Center, Gamma Gamma Sigma, Parker, Pan-Hellenic and Junior Advisors folders. The Berger papers and Arnold papers should be regarded as complementary collections.   The Alice Keliher Papers -- MC 139   In the field of education, Alice Keliher (1903-1995) became one of the University's most devoted champions of early educational development. A former neighbor and close friend of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, they both shared a commitment to human rights. Over the course of her professional career, Ms. Keliher served as Director of Child and Youth services for the New York Office of Civil Defense, secretary for Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia's Committee for Wartime Care of Children and taught at NYU for more than two decades.

Brown   In the early 19th century, the rapid growth of new industries and employment opportunities emphasized the special need for higher education. In New York City civic and religious leaders began meeting in December of 1829 to launch a new educational institution. Their efforts eventually led to the founding of the University of the City of New York, incorporated on April 18, 1831.(1) The founders took great pride in the University's liberal approach to education hoping it would extend its benefits \"in greater abundance and variety&#8230; to larger numbers of young persons, who form the rising hope of our country.\"(2) Yet, during its formative years, the University primarily served young men seeking careers in law, education or medicine. Women, consigned to a \"separate sphere of influence,\" had fewer choices regarding education. However, in the final decades of the century, organizational strategies helped them gain equal footing. This important chapter in NYU's long history is well documented in the University archives.   Early Pioneers of Change   Rev. Howard B. Crosby  (1826-1891), a Presbyterian minister and fourth Chancellor of the University from 1870-1881, publicly advocated coeducation. His stance led to the involvement of the New York chapter of Sorosis, a national women's club. According to Sorosis founder Jane Cunningham Croly (1829-1901), a suffragist, popular journalist, and magazine editor who wrote under the pseudonym \"Jennie June,\" their mission was to elevate the social and professional status of women. Other notable members of Sorosis included Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta (1815-1891), a teacher, poet and artist married to University professor Vincent Botta.   In 1876, a few years after several women had been admitted to the School of Art, Ms. Croly organized a petition drive to get University officials to admit women to all schools. Additional support came from the Eucleian Society , a literary organization headquartered in the old University Building. The Society frequently debated the intellect of women and published a resolution in support of their admission. Eventually, the University's governing council amended their policies toward women. In response, Rev. Crosby published the essay \"Coeducation,\" stating his wish to see \"young men and women on the same benches at the same time, receiving the same intellectual discipline in the humanities and sciences.\"(3)   Additional victories took place in 1888-89, when Mary B. Dennis became the first woman to gain admission to the University's Graduate School of Arts and Science. In 1890, the Women's Law Class and the Women's Legal Education Society was founded to provide women with legal knowledge, \"in order to better protect their rights.\"(4) Henry M. MacCracken , the University's sixth Chancellor from 1891-1910, was also a staunch advocate of coeducation and allowed the Society to administer the law class. The University sponsored the lectures. Prominent members of the Society included Margaret Sage, Helen Miller Gould, and Margaret Buell Munn who with other Society members developed twelve full and twenty part-time scholarships.(5)   Dr.Emily Kempin,  a graduate of the Zurich Law School, has been credited with the formation and the success of the University's first woman's law class, held on October 30, 1890. Prior to teaching the class, she had been permitted to attend legal lectures with men in 1888 and taught Roman law to unreceptive male students.(6) Along with Mrs. Fanny B. Webber, Dr. Kempin had also founded a legal aid society to aid the poor.(7) Three women were enrolled in the first class, graduating in 1892. The same year, Ms. Dennis became the first woman to receive a Ph.D from the University. A 1893 law school graduate, Stanleyetta Titus, became the first woman to be admitted to the New York State Bar.   After Dr. Kempin left the University at the end of the 1890-91 to accept a teaching post in Switzerland, Professor Isaac Franklin Russell,  a prominent lawyer who received his B.A. (1875) and M.A. (1879) from the University, took over the position. For more than a decade, he developed and improved the class curriculum and his lectures were compiled and published as Outline Study of the Law .(8)    The accomplishments of the law school led to other critical developments. In 1890, formation of The Women's Advisory Committee, (WAC) was authorized by the University Council. The primary task of the WAC was \"to prepare for [the Council's] consideration plans and recommendations for the advancement of the University's work for women.\" The rationale for this decision was explained by Bayrd Still, former University professor of history and its first archivist, \"It was deemed expedient to have the cooperation of representative women interested in the promotion of University work in the most advanced lines of study and investigation.\"(9) Over the next 30 years, WAC developed the School of Pedagogy, one of the first in the nation.(10)   Scholarships provided by WAC members also helped increase the number of women enrollees. Mrs. Martha Buell Plum Munn, (1856-1926) and her family were among the largest contributors to this cause and assisted in the University's educational development as well. Her daughter, Aristine Munn-Recht served as the first Dean of Women at Washington Square College (WSC) from 1917 to the early 1920s and her son, James Buell Munn  (1890-1967), served as Dean of WSC from 1928 to 1932.   Helen Miller Gould  also joined WAC in 1894, providing numerous scholarships for the School of Pedagogy. Ms. Gould was equally generous in other respects. Continuing her father's earlier financial support of the University, she and her brother Frank financed the opening of the University Heights Bronx campus , the building of the University's Hall of Fame and the Gould Library. Ironically, these financial gifts, which totaled more than $2 million, did nothing to alter the restrictions placed on women's attendance at \"The Heights.\"(11) Until 1959, women were only allowed to attend summer sessions.   Although women were admitted to the University in incremental stages, the strength of their pioneering efforts can be measured by the number of female graduates, faculty members and administrators who have distinguished themselves in music, education, law and medicine. The following profiles are only a few of the archival records that document the success of women at NYU.   NYU Profiles   The Marion Eugenie Bauer Papers MC 3   Marion Eugenie Bauer  (1887-1955) was the first woman faculty member to join the Music Department at Washington Square College. Educated at St. Helen's Hall in Portland, Oregon, she studied under several famous musicians and received a Master of Arts (hon.) from Whitman College in 1932, and Doctor of Music degree (hon.) from the New York College of Music in 1951. Initially, she held the position of Instructor in Music from 1926 to 1928 at Washington Square College. In 1928, she was appointed Assistant Professor of Music, a title she maintained until 1930, when she became an Associate Professor. Ms. Bauer was a member of the Society of American Women Composers and served as a lecturer, editor, critic and writer. She retired from New York University in August 1951.   The Lillian Herlands Hornstein Papers MC 140   The Lillian Herlands Hornstein Papers (1909 - 1999) detail the career of an NYU \"professor of distinction.\" Ms. Hornstein entered Washington Square College as a student in 1925 where she received her BS (1929), MA (1930) and Ph.D. (1940). She remained at NYU where she began her teaching career as a graduate assistant. By 1959, she had become a full professor and taught Medieval English Literature until her retirement in 1974. As a Chaucerian and English scholar, the Hornstein Collection reflects her personal professional interest in research and includes correspondence, bibliographical indexes, manuscripts, papers and articles pertaining to Chaucer, medieval studies and linguistics.   The Dorothy McSparran Arnold Papers RG 19.3   Several administrators contributed to the development of NYU's services for women. Dorothy McSparran Arnold (d.1971) graduated from Cornell University in 1918. In 1924, she taught as an English professor at Washington Square College, which already had a solid reputation for women's undergraduate education. By 1925, she had become a counselor of student affairs for women students. Several years later, the Council appointed Mrs. Arnold Assistant Dean. She continued in this role until November of 1948 when she became Dean of Women, reporting directly to the Dean of Washington Square College until her retirement in 1961. As an Advisor and Dean, Mrs. Arnold was concerned with promoting the welfare of women students. She provided a sense of continuity, structure and assisted in the development of new programs for women. In addition, she served as an active advisor to most of the women's organizations on campus and helped coordinate many of the activities of the League of Women, women's honorary and social societies and women's athletics.   The Arnold records contain important material on women's organizations at NYU such as the League of Women and the Eclectic Society records spanning some thirty years (1920's-50's). Information highlighting the constant struggle that Dean Arnold waged to gain funding for adequate facilities and programs for women, annual reports, and the American Association of University Women and Mortar Board files are also valuable additions to the collection. Arnold's files on the cases of two New York University victims of the 50's political paranoia, Edwin Berry Burgum and Lyman R. Bradley are also of great interest. Burgum, a tenured member of the English department was dismissed by the Chancellor after refusing to testify before the McCarran Committee in 1952. Bradley, convicted of contempt for refusing to surrender the records of Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee to the House committee, was temporarily suspended and removed from the chairmanship of the German department. Photographs are filed within appropriate folders.   Washington Square College: Counselor to Women Students-Dorothea Berger Records:1952-1966 RG 19.4   The Berger Papers (1952-1966) detail Dorothea Berger's role as an administrative counselor focusing on women's interests. Although many of her records duplicate, overlap, and seem to incorporate some of Arnold's Papers files, noteworthy files include her work with Judson Residence, University Christian Foundation, Association of Women Students, Loeb Student Center, Gamma Gamma Sigma, Parker, Pan-Hellenic and Junior Advisors folders. The Berger papers and Arnold papers should be regarded as complementary collections.   The Alice Keliher Papers -- MC 139   In the field of education, Alice Keliher (1903-1995) became one of the University's most devoted champions of early educational development. A former neighbor and close friend of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, they both shared a commitment to human rights. Over the course of her professional career, Ms. Keliher served as Director of Child and Youth services for the New York Office of Civil Defense, secretary for Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia's Committee for Wartime Care of Children and taught at NYU for more than two decades.

Undergraduates from NYU-Poly and Abu Dhabi can use the same application form: WINS 2015 Application      Featured Women in Science    NYU Female Social Scientist of the Month: Chiye Aoki    WINS Profile:      Dr. Chiye Aoki is a NYU Professor of Neural Science and Biology. She   received her PhD from the Rockefeller University while working with Dr.   Philip Siekevitz. Her work showed that there is a functional link   between neuronal activity, second messengers, and phosphorylation of a   cytoskeletal protein called MAP2 during the critical period of visual   cortex development. For her postdoctoral training, Dr. Aoki worked with   Dr. Virginia Pickel at the Department of Neurology and Neuroscience at   the Weill Cornell Medical College where she used electron microscopy to   visualize two molecules simultaneously in order to look at multiple   molecular interactions at synapses. Dr. Aoki first decided to pursue a career as a scientist during her sophomore year of college. Having gone to a school where there were opportunities for small research-based courses, it was in a class taught by a successful female faculty that she had her first experience learning how to formulate a hypothesis, testing it, and reforming it. The following year during the summer before her junior year she volunteered in the lab of a scientist who left the field of business in order to explore the human psyche, her first experience in a neuroscience lab that left her hooked. From then on, it was straight forward: applying to graduate and finding the one that would support her questions of interest involving the neurobiological basis of individual differences. Though her PhD took 6 years, she had the valuable experience of pioneering this field of neuroscience. During this time, she also published a Scientific American article on the critical period of development and felt that she found a niche of neuroscience that was hers.      When asked about female inspirations, Dr. Aoki claimed that her grandmother was a strong role model for her. She had always seen her with a tape measurer around her neck and admired her mathematical mind and skill in making clothes. She also developed a mutually beneficial relationship with Dr. Pickel, her advisor during her postdoc, who supported her research and promoted her ascension to becoming an Assistant Professor. In general, Dr. Aoki claims to have been lucky to have great mentorship, which plays an important role in scientific success. She had mentors that gave her the perfect balance of freedom and support, including Nobel Prize winner Torsten Wiesel, who advised her to make herself marketable by learning a technique that no one else can do in order to stay at the edge of the frontier. IN her case, this technique was dual immuno-electron microscopy.        Before coming to NYU, Dr. Aoki had taught Chemical Neuroanatomy at Cornell and was a student in the course, Neurobiology, at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. These experiences helped her form the class that she teaches at NYU: Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (CMN). For the longest time she had been the only NYU faculty member with a neurochemistry background to teach that part in CMN. In the past, she taught a special topics course on synaptogenesis and would, in the future, like to offer another special topics course called Adolescence as a Critical Period for Plasticity.      On top of her duties to NYU as a professor, Dr. Aoki is also one of the directors of the BP-ENDURE program. She initiated this program at NYU when she wanted to expand NYU\u2019s research opportunities to actual NYU students, which had been previously been funded by NSF but was limited to students outside of NYU in order spread the wealth to students from smaller colleges and underrepresented backgrounds. She had been twice denied funding for this under the rationale that NYU was a wealthy place and the underrepresented population was just not big enough. When applying for funding for the program the third time, she teamed up with Hunter College and this time successfully received funding for what is now the BP-ENDURE program. This is an NIH-funded program supporting Hunter and NYU students from underrepresented backgrounds to do neuroscience research and pursue a PhD in the field.      Here are some of Dr. Aoki\u2019s words of wisdom to women pursuing careers in science: \u201cA career in science is really wonderful in that for most situations there is a great deal of flexibility. Whatever you want to do\u2026 all paths are available. Regardless of what it is said about women in science, and science in general, I think women in science should go forth without any hesitation, without any worry about what is going to happen, disregarding what is going on in the news. Just remember that in the moments where you are still in the lab at midnight questioning your motives, I feel that the way I survived was by making sure my personal life was happy and healthy.\u201d      WINS would like to thank Dr. Aoki for giving our Fall 2014 Lecture titled \u201cThe Neurobiological Basis for Individuality in Coping Mechanisms of Stress.\u201d                              Home     About Us       People       News &amp; Events       Awards &amp; Grants       Resources       Contact Us                          Stay Connected           Blog       Facebook       Twitter       LinkedIn             Contact Us"}]}]
