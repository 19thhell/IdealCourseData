Please click on the title or cover image below for further information about that volume.      Making the Irish American: History &amp; Heritage of the Irish in the United States      Edited by J.J. Lee and Marion R. Casey NYU Press , 736 pages, 70 illustrations    ISBN 081475208X (cloth, publication date: 2/1/2006)    ISBN 0814752187 (paperback, release date: 3/1/2007)      In Making the Irish American , J. J. Lee and Marion R. Casey offer a feast of twenty-nine perspectives on the turbulent, vital, endlessly fascinating story of the Irish in America. Combining original research with reprints of classic works, these essays and articles extend far beyond a survey to offer a truly rich understanding of the Irish immigrant impact on America, and America's impact on the Irish immigrant.                John Devoy's Catalpa Expedition      Edited by Philip Fennell and Marie King, introduction by Terry Golway NYU Press , 272 pages ISBN 0814727484, Cloth, Publication date: 2/1/2006      The story of John Devoy's 1876 Catalpa rescue is a tale of heroism, creativity, and the triumph of independent spirit in pursuit of freedom. The daily log on board the whaling ship Catalpa begins with the typical recount of a crew intact and a spirit unfettered, but such quiet words deceive the truth of the audacious enterprise that came to be known as one of the most important rescues in Irish-American history. John Devoy's men rescued six Irish political prisoners from the Australian coast, allowing millions of fellow Irishmen and American-Fenians, many of whom secretly financed the dangerous plot, to draw courage from the newly exiled prisoners.                    Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History      by Hugh F. Kearney   NYU Press , 368 pages    ISBN 0814748007, Cloth, Publication Date: 4/1/2007      What is the Irish nation? Who is included in it? Are its borders delimited by religion, ethnicity, language, or civic commitment? And how should we teach its history? These and other questions are carefully considered by distinguished historian Hugh F. Kearney in Ireland: Contested Ideas of Nationalism and History .      The insightful essays collected here all circle around Ireland, with the first section attending to questions of nationalism and the second addressing pivotal moments in the history and historiography of the isle. Kearney contends that Ireland represents a striking example of the power of nationalism, which, while unique in many ways, provides an illuminating case study for students of the modern world. He goes on to elaborate his revisionist \"four nations\" approach to Irish history.                                  &Aacute;ras Glucksman na h&Eacute;ireann                      Ollscoil Nua Eabhrac                  Glucksman Ireland House                  New York University                  One Washington Mews                  New York, NY 10003                  U.S.A.
