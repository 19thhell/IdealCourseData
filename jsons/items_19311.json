Genetically modified crops allow feed quickly growing populations, while novel therapies, such as artificial organs, extend life. Biomolecular scientists also address ecological issues -- such as producing cheap energy from renewable sources (like producing oil from algae), while others clean the environment through bioremediation. A BS in Biomolecular Science is also a suitable starting point for careers in medicine. Our program was developed in cooperation with deans from major medical schools, and graduates have gone on to Harvard Dental School, Mount Sinai Medical School, and NYU Medical School, among other medical programs. Our BS program in Biomolecular Science lets you join in their efforts to improve the world. The first 2 years of the program focus on core courses so you have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of the science \u2014 math, physics, chemistry, and biology. From there, you can concentrate your studies in biomedical science, biotechnology, or chemistry. BS/MS Program Prospective students with superior admission qualifications may be selected to participate in our BS/MS Program, which lets you earn 2 degrees at once -- a BS in Biomolecular Science and a MS in Bioinformatics or Biotechnology. Depending on your preparation and goals, you can complete both degrees in as little as 4 years. Medical School Early Assurance Guaranteed Admissions Program The School of Engineering and SUNY Downstate Medical Center have created the Medical School Early Assurance Guaranteed Admissions Program, which reserves 4 slots in SUNY Downstate's first-year medical school class for graduating the School of Engineering students in the biomolecular science bachelor's progam who satisfy certain requirements. Contact the Department of Chemical and Biological Sciences for information. Once You Have the Degree Students in biomedical science can find work developing artificial organs, prosthetics, or other medical devices. Those who concentrate in biotechnology join the quickly growing field where antibiotics, vaccines, and hormones are produced through genetically based technologies. Others who focus in chemistry find employment in pharmaceutical companies or related industries, and can get them certification from the American Chemistry Society (ACS).

Genetically modified crops allow feed quickly growing populations, while novel therapies, such as artificial organs, extend life. Biomolecular scientists also address ecological issues -- such as producing cheap energy from renewable sources (like producing oil from algae), while others clean the environment through bioremediation. A BS in Biomolecular Science is also a suitable starting point for careers in medicine. Our program was developed in cooperation with deans from major medical schools, and graduates have gone on to Harvard Dental School, Mount Sinai Medical School, and NYU Medical School, among other medical programs. Our BS program in Biomolecular Science lets you join in their efforts to improve the world. The first 2 years of the program focus on core courses so you have a solid foundation in the fundamentals of the science \u2014 math, physics, chemistry, and biology. From there, you can concentrate your studies in biomedical science, biotechnology, or chemistry. BS/MS Program Prospective students with superior admission qualifications may be selected to participate in our BS/MS Program, which lets you earn 2 degrees at once -- a BS in Biomolecular Science and a MS in Bioinformatics or Biotechnology. Depending on your preparation and goals, you can complete both degrees in as little as 4 years. Medical School Early Assurance Guaranteed Admissions Program The School of Engineering and SUNY Downstate Medical Center have created the Medical School Early Assurance Guaranteed Admissions Program, which reserves 4 slots in SUNY Downstate's first-year medical school class for graduating the School of Engineering students in the biomolecular science bachelor's progam who satisfy certain requirements. Contact the Department of Chemical and Biological Sciences for information. Once You Have the Degree Students in biomedical science can find work developing artificial organs, prosthetics, or other medical devices. Those who concentrate in biotechnology join the quickly growing field where antibiotics, vaccines, and hormones are produced through genetically based technologies. Others who focus in chemistry find employment in pharmaceutical companies or related industries, and can get them certification from the American Chemistry Society (ACS).
