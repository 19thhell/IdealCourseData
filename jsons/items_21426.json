Using advanced computer software with new visualization techniques, the team transformed this motion data, tracing the intricacies of Gilbert's gestures for the Times feature \"The Maestro's Mojo.\"                                                                                                    The NYU Movement Lab's new Squidball platform &quot; crowd2cloud &quot;  will premiere at TEDx NYU on April 14, 2012. Squidball was first unveiled as the world's largest-scale motion capture game to 4,000 player audiences at SIGGRAPH 2004 , and continued all over the world, including Ars Electronica 2010, and many other venues in New York and California.                                                                                                              The NYU Movement Lab worked with The New York Times on the interactive magazine feature  Mariano Rivera, King of the Closers . The New York Times provided reference videos of several of Rivera's pitches  and the NYU Movement Lab created a 3D reconstruction of his skeletal motion. more information                                                                                    The Movement          Lab conducts reasearch with an interdisciplinary team on a new body language project called         GreenDot in     following the current US Election Candidates and many other subjects.                                                                     The Movement Lab is featured in the April 2nd issue of Business Week. The article focuses on recent developments in motion capture technology, including a new NYU project on body-language and bio-metrics and an online interview with Chris Bregler discussing several of the group's ongoing projects.

The collaboration marks the launch of a Partnership Program in which Digitas Labs, a global, tech-inspired incubator within the agency, will team up with tech start-ups and educational institutions to develop digital innovations.     The NYU Movement Lab will create a state-of-the-art 3D motion capture lab in the Digitas New York office, allowing the agency unprecedented access to leading-edge technologies. Chris Bregler, director of the NYU Movement Lab, will design the new facility. Bregler is a pioneer in the field of motion capture and has worked with the National Science Foundation, Microsoft, Google, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force, among others. In addition, his research and commercial projects have led to award-winning interactive features in sports analysis, large-scale interactive motion game experiences, and special effects systems used in Hollywood productions. This is NYU Movement Lab\u2019s first collaborative relationship with an integrated brand agency. The space is being offered to the NYU Movement Lab cost-free.      Motion Capture and the Content Revolution   \u201cThere\u2019s a revolution happening in content right now,\u201d states Colin Kinsella, CEO, Digitas North America. \u201cWe\u2019re evolving a new visual language around movement and what can be explored and navigated. The ability to incubate new, content-rich brand-related projects using 3D motion capture technology opens up a whole new lane of innovation that has, until now, only scratched the surface. We\u2019re thrilled to collaborate with the NYU Movement Lab, and having them on premises is an incredible opportunity for our teams.\u201d     Potential marketing applications for 3D motion capture technology include the creation of high-quality live-action experiences for sports and entertainment fans; new types of &quot;deep content&quot; Web search experiences; and in-store body-language kiosk applications.   \u201cThis is a very exciting opportunity for us,\u201d states Bregler. \u201cAs a top, digitally-led global agency, Digitas will allow the NYU Movement Lab to shine a bright light on motion-capture technology and its potential to enrich consumer experiences. And collocation means that our respective teams can brainstorm new ideas and directions in the moment.\u201d       Digitas Labs: Global Industry Innovator   In 2012 Digitas formalized Digitas Labs, a global initiative within the agency dedicated to exploring new and emerging technologies. The Digitas Labs global teams developed more than 100 prototypes and technology innovations worldwide in 2012, and received top honors from the Massachusetts Innovation &amp; Technology Exchange in their \u201cPhysical Computing and Robotics\u201d category for its work on the Duracell Virtual Stadium. In France, Digitas Labs Paris developed AnyTouch, a prototype that can turn any object, no matter its size or surface, into an interactive touchpad by using special software, a 3D camera and sensors. In addition, in 2012 Digitas Labs Paris joined the Paris Region Innovation Lab, giving the agency first-look access at the next generation of technology solutions for its clients.     Digitas Labs Innovation Rooms, physical spaces for clients and teams to test interactive experiences first-hand, are currently active in New York, London, and Paris, and additional rooms are slated to open in Boston, Chicago, and San Jose, Costa Rica in early 2013. Innovation rooms are equipped with emerging technologies, thereby facilitating rapid deployment of brand-specific prototypes that bring digital products to life.

About the NYU Movement Lab  The NYU Movement Lab is a motion capture studio and research group dedicated to the analysis and animation of all forms of human movement. It is housed at NYU\u2019s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and in NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts \u2019 Interactive Telecommunications Program . Many projects are at the boundary between computer science, dance, performance art, animation, medical research, and other uses of motion capture technology. The NYU Movement Lab\u2019s many activities include projects with the National Science Foundation, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, Sloan Foundation, The New York Times, Google, and Microsoft, and include a first of its kind analysis of 2012 Olympic Gold Medalist Dana Vollmer, uncovering the signature pitch of New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera, and capturing the gestures of acclaimed New York Philharmonic Conductor Alan Gilbert. It has also developed a method to identify and compare the body language of different speakers. Titled \u201cGreenDot,\u201d the project employs motion capture, pattern recognition, and \u201cIntrinsic Biometrics\u201d techniques.
