It is designed to prepare students for advanced work and teaching in American studies. The Program also offers an undergraduate major and minor. American Studies at NYU is one of the country\u2019s top-ranked programs in   this dynamic field. An interdisciplinary program housed in the   Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, it studies United States   society in national, hemispheric, and global frameworks. It draws on   faculty strength in a wide range of fields, including history, area   studies, literature and film, gender studies, critical ethnic studies,   political economy, and urban and environmental studies. The program interprets \u201cAmerican\u201d in a broad sense to include   assessments of the historical role of the United States in the Americas   and, more generally, in world affairs. Inasmuch as the program has a   regional focus, special attention is given to studies in urbanism and to   New York in particular, a global city that comprises many world   cultures. Students are exposed to a range of   methodologies in the social sciences and humanities, including   ethnography, textual analysis, archival research, and cultural studies.

Americas Scholars participate in academic seminars and cultural activities with Gallatin faculty members.        Group Meetings and Activities   Throughout the academic year, Americas Scholars explore a particular theme through bi-weekly evening meetings. The majority of Americas Scholars activities will take place during this time, although some activities such as dinners and performances may occur at other times.   Examples of Americas Scholars activities:     Attending lectures and readings on topics related to the Americas   Visits to museums, dance performances, musical performances, and other cultural events   Independent research and collaborative group projects          International and Domestic Travel   The Americas Scholars investigate their yearly theme by traveling as a group during January to an international or domestic location. Group members prepare a project based on their explorations and share it with the Gallatin community.   Examples of past travel locations and themes:     Puerto Rico: &quot;Puerto Rico and New York: Culture and Community&quot;   Cuba: &quot;The Effects of Economic Embargo&quot;   Hawaii: &quot;Colonialism and Indigeneity&quot;   New Orleans: &quot;The Social Production of Natural Disaster&quot;   Brazil: &quot;Consumerism&quot;     Americas Scholars 2014-15   Details coming soon.

It is designed to prepare students for advanced work and teaching in American studies. The Program also offers an undergraduate major and minor. American Studies at NYU is one of the country\u2019s top-ranked programs in   this dynamic field. An interdisciplinary program housed in the   Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, it studies United States   society in national, hemispheric, and global frameworks. It draws on   faculty strength in a wide range of fields, including history, area   studies, literature and film, gender studies, critical ethnic studies,   political economy, and urban and environmental studies. The program interprets \u201cAmerican\u201d in a broad sense to include   assessments of the historical role of the United States in the Americas   and, more generally, in world affairs. Inasmuch as the program has a   regional focus, special attention is given to studies in urbanism and to   New York in particular, a global city that comprises many world   cultures. Students are exposed to a range of   methodologies in the social sciences and humanities, including   ethnography, textual analysis, archival research, and cultural studies.
