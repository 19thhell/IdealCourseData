TST-CW has been developed to focus on issues related to child protection concerns. More specifically, the aim of this adaptation is to equip the social environment of a traumatized child with important information related to the legalities of child protection, entitlements, and relevant processes of the legal and court system.   Agencies that have adapted TST within the child welfare/foster care sector include Ulster County Mental Health Department (NY), Jewish Board of Family and Children\u2019s Services (NY), The Children\u2019s Village (NY), KVC Health Systems (KS, KY, NE), Allegany County Community Services (NY), Hillside Family of Agencies (NY), Lutheran Social Services of the South (TX), Cayuga Family of Services (NY), and Foster Care Counseling Project (NJ).   The TST Child Welfare approach emphasizes the importance of providing trauma informed training to child welfare case workers, as well as foster care resource parents.
