Description       This course will focus on the interplay of images and words in autobiographical texts. We will ask what it means to represent the self on the page, and how the added element of the visual \u2013 including photographs and graphic images \u2013 complicates the many negotiations involved in self-portraiture. What, if anything, do pictures convey that words cannot? How does the inclusion of images or descriptions of images affect the ways we tell, or the ways that others read, our lives? Do the formal differences between visual images that are hand-drawn, as in comics, and those that appear more \u201crealistic,\u201d like photographs, change how we approach personal narratives? Throughout the semester, students will become acquainted with the basic theories and vocabularies surrounding the intersections between the visual and the verbal. They will write four formal essay assignments that draw on the use of textual evidence, research, and the incorporation of various points of view in order to form focused and thesis-driven arguments.

Description       This course will focus on the interplay of images and words in autobiographical texts. We will ask what it means to represent the self on the page, and how the added element of the visual \u2013 including photographs and graphic images \u2013 complicates the many negotiations involved in self-portraiture. What, if anything, do pictures convey that words cannot? How does the inclusion of images or descriptions of images affect the ways we tell, or the ways that others read, our lives? Do the formal differences between visual images that are hand-drawn, as in comics, and those that appear more \u201crealistic,\u201d like photographs, change how we approach personal narratives? Throughout the semester, students will become acquainted with the basic theories and vocabularies surrounding the intersections between the visual and the verbal. They will write four formal essay assignments that draw on the use of textual evidence, research, and the incorporation of various points of view in order to form focused and thesis-driven arguments.
