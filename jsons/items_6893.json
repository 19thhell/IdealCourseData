Description       The idea of an America has been diffracted but reconstituted by a number of theorists, policymakers, (forced) laborers, and artists. Each of these actors sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny, particularly through the creation of imagined communities of identity (i.e. racial, political, religious or sexual). America proved to be an extraordinarily malleable idea. Yet, the narrative of \u201cOur America\u201d also revealed its internal contradictions and fissures within institutions and social phenomena it helped to perpetuate such as slavery, race, and empire. This course examines the cultural and political investments that have characterized the American Hemisphere. The matrix of race, class and gender has been a useful lens to analyze the systems and structures in place that both benefited and suppressed American peoples and their contributions to the construction of America. Yet, the themes of migration, exile, nationalism, sexuality, creolization, and empire-building also serve as essential tools to untangling and mapping the roots and routes of American development. Through a diverse set of materials (primary documents, secondary readings, films, music, and art) that utilize a multimedia and interdisciplinary approach to a range of anthropological, historical, literary, political and economic questions central to American experience(s), this course will critically engage the writings of thinkers (Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed Walter Mignolo, Amy Kaplan, Toni Morrison) who have helped us better understand the spheres where Francophone, Anglophone and Hispanophone worlds collide, coalesce and interpenetrate.

Michaeline Crichlow    ,     Location: Auditorium of KJCC, 53 Washington Square South, New York University, New York, NY 10012 (map)   Michaeline A Crichlow is Associate Professor of Sociology and of African and African American Studies at Duke University. She is interested in projects related to citizenship, nationalism and development mainly in the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Michaeline's current projects are focused on the sorts of claims that populations deemed diasporic make on states, and how this reconfigures their communities and general sociocultural practices. She is also interested in development's impact on social and economic environments, and the way this structures and restructures people's assessments of their spaces for the articulation and pursuit of particular kinds of freedoms. She has attempted to project these perspectives in her new book, Globalization and the Postcreole Imagination: Notes on Fleeing the Plantation (July 2009) and her current project, Power and its Subjects: Development Dilemmas, Postcolonial Restructuring of Rural Spaces/Places/Identities and State Reconfiguration.      The title for the Spring 2011 Colloquium series is \"Our America: Cross Currents and Intimate Dialogues in the Making of a Hemisphere.\" The idea of America has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. In a \u201cNew World\u201d where delineations of territory and definitions of home have shifted as populations, resources, and hegemonies respond to global and local forces, debated claims to \u201cour America\u201d (to borrow from 19th century Cuban intellectual Jose Marti) reveal \u201cAmerica\u201d to be an extraordinarily malleable notion, one that shapes and reflects understandings of belonging, identity, rights, and justice--across shifting borders and diverse conceptualizations of region and hemisphere. Emphasizing anthropological and historical approaches, this course will explore \u201cour America\u201d as simultaneously sites of empirical practice and imagined ways of being, where the interfaces, or cross currents among \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas, dialogues, and communities raise questions about the ways data inform categories of analysis as well as categories of experience.

She has attempted to project these perspectives in her new book, Globalization and the Postcreole Imagination: Notes on Fleeing the Plantation (July 2009) and her current project, Power and its Subjects: Development Dilemmas, Postcolonial Restructuring of Rural Spaces/Places/Identities and State Reconfiguration.      The title for the Spring 2011 Colloquium series is \"Our America: Cross Currents and Intimate Dialogues in the Making of a Hemisphere.\" The idea of America has long been dissected and reconstituted by a number of ideologues, theorists, policymakers, artists, activists, and ordinary people. Each has sought to craft a new existence that distinguished itself from \u201cOld World\u201d tyranny and tensions, significantly through the creation of imagined communities of identity and belonging, based on various cultural, political-economic, and social criteria. In a \u201cNew World\u201d where delineations of territory and definitions of home have shifted as populations, resources, and hegemonies respond to global and local forces, debated claims to \u201cour America\u201d (to borrow from 19th century Cuban intellectual Jose Marti) reveal \u201cAmerica\u201d to be an extraordinarily malleable notion, one that shapes and reflects understandings of belonging, identity, rights, and justice--across shifting borders and diverse conceptualizations of region and hemisphere. Emphasizing anthropological and historical approaches, this course will explore \u201cour America\u201d as simultaneously sites of empirical practice and imagined ways of being, where the interfaces, or cross currents among \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas, dialogues, and communities raise questions about the ways data inform categories of analysis as well as categories of experience.
