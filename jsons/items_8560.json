NYU is alone among the American conservation graduate programs in that we confer two degrees to our students: one in conservation and an additional degree in art history. Our students undertake laboratory work, seminars, research projects, and gain intensive experience through fieldwork and their fourth-year Internship. We enjoy ready access to the Institute's art historical resources, as well as the extraordinary collections of New York City, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art , MoMA , the Whitney Museum , the Guggenheim Museum , the American Museum of Natural History , the Brooklyn Museum of Art , and nearby galleries, private collections, auction houses, historic properties, and private conservation studios.       Our location in one of the art capitals of the world also makes it easy to draw upon the many conservators and conservation scientists in the area.             If you are thinking about applying to our program, you are most welcome to visit the Conservation Center in person; make an appointment by sending an e-mail to conservation.program@nyu.edu .       Enjoy the website and I hope to meet you in New York!
