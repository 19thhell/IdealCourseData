Over the course of an academic year, students in Capstone work in teams with faculty oversight to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question.\u00a0   Capstone projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills such as project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. For students, it's an opportunity to interweave their learning in all these areas and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment; for organizations, it's a chance to have current and future public service leaders\u00a0focused on their success.

Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum.          Congressional Research Service      Read more                         Congressional Research Service, ' 13        Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum. This experience, often referred to as a 'capstone' project, provides students a chance to work with a public or private organization in need of policy research through a formal contractual agreement. Such research partnerships between academic institutions and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) have proven extremely successful in recent years, providing public policy students with invaluable experience, exposure to working with a federal government agency and to potential employment opportunities, while at the same time generating high quality research that will benefit Congress through the work that CRS performs. Top schools with programs of particular interest have been identified based on these efforts. These include Columbia University, New York University, Princeton, Syracuse, The University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, George Washington University, Georgetown, and Carnegie-Mellon. These programs are well-established, are of sufficient length for students to accomplish substantive research and analysis on a significant project, are based on a team concept, are guided by hands-on faculty with expertise in the subject areas, and have the full support of the school administration.               The students created sets of maps for hundreds of our directly administered, affiliated and sponsored agencies and sites, and then further mapped these site locations onto various NYS boundaries.

They listened carefully to our needs, were flexible in creating the project design, and delivered a professional product. We will be incorporating the team's insights into our planning.               The transformative, thoughtful, strategic work your students are doing to implement a new and more sophisticated evaluation and monitoring system for our nonprofit is way beyond our expectations. Each member of the team is brighter and more hard-working than the next.

The students understood the idiosyncrasies of working with the various stakeholders and my office. They have provided us with an immeasurably valuable and substantive document in support of our efforts.               Our office has engaged two Capstone teams, and the final deliverables have become the subject of public acclaim, media attention, and the formation of working groups, taskforces and real dialogue on the topics they covered -- eventually resulting in real change and improvement.

Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum.          Congressional Research Service      Read more                         Congressional Research Service, ' 13        Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum. This experience, often referred to as a 'capstone' project, provides students a chance to work with a public or private organization in need of policy research through a formal contractual agreement. Such research partnerships between academic institutions and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) have proven extremely successful in recent years, providing public policy students with invaluable experience, exposure to working with a federal government agency and to potential employment opportunities, while at the same time generating high quality research that will benefit Congress through the work that CRS performs. Top schools with programs of particular interest have been identified based on these efforts. These include Columbia University, New York University, Princeton, Syracuse, The University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, George Washington University, Georgetown, and Carnegie-Mellon. These programs are well-established, are of sufficient length for students to accomplish substantive research and analysis on a significant project, are based on a team concept, are guided by hands-on faculty with expertise in the subject areas, and have the full support of the school administration.               The students created sets of maps for hundreds of our directly administered, affiliated and sponsored agencies and sites, and then further mapped these site locations onto various NYS boundaries.

The Capstone Team was phenomenal. They presented their final work to our agency's Senior Management, and we were blown away. We have been trying to do this project for years, and the students were able to facilitate the process in a few months. Kudos and thanks to the Capstone management and to the Wagner School.               The final presentation was a tour de force!

           During the fourth year, every NYUAD student will produce a Capstone Project, which may be either an individual or team project. Students do a Capstone Project in their major field. The Capstone Project is a demanding, year-long endeavor aiming at a significant piece of research or creative work\u2014an historical narrative, musical composition, performance, invention, documented experiment, scholarly thesis, or other form appropriate to the student\u2019s goals. Unlike other courses in which faculty establish the structure and set assignments, the Capstone Project puts the student in charge. The fundamental challenge is to enter unmapped terrain and to extend oneself in making knowledge, reframing conventional approaches to an issue or creating something new.     No matter what form the Capstone takes, each student will have a faculty mentor and participate in a Capstone seminar that serves as a forum to discuss the research process and present work in progress. These seminars offer a model of intellectual community and collaborative learning in which participants offer their thoughts across fields of study and engage in active critique and revision.

Over the course of an academic year, students in Capstone work in teams with faculty oversight to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question.\u00a0   Capstone projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills such as project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. For students, it's an opportunity to interweave their learning in all these areas and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment; for organizations, it's a chance to have current and future public service leaders\u00a0focused on their success.

Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum.          Congressional Research Service      Read more                         Congressional Research Service, ' 13        Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum. This experience, often referred to as a 'capstone' project, provides students a chance to work with a public or private organization in need of policy research through a formal contractual agreement. Such research partnerships between academic institutions and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) have proven extremely successful in recent years, providing public policy students with invaluable experience, exposure to working with a federal government agency and to potential employment opportunities, while at the same time generating high quality research that will benefit Congress through the work that CRS performs. Top schools with programs of particular interest have been identified based on these efforts. These include Columbia University, New York University, Princeton, Syracuse, The University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, George Washington University, Georgetown, and Carnegie-Mellon. These programs are well-established, are of sufficient length for students to accomplish substantive research and analysis on a significant project, are based on a team concept, are guided by hands-on faculty with expertise in the subject areas, and have the full support of the school administration.               The students created sets of maps for hundreds of our directly administered, affiliated and sponsored agencies and sites, and then further mapped these site locations onto various NYS boundaries.

           During the fourth year, every NYUAD student will produce a Capstone Project, which may be either an individual or team project. Students do a Capstone Project in their major field. The Capstone Project is a demanding, year-long endeavor aiming at a significant piece of research or creative work\u2014an historical narrative, musical composition, performance, invention, documented experiment, scholarly thesis, or other form appropriate to the student\u2019s goals. Unlike other courses in which faculty establish the structure and set assignments, the Capstone Project puts the student in charge. The fundamental challenge is to enter unmapped terrain and to extend oneself in making knowledge, reframing conventional approaches to an issue or creating something new.     No matter what form the Capstone takes, each student will have a faculty mentor and participate in a Capstone seminar that serves as a forum to discuss the research process and present work in progress. These seminars offer a model of intellectual community and collaborative learning in which participants offer their thoughts across fields of study and engage in active critique and revision. At the end of the school year, the students will present their Capstone work at a university-wide celebration of their creative achievements.

The project offers you the chance to work with a startup company or nonprofit organization and propose a solution to a real business need. Each year, the program partners with nonprofit organizations to design student projects that not only advance your business acumen and technological skills, but also further your commitment to social responsibility. Examples of recent student projects include:     The development and implementation of a customer service component for an online retailer   The implementation of a project management program office   The development and implementation of medical records digitization and retrieval system   The design and implementation of a management dashboard for a real estate development firm   The application of traditional business practices to small nonprofits               The Thesis Project   You may elect to work on a thesis research project in lieu of the applied project. The thesis provides an opportunity to make a unique contribution to the body of knowledge in a subject area studied in the M.S. in Management and Systems program. Working under the mentorship of a faculty supervisor, students select a topic; develop a research model; conduct research and analysis; and write a significant thesis paper to be reviewed by experts in the field.
