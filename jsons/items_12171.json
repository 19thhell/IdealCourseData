With some 50 outstanding ancient objects, and more than 100 related documents, photographs, and drawings, this groundbreaking exhibition examines the fascinating process through which archaeological objects are transformed from artifacts to artworks and, sometimes, to popular icons, as they move from the sites of their discovery, to be publicized by mass media and exhibited by museums. The exhibition focuses on excavations during the 1920s and 1930s at early Mesopotamian sites in what is modern-day Iraq, marking a golden age for archaeology. It reveals the role of archaeologists, art historians, journalists, museum curators, and conservators in constructing identities for now-iconic Mesopotamian material that not only resonated with contemporary Western popular and artistic culture, but that also placed the f inds as integral to the history of Western civilization. In a first for ISAW, From Ancie nt to Modern also features modern and contemporary art, including work by Alberto Giacometti, Willem de Kooning, Jananne al-Ani, and Michael Rakowitz, revealing the impact that Mesopotamian material had and continues to have on the art of our times.    This exhibition is organized by the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and was made possible by the generous support of the David Berg Foundation, Agnes Gund, the Tianaderrah Foundation, Hicham and Dina Aboutaam, and Fred and Diana Elghanayan, and the Leon Levy Foundation. Additional support provided by Vartan and Clare R. Gregorian and the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
