This list will be updated as more courses are reviewed and approved. Please note that course numbers and titles may change.   To search for Gallatin courses that fulfill the Foundation Requirement (liberal arts and historical and cultural requirements), go to the Gallatin Courses page . Please note that individualized projects (i.e. independent studies, tutorials, etc.) do not fulfill any area of the foundation requirement.     Most courses on the list below were offered in prior semesters and may or may not be offered in a future semester. Students should consult the Albert Course Search to see when these courses are offered.   Special Topics courses may in some cases satisfy Gallatin's historical and cultural foundation requirement, but must be considered on a case-by-case basis.To request the review of a Special Topics course, students should complete a Foundation Requirement Petition form .     To request that a new course be reviewed to fulfill one of the foundation requirements, students should complete a Foundation Requirement Petition form .

Their findings offer a new wrinkle in the history of a major economic revolution that moved civilizations away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival.   \u201cThis discovery goes beyond farming,\u201d explains Solange Rigaud, the study\u2019s lead author and a researcher at the Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) in New York City. \u201cIt also reveals two different cultural trajectories that took place in Europe thousands of years ago, with southern and central regions advancing in many ways and northern regions maintaining their traditions.\u201d   CIRHUS is a collaborative arrangement between France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and New York University.   The study, whose other authors include Francesco d\u2019Errico, a professor at CNRS and Norway\u2019s University of Bergen, and Marian Vanhaeren, a professor at CNRS, appears in the journal PLOS ONE.   In order to study these developments, the researchers focused on the adoption or rejection of ornaments\u2014certain types of beads or bracelets worn by different populations. This approach is suitable for understanding the spread of specific practices\u2014previous scholarship has shown a link between the embrace of survival methods and the adoption of particular ornaments. However, the PLOS ONE study marks the first time researchers have used ornaments to trace the adoption of farming in this part of the world during the Early Neolithic period (8,000-5,000 BCE).    It has been long established that the first farmers came to Europe 8,000 years ago, beginning in Greece and marking the start of a major economic revolution on the continent: the move from foraging to farming over the next 3,000 years. However, the pathways of the spread of farming during this period are less clear.   To explore this process, the researchers examined more than 200 bead-types found at more than 400 European sites over a 3,000-year period. Previous research has linked farming and foraging populations with the creation and adornment of discrete types of beads, bracelets, and pendants. In the PLOS ONE study, the researchers traced the adoption of ornaments linked to farming populations in order to elucidate the patterns of transition from foraging and hunting to farming.   Their results show the spread of ornaments linked to farmers\u2014human-shaped beads and bracelets composed of perforated shells\u2014stretching from eastern Greece and the Black Sea shore to France\u2019s Brittany region and from the Mediterranean Sea northward to Spain. By contrast, the researchers did not find these types of ornaments in the Baltic region of northern Europe. Rather, this area held on to decorative wear typically used by hunting and foraging populations\u2014perforated shells rather than beads or bracelets found in farming communities.   \u201cIt\u2019s clear hunters and foragers in the Baltic area resisted the adoption of ornaments worn by farmers during this period,\u201d explains Rigaud. \u201cWe\u2019ve therefore concluded that this cultural boundary reflected a block in the advancement of farming\u2014at least during the Neolithic period.\u201d   The research was supported, in part, by the French Ministry of National Education, Research, and Technology, the Fyssen Foundation, and the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie COFUND Action.

This list will be updated as more courses are reviewed and approved. Please note that course numbers and titles may change.   To search for Gallatin courses that fulfill the Foundation Requirement (liberal arts and historical and cultural requirements), go to the Gallatin Courses page . Please note that individualized projects (i.e. independent studies, tutorials, etc.) do not fulfill any area of the foundation requirement.     Most courses on the list below were offered in prior semesters and may or may not be offered in a future semester. Students should consult the Albert Course Search to see when these courses are offered.   Special Topics courses may in some cases satisfy Gallatin's historical and cultural foundation requirement, but must be considered on a case-by-case basis.To request the review of a Special Topics course, students should complete a Foundation Requirement Petition form .     To request that a new course be reviewed to fulfill one of the foundation requirements, students should complete a Foundation Requirement Petition form .

Their findings offer a new wrinkle in the history of a major economic revolution that moved civilizations away from foraging and hunting as a means for survival.   \u201cThis discovery goes beyond farming,\u201d explains Solange Rigaud, the study\u2019s lead author and a researcher at the Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences (CIRHUS) in New York City. \u201cIt also reveals two different cultural trajectories that took place in Europe thousands of years ago, with southern and central regions advancing in many ways and northern regions maintaining their traditions.\u201d   CIRHUS is a collaborative arrangement between France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and New York University.   The study, whose other authors include Francesco d\u2019Errico, a professor at CNRS and Norway\u2019s University of Bergen, and Marian Vanhaeren, a professor at CNRS, appears in the journal PLOS ONE.   In order to study these developments, the researchers focused on the adoption or rejection of ornaments\u2014certain types of beads or bracelets worn by different populations. This approach is suitable for understanding the spread of specific practices\u2014previous scholarship has shown a link between the embrace of survival methods and the adoption of particular ornaments. However, the PLOS ONE study marks the first time researchers have used ornaments to trace the adoption of farming in this part of the world during the Early Neolithic period (8,000-5,000 BCE).    It has been long established that the first farmers came to Europe 8,000 years ago, beginning in Greece and marking the start of a major economic revolution on the continent: the move from foraging to farming over the next 3,000 years. However, the pathways of the spread of farming during this period are less clear.   To explore this process, the researchers examined more than 200 bead-types found at more than 400 European sites over a 3,000-year period. Previous research has linked farming and foraging populations with the creation and adornment of discrete types of beads, bracelets, and pendants. In the PLOS ONE study, the researchers traced the adoption of ornaments linked to farming populations in order to elucidate the patterns of transition from foraging and hunting to farming.   Their results show the spread of ornaments linked to farmers\u2014human-shaped beads and bracelets composed of perforated shells\u2014stretching from eastern Greece and the Black Sea shore to France\u2019s Brittany region and from the Mediterranean Sea northward to Spain. By contrast, the researchers did not find these types of ornaments in the Baltic region of northern Europe. Rather, this area held on to decorative wear typically used by hunting and foraging populations\u2014perforated shells rather than beads or bracelets found in farming communities.   \u201cIt\u2019s clear hunters and foragers in the Baltic area resisted the adoption of ornaments worn by farmers during this period,\u201d explains Rigaud. \u201cWe\u2019ve therefore concluded that this cultural boundary reflected a block in the advancement of farming\u2014at least during the Neolithic period.\u201d   The research was supported, in part, by the French Ministry of National Education, Research, and Technology, the Fyssen Foundation, and the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie COFUND Action.
