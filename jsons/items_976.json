By offering an integrated approach to theoretical concerns in the Humanities, it responds to frequently voiced desires for a theory initiative across the disciplines. Rather than pure theorizing, the program focuses on sharing theoretical approaches and fosters interdisciplinary and international collaboration.   The program traces a historical progression from the ancient practices of poetics and rhetoric to their modern theoretical counterparts. The intimate but vexed relations between aesthetics and hermeneutics, philosophy and literature, social institutions and the work of art, form the core of study. The transdisciplinary orientation of the Certificate complements disciplinary study and sharpens students\u2019 career profiles.   The Poetics and Theory program currently comprises three elements: a Reading Group composed primarily of Poetics and Theory members but open to all graduate students and faculty; an annual schedule of events , including lectures, seminars, and conferences; and the Certificate Program itself.
