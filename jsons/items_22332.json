Through this partnership we are able to offer reduced rates for LSAT Preparatory Courses. Click here to apply!       Binary Solution is a unique system for solving the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) that is simple enough to be mastered by anyone and powerful enough to raise scores by an average of 12 points. NYU students and alumni are eligible for a reduced rate for the class. Their 130-hour course has been designed to produce LSAT scores in the 160 to 180 range. The exclusive binary method is based on a logical deconstruction of the LSAT--a process that reduces the exam to its smallest quanta of information.     Since 1991, Binary has been mapping and identifying every issue that has appeared on every LSAT. Their theoretical lens encourages students to view each LSAT question as a weighted sum of issues. Since this approach is granular, students are prepared for any juxtaposition of issues that may appear on the LSAT. At times when the LSAT shifts, Binary students are prepared for the change because both typical and boundary cases are addressed during the course of study.

Each semester we conduct a seven week course on site at prison classrooms and libraries.   PREP instruction largely mirrors what students learn in Lawyering, making it the perfect activity for a 1L. It gives students a chance to get involved in something very important without overloading an already busy schedule. Every member of PREP is expected to co-teach a lesson at a women's prison in the downstate area. PREP participants teach in pairs: for one facility they will travel to the prison in the morning via commuter rail and return by late afternoon; the other is just a short subway trip away. Past teachers can attest to the fact that the experience is challenging, interesting, and rewarding.   At a minimum, inmates deserve the right to understand the system under which they are incarcerated. Take the opportunity to share your knowledge.
