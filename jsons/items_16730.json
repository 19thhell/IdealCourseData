Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.   Explores the history of  history writing in the United States, examining national histories  written in the 19th and 20th centuries as part of American  intellectual history. Focuses on theme, interpretation, points of  view, and style in the work of past historians.    Liberalism and Conservatism since the New Deal HIST-UA 418 Offered every year. 4 points. This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.      Seminar: Constructions  of Race in U.S. History   HIST-UA 680 Hodes. 4  points.   Explores the ideas of  race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across  regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language,  color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.      Seminar: Race, Civil  War, Reconstruction   HIST-UA 683 Hodes. 4  points.   The American Civil War  punctuated the 19th century and transformed the nation. This seminar  explores the experiences of slaves and former slaves, politicians and  community leaders, civilians and families, soldiers and veterans, and  proceeds from the premise that slavery and race were central to the  war\u2019s causes and consequences.      Seminar: Ideology and  Social Change in American History   HIST-UA 684 Offered  every other year. 4 points.   Explores classical  arguments in American history concerning social behavior. Central  themes: the power of cultural conditioning, the role of schooling and  other acculturating institutions, the uses of \u201cuplifting\u201d reform  and organizational benevolence, and the intervention of professional  experts into social policymaking. Special attention to the role of  ethnic and racial leaders, proponents of success and socialization,  critical investigations of family and femininity, and analysis of  distinctive generational responses to these and related issues.      Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.   Explores the historical  issues of the Great Depression and the New Deal years, 1933\u20131941,  by discussing several relevant works on this period. Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.

Examines 20th-century  Taiwan and China in their interrelationship and their divergent  paths. It is not a diplomatic or international history course.  Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.

The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts.

Europe in the early  Middle Ages was created out of a mixture of ingredients: the legacy  of the Roman Empire; the growth and development of Christianity;  invading peoples who settled within the boundaries of the former  Roman Empire; and the clash of competing languages, religions, and  legal systems. This tumultuous time forged a new entity, medieval  Europe, whose development, growing pains, and creative successes this  course examines. Uses the records and artifacts of the period itself  as central elements for investigating the period.      The Crusades   HIST-UA 113 Identical  to MEDI-UA 113. Offered every other year. 4 points.

We investigate Mao\u2019s thought and  theories, as well as his revolutionary practice, not as biographical  artifacts but as products of and contributors to the revolutionary  situation in China and the world in the 20th century. We end with  Mao\u2019s afterlives. The majority of the readings are drawn from Mao\u2019s  own writings. Students will learn to read Mao\u2019s texts intensively  and extensively.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour.

Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history.

The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.

Takes up a watershed  event in Japanese history, the greatest single preoccupation of  Japanese historians. The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Global and Special  Topics Seminars    History of the Body HIST-UA 310 Offered every two years. 4 points. History of the Body from Birth to Death. Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture. Readings will range from the seventeenth to the twentieth century and will focus primarily, but not exclusively on Europe and the United States. Topics will include the study of the production and consumption of particular commodities; middle-class and working-class consumer cultures in the nineteenth century; and mass production and mass consumption in the twentieth century. We will look at protests and popular movements organized around issues of consumption; examine how products from the non-European world transformed European and American consumption; and how European, and especially American patterns of consumption shaped consumption elsewhere.

Research Fields: A frica, African Diaspora, Urban  History, Historical Cartography, Digital Humanities.           \u201cLagoon City: Lagos in the Nineteenth Century Bight of  Benin\u201d is a spatial history of Lagos between 1845 and 1868, one that takes into  account Lagos\u2019 role as the economic, political and cultural focal point of the  region. My research is rooted in urban history, but offers an interdisciplinary  response to analyzing the ways that coastal West Africans imagined, manipulated  and represented their cities. By analyzing myths of origin, songs, missionary  journals, newspapers, naval dispatches and reports, in tandem with the colonial  maps, sketches and surveys that fix and plot their ideas and activities, I  create maps paired with textual narratives to reconstruct their past in place.

Covering the period from the arrival of the SS Windrush from Jamaica in  1948 to Member of Parliament Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech  in 1968, this project situates the development of networks of communication and  Caribbean radical politics both in the metropole and abroad. I utilize the  writings of influential artists and intellectuals, the activities of West  Indian student groups, correspondence between migrants and allies in the  Caribbean, social science research, and literary culture to illustrate the ways  migrants reckoned with racialization in the capital and ushered in a generation  of political mobilization which worked for the civil rights of people of color  in Britain. Ultimately, the hostile environment in London shocked the  migrants out of their colonial island identities, and their collective trauma  then contributed to the making of a new post-colonial, metropolitan  identity. This process was borne out of migrants\u2019 racialized experiences  in London and their maintenance of networks of communication and association  with family and friends in the West Indies.

My dissertation is entitled \u2018\u201cSo That Tomorrow Would Be Better for  Us:\u2019 Developing French-Funded Catholic Schools in Dahomey and Senegal,  1946-1975.\u201d I analyze the rapid expansion of Catholic schools in a largely  Muslim and multi-religious West Africa from the post-World War II to the  postcolonial period. I draw on never before used sources from over twenty  official and unofficial archives in Benin, Senegal, Italy, and France, as well  as interviews conducted with over 60 former students. The moral, civic vision  of those affiliated with these schools influenced a key generation of schoolchildren,  many of whom carried this into their professional lives as public servants and  citizens of newly independent West African nations.

L  M   Jeppe Mulich      Jeppe  Mulich holds an MA in European Studies from Yale University and a BSc in  Political Science from the University of Copenhagen. His work lies in the  disciplinary intersection between history, sociology, and international  relations and focuses on theories of empire in global history, in particular  the constitutive qualities of imperial practices; trans-imperial networks and  regional integration; hierarchy and international orders; and globalization as  a historical phenomenon. At New York University he works with Lauren Benton and  his dissertation, examining inter-imperial relations in the colonial Caribbean,  is entitled \u201cIn a Sea of Empires: Networks and Crossings in the Leeward  Islands, 1783-1834.\u201d           Jeppe  has published in The Journal of Global History, co-authored a piece in a  forthcoming anthology on spatial history, and presented ongoing research at a  number of conferences, including the International Studies Association, the  Society of Early Americanists, and the Millennium Conference at the LSE. Before  embarking upon his doctoral studies, he worked on political affairs at the  Permanent Mission of Denmark to the United Nations in New York.  N  O              Mairin Odle      I am a  Ph.D. candidate in Atlantic history, with particular interests in  cross-cultural encounters, race, gender, and histories of the body in early  America.           My  dissertation, \u201cStories Written on the Body: Cross-Cultural Markings in the  North American Atlantic, 1600-1830\u201d, examines the role of permanent body  modifications in early American conceptions of cultural difference and personal  identity. In my research, I investigate  how cross-cultural contact between Native American, European, and African  societies in 17th- and 18th-century North America could alter individuals\u2019  physical appearances in profound ways\u2014focusing on three types of marks:  scalping, tattooing, and branding. These marks were connected by their  painful origins, the physical intimacy their infliction demanded, and their  symbolic, storytelling power. Tracing the experiences of marked  individuals, as well as the stories told about them, I demonstrate how  contested ideas about the nature of human and societal difference\u2014which played  out in diplomacy as well as violent conflict, captivity, and  enslavement\u2014actually reshaped early American bodies. Those reshaped  bodies in turn, I argue, were key to establishing (or disrupting) the material  reality of such ideas, particularly those emerging in the eighteenth century  about permanent and racialized physical identity.            Currently a Mellon Dissertation  Fellow in History here at NYU, I have held fellowships at the McNeil Center for  Early American Studies, the Newberry Library, the John Carter Brown Library,  the American Antiquarian Society, and the Library Company of Philadelphia and  Historical Society of Pennsylvania. My  work has appeared in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography , as  well as The Appendix and The Atlantic .               Alison K. Okuda      Alison  K. Okuda entered the doctoral program in African Diaspora History in 2009 and,  along the way, she was awarded a M.Phil. in History. Under the guidance of  Michael Gomez, she is currently writing her dissertation, entitled \u201cCaribbean  and African Exchanges: The Post-Colonial Transformation of Ghanaian Music,  Identity, and Social Structure.\u201d It questions the meaning of pan-Africanism for  individuals in Ghana and the Caribbean through a look at inter-community  relations in the music scenes of London and Accra during the mid-twentieth  century. Focusing on how these people experienced a variety of music and  cultures demonstrates that popular conceptions of pan-Africanism in Ghana were  expansive and included the African diaspora. Such an inclusive attitude subsequently  influenced Ghanaian policies and institutions during the process of nation  building. In addition to her research fields in African Diaspora, West African,  and cultural history, Alison has research and teaching interests in Caribbean,  African American, and migration studies.           Ms.  Okuda has been an active member of the history department through such  activities as the African/Diaspora Student Workshop, which she co-created, the  Graduate History Teaching Collaborative, which she also co-created and has  continued to serve on its organizing committee, and the Africa-Diaspora Forum,  a faculty-led program for which she is the current assistant. Recently, she has  taught such courses as \u201cAfrica: History and Culture\u201d at Concordia  University-Wisconsin and \u201cNarratives of Cultural Exchange in African Diaspora  History\u201d at NYU, as well as led discussions as a Teaching Assistant for  \u201cCultures and Contexts: Global Asia.\u201d Her commitment to teaching is further  supported by her publications in the history department-funded Graduate  Teaching Handbook and the journal Metropolitan  Archivist under the title, \u201cDual Uses of the Archives: Critical Moments in  Researching and Teaching\u201d (Summer 2013). Alison has also presented her work in  range of spaces, from the African/Diaspora Student Workshop to international  conferences convened by the Ghana Studies Association, the Association of  Caribbean Historians, and the Association for the Study of the Worldwide  African Diaspora.   P  Q  R            Gabriel de Avilez Rocha           Advisor:  Lauren Benton           I am a  PhD Candidate specializing in the legal and environmental history of the early  modern Iberian Atlantic. My interests include comparative colonial Americas,  slavery and capitalism, ethnohistory, and empires in world history. Other interests  involve political ecology, actor-network theory, and global intellectual  history.           My  dissertation, titled \u201cEmpires Made Flesh: Commons in the Macaronesian Atlantic,  1450-1600\u201d investigates the intersections between communal resource  arrangements and Iberian imperial escalation in the early modern Atlantic  world. It focuses on the Macaronesian archipelagos (the Azores, Madeira, the  Canaries, and Cape Verde) as crossroads between Iberia, Northern Europe, the  African Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Americas. I study instances of  conflict and cooperation over extractive industries related to lumber,  minerals, plants, water, fish, and animals, alongside contemporaneous  initiatives of slaving, plunder, and colonization. Through local and regional  developments, I seek to understand how individuals and collectives from diverse  social and ethnic backgrounds sought profit and sustenance in the early modern  Atlantic.

Federico Sor      Areas of teaching interests: modern Latin America and the Caribbean, colonial Latin America, modern global history  Research interests: Latin America, political history, social history, Cold War, national narratives  Courses taught: \"A History of Capitalism,\" \"Contemporary World: An Introduction to Global History Since 1800\"  Dissertation: \"The Pedagogy of Revolution and Counterrevolution in Argentina, 1966-1983\" My   dissertation is a study of competing political ideologies and projects   in Cold War Argentina, focusing on education as a site where those   ideologies and projects are expressed with particular clarity.   Concentrating on civic education curricula, pedagogic techniques, and   literacy campaigns, my work explores how different regimes aimed at   forming citizens for specific conceptions of society and polity. The   narrative is based on a combination of archival research and personal   accounts accessed through oral histories from over seventy interviews   conducted with former students, teachers, professors, inspectors,   literacy educators, political activists, and government   officials--including the two most important ministers of education of   the 1976-1983 dictatorship. In this way, my dissertation assesses how a   number of people, with varying degrees of political commitment ranging   from armed training to relative apathy, lived through turbulent times,   responded to various political projects, and worked to influence   political outcomes.

Her dissertation, \u201cA  Trade of Their Own: Market Women, Insurgent Economies, and the Making of Caribbean  Freedom, 1800-1888,\u201d examines the economic practices of enslaved and free black  women in the context of the nineteenth century transition from slavery to  freedom. This work traces the development of the economies of the enslaved from  the marketing of surplus produce from individual and family provision grounds  to the feeding of entire colonies and the formation of plebian transimperial  trading networks in the Caribbean basin. \u2018A Trade of Their Own\u2019 argues that though  this informal economy subsidized slave society by reducing the costs of social  reproduction, the female-centered markets of Atlantic world were also multi-faceted  institutions that fostered an ethos of black autonomy conducive to rebellion and  antagonistic to the worst aspects of slavery\u2019s exploitation .          Shauna has taught history courses on Africa, global Asia,  Latin America and the Caribbean, and the black Atlantic.

We end with  Mao\u2019s afterlives. The majority of the readings are drawn from Mao\u2019s  own writings. Students will learn to read Mao\u2019s texts intensively  and extensively. This is a reading- and writing-intensive course.      Topics in Chinese  History   HIST-UA 551 Identical  to EAST-UA 551. Offered every year. Karl, Waley-Cohen, M. Young. 4  points.

By bridging the conventional divide  between \u201ccolonial\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d Africa, the course opens  up questions about the changes in African economies, religious  beliefs, family relations, and conceptions of the world around them  during the last half century. Students read political and literary  writings by African intellectuals, as well as the work of scholars  based inside and outside Africa, and view and discuss videos.

Its struggle for independence from Spain helped usher in an  age of U.S. imperialism. It is the hemisphere\u2019s first and last  socialist state. This brief description hints not only at the  complexities of Cuban history but also at its significance for  international histories of nationalism and imperialism, race and  slavery, the Cold War and socialist revolution.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union. This course traces the evolution of European capitalism   during the twentieth century, from a laissez-faire to a social market   economy. Throughout the semester we will study key themes and turning   points that shaped Europe's economic development: the Great Depression;   the World Wars; alternative ways of organizing an economic life under   fascism and communism; the stagnation of the 1970s; and European   economic integration.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.

Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.

It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history.

Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.

Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.

Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts.

Research Fields: A frica, African Diaspora, Urban  History, Historical Cartography, Digital Humanities.           \u201cLagoon City: Lagos in the Nineteenth Century Bight of  Benin\u201d is a spatial history of Lagos between 1845 and 1868, one that takes into  account Lagos\u2019 role as the economic, political and cultural focal point of the  region. My research is rooted in urban history, but offers an interdisciplinary  response to analyzing the ways that coastal West Africans imagined, manipulated  and represented their cities. By analyzing myths of origin, songs, missionary  journals, newspapers, naval dispatches and reports, in tandem with the colonial  maps, sketches and surveys that fix and plot their ideas and activities, I  create maps paired with textual narratives to reconstruct their past in place.

Covering the period from the arrival of the SS Windrush from Jamaica in  1948 to Member of Parliament Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech  in 1968, this project situates the development of networks of communication and  Caribbean radical politics both in the metropole and abroad. I utilize the  writings of influential artists and intellectuals, the activities of West  Indian student groups, correspondence between migrants and allies in the  Caribbean, social science research, and literary culture to illustrate the ways  migrants reckoned with racialization in the capital and ushered in a generation  of political mobilization which worked for the civil rights of people of color  in Britain. Ultimately, the hostile environment in London shocked the  migrants out of their colonial island identities, and their collective trauma  then contributed to the making of a new post-colonial, metropolitan  identity. This process was borne out of migrants\u2019 racialized experiences  in London and their maintenance of networks of communication and association  with family and friends in the West Indies.

My dissertation is entitled \u2018\u201cSo That Tomorrow Would Be Better for  Us:\u2019 Developing French-Funded Catholic Schools in Dahomey and Senegal,  1946-1975.\u201d I analyze the rapid expansion of Catholic schools in a largely  Muslim and multi-religious West Africa from the post-World War II to the  postcolonial period. I draw on never before used sources from over twenty  official and unofficial archives in Benin, Senegal, Italy, and France, as well  as interviews conducted with over 60 former students. The moral, civic vision  of those affiliated with these schools influenced a key generation of schoolchildren,  many of whom carried this into their professional lives as public servants and  citizens of newly independent West African nations.

N  O              Mairin Odle      I am a  Ph.D. candidate in Atlantic history, with particular interests in  cross-cultural encounters, race, gender, and histories of the body in early  America.           My  dissertation, \u201cStories Written on the Body: Cross-Cultural Markings in the  North American Atlantic, 1600-1830\u201d, examines the role of permanent body  modifications in early American conceptions of cultural difference and personal  identity. In my research, I investigate  how cross-cultural contact between Native American, European, and African  societies in 17th- and 18th-century North America could alter individuals\u2019  physical appearances in profound ways\u2014focusing on three types of marks:  scalping, tattooing, and branding. These marks were connected by their  painful origins, the physical intimacy their infliction demanded, and their  symbolic, storytelling power. Tracing the experiences of marked  individuals, as well as the stories told about them, I demonstrate how  contested ideas about the nature of human and societal difference\u2014which played  out in diplomacy as well as violent conflict, captivity, and  enslavement\u2014actually reshaped early American bodies. Those reshaped  bodies in turn, I argue, were key to establishing (or disrupting) the material  reality of such ideas, particularly those emerging in the eighteenth century  about permanent and racialized physical identity.            Currently a Mellon Dissertation  Fellow in History here at NYU, I have held fellowships at the McNeil Center for  Early American Studies, the Newberry Library, the John Carter Brown Library,  the American Antiquarian Society, and the Library Company of Philadelphia and  Historical Society of Pennsylvania. My  work has appeared in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography , as  well as The Appendix and The Atlantic .               Alison K. Okuda      Alison  K. Okuda entered the doctoral program in African Diaspora History in 2009 and,  along the way, she was awarded a M.Phil. in History. Under the guidance of  Michael Gomez, she is currently writing her dissertation, entitled \u201cCaribbean  and African Exchanges: The Post-Colonial Transformation of Ghanaian Music,  Identity, and Social Structure.\u201d It questions the meaning of pan-Africanism for  individuals in Ghana and the Caribbean through a look at inter-community  relations in the music scenes of London and Accra during the mid-twentieth  century. Focusing on how these people experienced a variety of music and  cultures demonstrates that popular conceptions of pan-Africanism in Ghana were  expansive and included the African diaspora. Such an inclusive attitude subsequently  influenced Ghanaian policies and institutions during the process of nation  building. In addition to her research fields in African Diaspora, West African,  and cultural history, Alison has research and teaching interests in Caribbean,  African American, and migration studies.           Ms.  Okuda has been an active member of the history department through such  activities as the African/Diaspora Student Workshop, which she co-created, the  Graduate History Teaching Collaborative, which she also co-created and has  continued to serve on its organizing committee, and the Africa-Diaspora Forum,  a faculty-led program for which she is the current assistant. Recently, she has  taught such courses as \u201cAfrica: History and Culture\u201d at Concordia  University-Wisconsin and \u201cNarratives of Cultural Exchange in African Diaspora  History\u201d at NYU, as well as led discussions as a Teaching Assistant for  \u201cCultures and Contexts: Global Asia.\u201d Her commitment to teaching is further  supported by her publications in the history department-funded Graduate  Teaching Handbook and the journal Metropolitan  Archivist under the title, \u201cDual Uses of the Archives: Critical Moments in  Researching and Teaching\u201d (Summer 2013). Alison has also presented her work in  range of spaces, from the African/Diaspora Student Workshop to international  conferences convened by the Ghana Studies Association, the Association of  Caribbean Historians, and the Association for the Study of the Worldwide  African Diaspora.   P  Q  R            Gabriel de Avilez Rocha           Advisor:  Lauren Benton           I am a  PhD Candidate specializing in the legal and environmental history of the early  modern Iberian Atlantic. My interests include comparative colonial Americas,  slavery and capitalism, ethnohistory, and empires in world history. Other interests  involve political ecology, actor-network theory, and global intellectual  history.           My  dissertation, titled \u201cEmpires Made Flesh: Commons in the Macaronesian Atlantic,  1450-1600\u201d investigates the intersections between communal resource  arrangements and Iberian imperial escalation in the early modern Atlantic  world. It focuses on the Macaronesian archipelagos (the Azores, Madeira, the  Canaries, and Cape Verde) as crossroads between Iberia, Northern Europe, the  African Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Americas. I study instances of  conflict and cooperation over extractive industries related to lumber,  minerals, plants, water, fish, and animals, alongside contemporaneous  initiatives of slaving, plunder, and colonization. Through local and regional  developments, I seek to understand how individuals and collectives from diverse  social and ethnic backgrounds sought profit and sustenance in the early modern  Atlantic.

Concentrating on civic education curricula, pedagogic techniques, and   literacy campaigns, my work explores how different regimes aimed at   forming citizens for specific conceptions of society and polity. The   narrative is based on a combination of archival research and personal   accounts accessed through oral histories from over seventy interviews   conducted with former students, teachers, professors, inspectors,   literacy educators, political activists, and government   officials--including the two most important ministers of education of   the 1976-1983 dictatorship. In this way, my dissertation assesses how a   number of people, with varying degrees of political commitment ranging   from armed training to relative apathy, lived through turbulent times,   responded to various political projects, and worked to influence   political outcomes.

Her dissertation, \u201cA  Trade of Their Own: Market Women, Insurgent Economies, and the Making of Caribbean  Freedom, 1800-1888,\u201d examines the economic practices of enslaved and free black  women in the context of the nineteenth century transition from slavery to  freedom. This work traces the development of the economies of the enslaved from  the marketing of surplus produce from individual and family provision grounds  to the feeding of entire colonies and the formation of plebian transimperial  trading networks in the Caribbean basin. \u2018A Trade of Their Own\u2019 argues that though  this informal economy subsidized slave society by reducing the costs of social  reproduction, the female-centered markets of Atlantic world were also multi-faceted  institutions that fostered an ethos of black autonomy conducive to rebellion and  antagonistic to the worst aspects of slavery\u2019s exploitation .          Shauna has taught history courses on Africa, global Asia,  Latin America and the Caribbean, and the black Atlantic.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

VISAR-AD 113 Photography as Art and Practice                                                                              Students learn the history, criticism, and variety of theoretical approaches to photography while developing their own skills in the photographic media. The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

VISAR-AD 126 Interventions: Three-Dimensional Thinking                                                        In this seminar we will study the new NYU Campus in Abu Dhabi and use the campus grounds as a site to develop temporary sculptural interventions in this public or semipublic space. We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualisations of sculpture since the 1960s that have understood the physical location of the work of art as a integral to our perception of it. The evolution of context-related sculpture since the 1960s led in the 1980s and 1990s to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will discuss the differences between them in class and ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. This includes questioning what sort of public a sculptural intervention should take into account and how this public differs from the audience at an art gallery. What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? Over the course of the seminar, we will work out the basic conditions within which we will be allowed to make sculptural interventions on campus. The selected sites will be analyzed in detail. The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.

Students explore multiple aspects of visual design from aesthetics to user interfaces and usability, with special consideration of signage in Abu Dhabi. They also develop graphic designs that respond to the Abu Dhabi environment. Practical exercises that emphasize visual communication skills are central to the class. Students become familiar with the design procedures at the core of successful visual identity systems, thus developing their skills in research methodologies, data gathering, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and creative solutions, team work and monitoring.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.
