The distributed nature of such processes creates challenges in control. I will present my recent results on the nonlinear control of delay systems with nonconstant delays and on the nonlinear control of coupled PDE systems, using the concepts of nonlinear predictor feedback and infinite-dimensional backstepping transformation. I will introduce a methodology for the control of gas emissions in IC engines using a PDE-based approach. I will explain how the control and analysis tools, that I have developed, can be applied to four major technological problems--control over networks, 3-D printing, oil drilling, and cooling systems. I will conclude by addressing some additional potential future research areas.   About the Speaker   Nikolaos Bekiaris-Liberis is a PhD candidate at UC, San Diego, graduating in Spring 2013. He has coauthored 12 journal papers and the upcoming SIAM book &quot;Nonlinear Control under Nonconstant Delays.&quot; Bekiaris-Liberis taught tutorials on control of nonlinear delay systems at the 2012 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control and within the European Embedded Control Institute in 2013. He was guest editor for a special issue in the International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing. Bekiaris-Liberis was finalist for the student best paper award at the 2010 ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference. His interests are in distributed parameter systems, nonlinear control, and applications in automotive engines and catalysts, additive manufacturing and manufacturing processes, oil drilling and production, networks, traffic systems, robotics, and energy systems.
