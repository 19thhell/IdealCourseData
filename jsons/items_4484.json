A-E | F-K | L-Q | R-Z                     Akhtar, Asif   Asif Akhtar holds an MA in Politics from the New School for Social Research and a BA in International Studies and Economics from Ohio Wesleyan University. Having grown up in Lahore, Pakistan, Asif&rsquo;s research interests have come to converge on questions of how recently emerging industries and formats of 24-hour televised news in Pakistan are rapidly collapsing and reshaping spatial-temporal patterns &ndash; affecting the ways in which everyday practices and discourses of politics take place in the context of war and insurgency. Asif is keen on exploring dynamics of visibility, visual culture and representations of violence through ethnographic work, focusing particularly on how circuits of mediated cultural flows feed-back into political events &ndash; such as suicide blasts and terrorist attacks &ndash; influencing collective memory through nationwide broadcasts. After working on Wall St. and witnessing the mortgage crisis firsthand as a risk analyst from 2006-2008, Asif moved back to conduct research in Pakistan while gaining experience working as a journalist. Covering politics, culture and terrorism in Lahore, he has written for publications like the Guardian and Foreign Policy in addition to several prominent Pakistani print and online publications. Presently he is an active part of the Naked Punch editorial collective, publishing engaged reviews of art, thought and politics from the Third World. Asif also writes fiction and has published short stories and monographs.

Prior to arriving at MCC, Jamie was an undergraduate at The American University in Paris and earned her MA in Cinema Studies from Tisch. She has also completed The Graduate Program in Media and Culture through NYU's Department of Anthropology.

Feldman, Jessica   Jessica&rsquo;s academic and artistic work focuses on the relationships among emerging digital and virtual technologies, sound, creative labor and process, and problems of control, surveillance, communication, censorship, and violence. She is interested particularly in workers&rsquo; rights, value(s), and economics with relation to contemporary creative production and the dissolution of the artistic object in the post-digital age.

Ferreira, Rodrigo   Rodrigo is a doctoral student in the Department of Media, Culture and Communication at New York University.

Heuson, Jennifer   Jen Heuson is a scholar, traveler, and media artist currently pursuing her PhD in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at NYU. Her work critically engages the mediated production, consumption, and circulation of knowledge, culture, memory, sentiment, and identity during travel, both real and imagined. Specifically, she is interested in exploring links between experience, sensation, sentiment, and liveness or everydayness, on one hand, and mediated histories, epistemologies, and politics, on the other. Jen's work engages these questions through traditional academic forms (conference, journal, thesis) and through various multimedia inquiries (sound ethnography, film documentary, tourist performance). Her award-winning films have screened internationally at venues as diverse as FLEX Fest, Big Muddy, Black Maria, and the Margaret Mead Film &amp; Video Festival. Her dissertation investigates tourist soundscapes in the Black Hills of South Dakota, exploring the acoustic aspects of historical, cultural, and national pedagogy and performance. Jen holds an MA in Film and Television Studies and an MA in Philosophy and Cultural Analysis, both from the University of Amsterdam. For more about Jen and her collaborative work with partner Kevin T. Allen, visit smallgauge.org .

Kneese, Tamara   Tamara&rsquo;s work examines what happens to your digital assets after you die and why this matters. Digital estate planning websites allow social networking site users to concretize and control otherwise ephemeral forms of personhood, passing image management rights on to kin members. Unpaid labor on the part of Facebook users, for example, produces a profit for the company, but also does something for the users great enough to make countless hours of free labor worth it, to the point where individuals wish to archive and preserve their digital remains even after they die. How are we to define value in a post-Fordist economy, and what do affective investments on the part of immaterial laborers produce? Before completing her MA in social sciences at the University of Chicago and moving to Brooklyn, Tamara earned a BA in anthropology from a cornfield in Ohio (aka Kenyon College). Tamara&rsquo;s broader interests include affective labor, networks, digital archives, technology and the occult, social media, and vintage clothes.           Koslov, Elizabeth   Liz Koslov is a PhD candidate in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University. Her dissertation explores what mediates people&rsquo;s understandings of climate change and their ability to adapt to its effects. More specifically, it is an ethnography of &ldquo;managed retreat&rdquo; on Staten Island after Hurricane Sandy that analyzes the social and political dynamics of urban coastal retreat, and the role of media such as flood maps and local news in collective climate change adaptation. Liz has spoken about this research in the New Yorker and on WNYC&rsquo;s Brian Lehrer Show . At NYU, she is also a research assistant at the Institute for Public Knowledge and a member of the Superstorm Research Lab . Before beginning her PhD, Liz received an MSc in Culture and Society from the Department of Sociology at the London School of Economics and a BA in Communication and Spanish and Latin American Literature from the George Washington University. koslov@nyu.edu / lizkoslov.com / @LizKoslov .          Kulkarni, Kavita   Kavita holds a BA in Sociology from Emory University and an MA in Interdisciplinary Studies from NYU under the advisement of Stephen Duncombe. Her MA thesis considered the role of spectacular culture within grassroots progressive movements in the US through ethnographic work with graphic designers, communicators, and messaging professionals operating within economic and social justice campaigns. Prior to pursuing her doctoral degree, Kavita worked as a community organizer on various economic justice issues in Atlanta and spent four years as a digital media strategist and planner for IBM through the ad firm Neo@Ogilvy. Her current work as a PhD candidate broadly considers how cultural activity in urban public spaces is regulated as neighborhoods are revalorized and gentrified, and looks specifically at an open-air dance music festival that has taken place in central Brooklyn&rsquo;s Fort Greene Park for the past 12 years.

She received her S.M.

Lockett, Will   Will works on digital games, but only sort of. His current project is to understand the relation between game design practice (generously conceived), skill acquisition processes, and the politics of skill in the context of post-industrial capitalism. He approaches these issues through a set of objects skirting the boundaries of what counts as a digital game&mdash;such as music and image production apps for mobile devices, one-off responsive environments built in research-creation labs, and indie games that renew and reinvent the tradition of 3D simulation handed down to us since the Quake engine. The philosophies and histories that work to comprise these objects include phenomenology and process philosophy, theories of post-industrial capitalism, art&rsquo;s histories of perception, the history of cognitive science and systems theory, and a hodgepodge of methods useful for the fine-grained description of technical objects. While completing his MA in Art History through McGill&rsquo;s department of Art History and Communication Studies, Will worked on Husserlian phenomenology of time consciousness, Conterstrike 1.6 , and The Night Journey under the supervision of Christine Ross.
