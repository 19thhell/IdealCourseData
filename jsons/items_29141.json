Def Jam Recordings was started by young entrepreneurs Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin in the early 1980s, out of Rubin's Weinstein Hall dorm room. 25 years later, the once-independent label has launched the careers of some of music's greatest superstars (L.L. Cool J, Run D.M.C., Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Rihanna, Ashanti, and Kanye West, etc) and changed the face of global youth culture. ABOUT THE BOOK Celebrating the company's 25th Anniversary, the just-released book Def Jam Recordings (Rizzoli New York) is a stunning oral history of Def Jam in the words of its artists and top executives, taken from interviews and seamlessly told as a narrative of no-holds barred recollections and anecdotes. ABOUT THE EVENT On Monday, October 17, 2011: During this rare conversation event, authors Bill Adler, Cey Adams and Dan Charnas presented a video/slide lecture and had Q&amp;A about their new book. The discussion was moderated by Tisch Photography and Imaging Chair, Deborah Willis and Recorded Music Artistic Director, Jason King.
