Bio:   My main research and teaching field is the socioeconomic, cultural and political history of the modern Middle East, particularly the Mashriq. Under the influence of the \"new social history\" and \"history from below\" movements of the 1960s and 1970s, I did my doctoral dissertation on the emergence and evolution of a working class and labor movement in Egypt from the late nineteenth century until the Second World War; it was published in 1987 in a book co-authored with Joel Beinin. Since then I have sporadically continued to work on Egypt, with a special interest in society, culture and politics in the 1882-1919 period. I have also done a great deal of research on Palestine, manifested (among other things) in a 1989 edited volume on the Intifada and a 1996 book on relations between Arab and Jewish workers and labor movements in Palestine during the British mandate period, and various articles and papers. My most recent book is an introduction to the history and politics of Orientalism and Middle East studies, with particular attention to the study of the Middle East in the United States since 1945 and its intersections with U.S. policy in that region. Along the way I have served as president of the Middle East Studies Association and as a member of the Joint Committee on the Near and Middle East of the Social Science Research Council/American Council of Learned Societies, and as an editor (and currently a contributing editor) of Middle East Report.

Under the influence of the \"new social history\" and \"history from below\" movements of the 1960s and 1970s, I did my doctoral dissertation on the emergence and evolution of a working class and labor movement in Egypt from the late nineteenth century until the Second World War; it was published in 1987 in a book co-authored with Joel Beinin. Since then I have sporadically continued to work on Egypt, with a special interest in society, culture and politics in the 1882-1919 period. I have also done a great deal of research on Palestine, manifested (among other things) in a 1989 edited volume on the Intifada and a 1996 book on relations between Arab and Jewish workers and labor movements in Palestine during the British mandate period, and various articles and papers. My most recent book is an introduction to the history and politics of Orientalism and Middle East studies, with particular attention to the study of the Middle East in the United States since 1945 and its intersections with U.S. policy in that region. Along the way I have served as president of the Middle East Studies Association and as a member of the Joint Committee on the Near and Middle East of the Social Science Research Council/American Council of Learned Societies, and as an editor (and currently a contributing editor) of Middle East Report.

Research Fields: A frica, African Diaspora, Urban  History, Historical Cartography, Digital Humanities.           \u201cLagoon City: Lagos in the Nineteenth Century Bight of  Benin\u201d is a spatial history of Lagos between 1845 and 1868, one that takes into  account Lagos\u2019 role as the economic, political and cultural focal point of the  region. My research is rooted in urban history, but offers an interdisciplinary  response to analyzing the ways that coastal West Africans imagined, manipulated  and represented their cities. By analyzing myths of origin, songs, missionary  journals, newspapers, naval dispatches and reports, in tandem with the colonial  maps, sketches and surveys that fix and plot their ideas and activities, I  create maps paired with textual narratives to reconstruct their past in place.

Covering the period from the arrival of the SS Windrush from Jamaica in  1948 to Member of Parliament Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech  in 1968, this project situates the development of networks of communication and  Caribbean radical politics both in the metropole and abroad. I utilize the  writings of influential artists and intellectuals, the activities of West  Indian student groups, correspondence between migrants and allies in the  Caribbean, social science research, and literary culture to illustrate the ways  migrants reckoned with racialization in the capital and ushered in a generation  of political mobilization which worked for the civil rights of people of color  in Britain. Ultimately, the hostile environment in London shocked the  migrants out of their colonial island identities, and their collective trauma  then contributed to the making of a new post-colonial, metropolitan  identity. This process was borne out of migrants\u2019 racialized experiences  in London and their maintenance of networks of communication and association  with family and friends in the West Indies.

My dissertation is entitled \u2018\u201cSo That Tomorrow Would Be Better for  Us:\u2019 Developing French-Funded Catholic Schools in Dahomey and Senegal,  1946-1975.\u201d I analyze the rapid expansion of Catholic schools in a largely  Muslim and multi-religious West Africa from the post-World War II to the  postcolonial period. I draw on never before used sources from over twenty  official and unofficial archives in Benin, Senegal, Italy, and France, as well  as interviews conducted with over 60 former students. The moral, civic vision  of those affiliated with these schools influenced a key generation of schoolchildren,  many of whom carried this into their professional lives as public servants and  citizens of newly independent West African nations.

L  M   Jeppe Mulich      Jeppe  Mulich holds an MA in European Studies from Yale University and a BSc in  Political Science from the University of Copenhagen. His work lies in the  disciplinary intersection between history, sociology, and international  relations and focuses on theories of empire in global history, in particular  the constitutive qualities of imperial practices; trans-imperial networks and  regional integration; hierarchy and international orders; and globalization as  a historical phenomenon. At New York University he works with Lauren Benton and  his dissertation, examining inter-imperial relations in the colonial Caribbean,  is entitled \u201cIn a Sea of Empires: Networks and Crossings in the Leeward  Islands, 1783-1834.\u201d           Jeppe  has published in The Journal of Global History, co-authored a piece in a  forthcoming anthology on spatial history, and presented ongoing research at a  number of conferences, including the International Studies Association, the  Society of Early Americanists, and the Millennium Conference at the LSE. Before  embarking upon his doctoral studies, he worked on political affairs at the  Permanent Mission of Denmark to the United Nations in New York.  N  O              Mairin Odle      I am a  Ph.D. candidate in Atlantic history, with particular interests in  cross-cultural encounters, race, gender, and histories of the body in early  America.           My  dissertation, \u201cStories Written on the Body: Cross-Cultural Markings in the  North American Atlantic, 1600-1830\u201d, examines the role of permanent body  modifications in early American conceptions of cultural difference and personal  identity. In my research, I investigate  how cross-cultural contact between Native American, European, and African  societies in 17th- and 18th-century North America could alter individuals\u2019  physical appearances in profound ways\u2014focusing on three types of marks:  scalping, tattooing, and branding. These marks were connected by their  painful origins, the physical intimacy their infliction demanded, and their  symbolic, storytelling power. Tracing the experiences of marked  individuals, as well as the stories told about them, I demonstrate how  contested ideas about the nature of human and societal difference\u2014which played  out in diplomacy as well as violent conflict, captivity, and  enslavement\u2014actually reshaped early American bodies. Those reshaped  bodies in turn, I argue, were key to establishing (or disrupting) the material  reality of such ideas, particularly those emerging in the eighteenth century  about permanent and racialized physical identity.            Currently a Mellon Dissertation  Fellow in History here at NYU, I have held fellowships at the McNeil Center for  Early American Studies, the Newberry Library, the John Carter Brown Library,  the American Antiquarian Society, and the Library Company of Philadelphia and  Historical Society of Pennsylvania. My  work has appeared in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography , as  well as The Appendix and The Atlantic .               Alison K. Okuda      Alison  K. Okuda entered the doctoral program in African Diaspora History in 2009 and,  along the way, she was awarded a M.Phil. in History. Under the guidance of  Michael Gomez, she is currently writing her dissertation, entitled \u201cCaribbean  and African Exchanges: The Post-Colonial Transformation of Ghanaian Music,  Identity, and Social Structure.\u201d It questions the meaning of pan-Africanism for  individuals in Ghana and the Caribbean through a look at inter-community  relations in the music scenes of London and Accra during the mid-twentieth  century. Focusing on how these people experienced a variety of music and  cultures demonstrates that popular conceptions of pan-Africanism in Ghana were  expansive and included the African diaspora. Such an inclusive attitude subsequently  influenced Ghanaian policies and institutions during the process of nation  building. In addition to her research fields in African Diaspora, West African,  and cultural history, Alison has research and teaching interests in Caribbean,  African American, and migration studies.           Ms.  Okuda has been an active member of the history department through such  activities as the African/Diaspora Student Workshop, which she co-created, the  Graduate History Teaching Collaborative, which she also co-created and has  continued to serve on its organizing committee, and the Africa-Diaspora Forum,  a faculty-led program for which she is the current assistant. Recently, she has  taught such courses as \u201cAfrica: History and Culture\u201d at Concordia  University-Wisconsin and \u201cNarratives of Cultural Exchange in African Diaspora  History\u201d at NYU, as well as led discussions as a Teaching Assistant for  \u201cCultures and Contexts: Global Asia.\u201d Her commitment to teaching is further  supported by her publications in the history department-funded Graduate  Teaching Handbook and the journal Metropolitan  Archivist under the title, \u201cDual Uses of the Archives: Critical Moments in  Researching and Teaching\u201d (Summer 2013). Alison has also presented her work in  range of spaces, from the African/Diaspora Student Workshop to international  conferences convened by the Ghana Studies Association, the Association of  Caribbean Historians, and the Association for the Study of the Worldwide  African Diaspora.   P  Q  R            Gabriel de Avilez Rocha           Advisor:  Lauren Benton           I am a  PhD Candidate specializing in the legal and environmental history of the early  modern Iberian Atlantic. My interests include comparative colonial Americas,  slavery and capitalism, ethnohistory, and empires in world history. Other interests  involve political ecology, actor-network theory, and global intellectual  history.           My  dissertation, titled \u201cEmpires Made Flesh: Commons in the Macaronesian Atlantic,  1450-1600\u201d investigates the intersections between communal resource  arrangements and Iberian imperial escalation in the early modern Atlantic  world. It focuses on the Macaronesian archipelagos (the Azores, Madeira, the  Canaries, and Cape Verde) as crossroads between Iberia, Northern Europe, the  African Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Americas. I study instances of  conflict and cooperation over extractive industries related to lumber,  minerals, plants, water, fish, and animals, alongside contemporaneous  initiatives of slaving, plunder, and colonization. Through local and regional  developments, I seek to understand how individuals and collectives from diverse  social and ethnic backgrounds sought profit and sustenance in the early modern  Atlantic.

Concentrating on civic education curricula, pedagogic techniques, and   literacy campaigns, my work explores how different regimes aimed at   forming citizens for specific conceptions of society and polity. The   narrative is based on a combination of archival research and personal   accounts accessed through oral histories from over seventy interviews   conducted with former students, teachers, professors, inspectors,   literacy educators, political activists, and government   officials--including the two most important ministers of education of   the 1976-1983 dictatorship. In this way, my dissertation assesses how a   number of people, with varying degrees of political commitment ranging   from armed training to relative apathy, lived through turbulent times,   responded to various political projects, and worked to influence   political outcomes.

Her dissertation, \u201cA  Trade of Their Own: Market Women, Insurgent Economies, and the Making of Caribbean  Freedom, 1800-1888,\u201d examines the economic practices of enslaved and free black  women in the context of the nineteenth century transition from slavery to  freedom. This work traces the development of the economies of the enslaved from  the marketing of surplus produce from individual and family provision grounds  to the feeding of entire colonies and the formation of plebian transimperial  trading networks in the Caribbean basin. \u2018A Trade of Their Own\u2019 argues that though  this informal economy subsidized slave society by reducing the costs of social  reproduction, the female-centered markets of Atlantic world were also multi-faceted  institutions that fostered an ethos of black autonomy conducive to rebellion and  antagonistic to the worst aspects of slavery\u2019s exploitation .          Shauna has taught history courses on Africa, global Asia,  Latin America and the Caribbean, and the black Atlantic.
