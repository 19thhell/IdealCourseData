Moderated by expert faculty, these seminars enable participants to pursue their creative and intellectual interests not necessarily covered in the core curriculum.   Unless otherwise noted these seminars are open to the entire NYU community; however, as the MSPHM is a component of the Office of Student Affairs, medical students are given first priority. It is our experience that the inter-professional format of our seminars fosters personal and professional development for all involved with the program.   The Humanistic Medicine Seminars are free of charge.   All seminars require pre-registration in order to attend.   Seminars have enrollment limits, and waitlists will be available for those seminars that reach capacity.   While participation is optional, continuity is important. Prior to registering for a seminar, please ensure that you are able to attend all of the sessions.   If, at any point, you choose to drop a seminar, you must notify the Master Scholars Program in Humanistic Medicine.   Humanistic Medicine Seminars   Music and Medicine  Facilitator: \u00a0Michael Tanner, MD Description:\u00a0 This seminar will explore how disease affects the composition and performance of music. We will study the ways in which deafness influenced Beethoven\u2019s late period, particularly the five Late Quartets. We will explore the influence of blindness on the music of Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles. Other topics will include the interconnections between music and mental illness, music and substance abuse, and music as medicine (e.g., as a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease). The sessions will combine biographical material about the musicians with structural analysis of songs and classical pieces. Ability to read music is helpful but not required.   Art and Anatomy  Facilitator:\u00a0 Laura Ferguson Website: \u00a0 http://lauraferguson.net Description:\u00a0 Drawing sessions held in the Anatomy Lab. This is an opportunity to learn anatomy in an alternate mode, to become a better observer, to enhance 3D/spatial understanding of the inner body, and to focus on the individuality of each anatomical structure. Those with a visual learning style will find drawing a valuable adjunct to dissection. Those with any level of drawing experience, including beginners, are welcome: the emphasis will be on the process itself. We will also look at a variety of visual representations of the inner body, including anatomical art, medical illustration, fine art, and medical imagery, and consider how they shape the way doctors and patients think about the body. Supplies provided by the Master Scholars Program in Humanistic Medicine.   Health and Poverty Facilitator:\u00a0 Babak Tofighi, M.D. Description: \u00a0In recent years, there has been a shift in attention towards underground or illicit economies, its culprits, and its victims. News and popular media vividly depict the exploits of sex slavery, drug trafficking, and undocumented migrants in a world treading into unprecedented extremes and velocities of poverty. As clinicians, we commonly work with these survivors in the hopes of addressing their immediate needs. However our clinical encounters and treatments are often limited in time, space, and to the individual. Where do we begin in understanding marginalized communities? Can we imagine alternative forms or providing care that go beyond the individual? How can we translate existing evidence into population wide strategies? This seminar will explore poverty and the heterogeneity of various sub-populations of \u201cpoor,\u201d concepts emerging from community based models of healthcare, and how they influence a complex array of health outcomes. Guest speakers will include community organizers and healthcare providers that will explore existing alternative models in New York City.   Literature and Addiction Facilitators:\u00a0 Katie Grogan, D.M.H., M.A. &amp; Joe Nissenfeld, M.D. Description:\u00a0 This seminar examines the disease of addiction through the lens of literature. Substance abuse disorders afflict tens of millions of Americans and have long captured the fascination of both the public and scholars from diverse disciplines. Addiction figures prominently in literature, with many literary works featuring alcoholic or drug-abusing characters, numerous narrative plots driven by addictive behavior or codependent relationships, and prominent texts written by prolific authors who themselves struggled with alcohol or drug dependence. Through careful textual analysis and close readings of short stories, personal essays, and excerpts of novels and memoirs, we will explore the insights literature offers into the many complexities and multi-dimensions of addiction. We will also discuss the neurobiological underpinnings of addiction and how this can manifest subjectively for someone in the midst of the addictive process. This seminar interweaves literary, historical, cultural, and medical discourses on addiction for a truly interdisciplinary conversation on this topic.   Writing from the Inside Facilitators:\u00a0 Madeleine Beckman Description:\u00a0 In the context of Medical Humanities, writing has a purpose. In the case of this course, it will involve sorting out ideas, feelings, awareness, and analysis. The writing you will do in this course may offer a means of becoming clearer about something. For example, you might use Writing from the Inside Out to consider the kind of career direction that you might take, or how to better go about dealing with a difficult patient or colleague. The course focuses on structured writing with a beginning, middle and end, but constantly changing as your awareness of the subject changes. The class will include on-going writing exercises, readings, and discussions with the final goal of completing a coherent piece of writing of publishable quality. We\u2019ll look at the following genres: poetry, memoir, fiction, and nonfiction.   Foundations of Medicine Facilitator: \u00a0David Oshinsky, PhD. &amp; Art Caplan, M.D. Description: \u00a0The foundations of modern medicine are rooted in the philosophies and historical events that have shaped our world over hundreds of years. This seminar will examine how theories of disease evolve in medicine and healthcare, the nature of evidence, the definitions of health and disease, and the relationship between public health and clinical medicine. Students will explore medicine as both an art and a science through the unique lens of philosophical theory and historical background.   Registration Deadline: TBD                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]}]
