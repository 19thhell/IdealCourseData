The work will build upon a physical property theorized by Albert Einstein and his colleague Satyendra Nath Bose\u2014a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate (BEC), which is a state of matter of a boson, or elementary particle, once it is cooled.   Under the five-year ERC grant, Dvali and his collaborator, Cesar Gomez, a professor at Madrid\u2019s Instituto de F\u00b4\u0131sica Te\u00b4orica, will seek to determine if black holes possess matter marked by the properties outlined by Einstein and Bose.   Such a finding would upend our understanding of black holes and, more significantly, potentially alter our conception of gravity and, with it, the space-time model\u2014a fundamental aspect of the laws of physics that govern our Universe.   \u201cThough black holes are perhaps the most mysterious objects in physics,\u201d Dvali explains, \u201cwe do know they are remarkably efficient in diversifying their appearances in an incredible number of so-called quantum micro-states. That is, a black hole that, for an outside observer, appears as one large object is, in reality, composed of a huge variety of forms, only distinguishable by the make-up and organization of microscopic particles. For example, a black hole as light as a few single-celled amoebas would have billions of distinct quantum \u2018faces\u2019!\u201d     However, he adds, the underlying quantum physics that allows the black holes to be so efficient remains unknown.     But, Dvali and Gomez believe, after receiving relevant literature in the field, that they may have insights into understanding black-hole properties. They have theorized that black holes are a collection of Bose-Einstein condensates.     \u201cThis is an interesting and surprising phenomenon of nature because we usually associate \u2018quantumness\u2019 only with microscopic objects,\u201d says Dvali. \u201cFor example, we usually think that small objects are quantum whereas large objects, such as elephants, are classical\u2014that is, they are well-described by laws of classical physics.     \u201cBut, black holes prove this intuition wrong, meaning its properties cannot be properly understood because their make-up does not conform to the laws of classical physics. In other words, we need to be viewing them as we would a microscopic object rather than as something significantly larger.\u201d     Their project will develop a detailed application of their concept to various aspects of black hole physics in order to find support for the theory.

The study was carried out primarily by Glennys Farrar and Sjoert van Velzen at New York University\u2019s Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, and also included the following researchers: Suvi Gezari of Johns Hopkins University's Department of Physics and Astronomy; Linda Ostman of Spain\u2019s Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona; Nidia Morrell of the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile; Dennis Zaritsky of the University of Arizona; Matthew Smith of South Africa\u2019s University of Cape Town; Joseph Gelfand of NYU-Abu Dhabi; and Andrew Drake of Caltech. Van Velzen is currently a doctoral candidate at Radboud University in the Netherlands.   Cosmologists have calculated that, on occasion, a star\u2019s orbit will be disturbed in such a way that it passes very near the super-massive black hole at the center of its galaxy\u2014but not so close that it is captured whole. Such a star will be torn apart by the extreme tidal forces it experiences: the force of gravity on the near side of the star is so much stronger than that on the far side that the gravitational force holding the star together is overwhelmed, causing the star to simply come apart. While some of the star\u2019s matter falls into the black hole, much of it continues in chaotic orbits, crashing into itself and producing intense radiation lasting days to months. These phenomena are called stellar tidal disruption flares, or TDFs.   Although discovering evidence of TDFs has been a high priority of astrophysicists for many years, and several possible examples have been found using X-ray and UV satellites, discovering TDFs in a large-scale, systematic survey using ground-based optical telescopes as has now been achieved, is critical to controlling bias and avoiding misidentifications.   The difficulty in detecting TDFs is largely due to the challenge of distinguishing them from more common types of flares such as supernovae. (For every TDF there are about 1000 supernovae.) In addition, some super-massive black holes have an \u201caccretion disk\u201d surrounding them\u2014gas and dust, often left from an earlier merger with another galaxy\u2014which is continuously feeding the hole. Such accreting black holes are usually evident from the bright emission they produce and are known as quasars or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, a hiccup in the accretion of an undetected active black hole could produce a flare that might be mistakenly identified as a TDF.   The researchers on the Astrophysical Journal study uncovered sound evidence for the presence of two TDFs through a rigorous analysis of archival data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).   To do so, they sifted through voluminous SDSS data, in which more than 2 million galaxies were repeatedly observed over 10 years. By very carefully registering the images and looking at differences between consecutive images, they obtained a sample of 342 intense and well-measured flares.   Of these, almost all could be classified into supernovae and AGN flares. However, two cases were left that did not fit either classification. By relying on multi-year observations, the researchers could see that the two flares\u2019 host galaxies showed no other flaring activity, as would be the case if the flares came from a hidden variable AGN. This means the possibility these two flares were produced by undetected AGNs is extremely small.   In addition, the researchers located these flares at the nucleus of their galaxy with high precision, which reduces the likelihood that they are supernovae to less than 1 percent since supernovae are randomly distributed through galaxies.   Finally, the properties of these flares are very different from flares of AGNs and supernovae\u2014and their spectra are unlike any supernovae observed to date. Supernovae flares are characteristically very blue at first but become red as they cool and rapidly decay, whereas the TDF flares are very blue throughout\u2014slowly decaying without changing color. This behavior is consistent with expectations for a TDF\u2014the debris from the star should rapidly form an accretion disk and look like a short-lived AGN.   Sjoert van Velzen, the study\u2019s lead author, was a Dutch first-year graduate student who came to NYU to work under the direction of Glennys Farrar, a Professor of Physics at NYU and senior scientist of the project. Van Velzen is now completing his Ph. D. in Holland.   About his first encounter with real scientific work, van Velzen says, \u201cSearching through 2.6 million galaxies was actually a lot of fun\u2014there is so much to discover! Based on our search criteria and observing two TDFs that met those criteria, the rate of TDFs is about once per 100,000 years, per galaxy. It\u2019s quite thrilling to have been able to make such a measurement.\u201d   \u201cThe next step is to develop models to explain in detail the flares\u2019 properties and duration, and address the question of whether TDFs could be responsible for producing Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays, whose sources have been elusive up to now,\u201d says Farrar. \u201cIt is very exciting that we are on the verge of obtaining a large and better-observed sample of TDFs to study\u2014though a more sensitive search of SDSS archival data and the new generation of transient surveys which will observe more flares in real-time and with multi-wavelength follow-up. A large sample will be invaluable to understanding many outstanding questions in astrophysics.\u201d                          This Press Release is in the following Topics:      Arts and Science , Research , Faculty           Type: Press Release            Press Contact:                James Devitt | (212) 998-6808                                            Astrophysicists have found evidence of black holes destroying stars, a long-sought phenomenon that provides a new window into general relativity.

The work will build upon a physical property theorized by Albert Einstein and his colleague Satyendra Nath Bose\u2014a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate (BEC), which is a state of matter of a boson, or elementary particle, once it is cooled.   Under the five-year ERC grant, Dvali and his collaborator, Cesar Gomez, a professor at Madrid\u2019s Instituto de F\u00b4\u0131sica Te\u00b4orica, will seek to determine if black holes possess matter marked by the properties outlined by Einstein and Bose.   Such a finding would upend our understanding of black holes and, more significantly, potentially alter our conception of gravity and, with it, the space-time model\u2014a fundamental aspect of the laws of physics that govern our Universe.   \u201cThough black holes are perhaps the most mysterious objects in physics,\u201d Dvali explains, \u201cwe do know they are remarkably efficient in diversifying their appearances in an incredible number of so-called quantum micro-states. That is, a black hole that, for an outside observer, appears as one large object is, in reality, composed of a huge variety of forms, only distinguishable by the make-up and organization of microscopic particles. For example, a black hole as light as a few single-celled amoebas would have billions of distinct quantum \u2018faces\u2019!\u201d     However, he adds, the underlying quantum physics that allows the black holes to be so efficient remains unknown.     But, Dvali and Gomez believe, after receiving relevant literature in the field, that they may have insights into understanding black-hole properties. They have theorized that black holes are a collection of Bose-Einstein condensates.     \u201cThis is an interesting and surprising phenomenon of nature because we usually associate \u2018quantumness\u2019 only with microscopic objects,\u201d says Dvali. \u201cFor example, we usually think that small objects are quantum whereas large objects, such as elephants, are classical\u2014that is, they are well-described by laws of classical physics.     \u201cBut, black holes prove this intuition wrong, meaning its properties cannot be properly understood because their make-up does not conform to the laws of classical physics. In other words, we need to be viewing them as we would a microscopic object rather than as something significantly larger.\u201d     Their project will develop a detailed application of their concept to various aspects of black hole physics in order to find support for the theory.

The research, reported in the latest issue of the Astrophysical Journal, also opens up a method to search for the possible existence of a large population of presently undetectable \u201cintermediate mass\u201d black holes which are hypothesized to be precursors to the super-massive black holes at the centers of most large galaxies.   The study was carried out primarily by Glennys Farrar and Sjoert van Velzen at New York University\u2019s Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, and also included the following researchers: Suvi Gezari of Johns Hopkins University's Department of Physics and Astronomy; Linda Ostman of Spain\u2019s Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona; Nidia Morrell of the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile; Dennis Zaritsky of the University of Arizona; Matthew Smith of South Africa\u2019s University of Cape Town; Joseph Gelfand of NYU-Abu Dhabi; and Andrew Drake of Caltech. Van Velzen is currently a doctoral candidate at Radboud University in the Netherlands.   Cosmologists have calculated that, on occasion, a star\u2019s orbit will be disturbed in such a way that it passes very near the super-massive black hole at the center of its galaxy\u2014but not so close that it is captured whole. Such a star will be torn apart by the extreme tidal forces it experiences: the force of gravity on the near side of the star is so much stronger than that on the far side that the gravitational force holding the star together is overwhelmed, causing the star to simply come apart. While some of the star\u2019s matter falls into the black hole, much of it continues in chaotic orbits, crashing into itself and producing intense radiation lasting days to months. These phenomena are called stellar tidal disruption flares, or TDFs.   Although discovering evidence of TDFs has been a high priority of astrophysicists for many years, and several possible examples have been found using X-ray and UV satellites, discovering TDFs in a large-scale, systematic survey using ground-based optical telescopes as has now been achieved, is critical to controlling bias and avoiding misidentifications.   The difficulty in detecting TDFs is largely due to the challenge of distinguishing them from more common types of flares such as supernovae. (For every TDF there are about 1000 supernovae.) In addition, some super-massive black holes have an \u201caccretion disk\u201d surrounding them\u2014gas and dust, often left from an earlier merger with another galaxy\u2014which is continuously feeding the hole. Such accreting black holes are usually evident from the bright emission they produce and are known as quasars or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, a hiccup in the accretion of an undetected active black hole could produce a flare that might be mistakenly identified as a TDF.   The researchers on the Astrophysical Journal study uncovered sound evidence for the presence of two TDFs through a rigorous analysis of archival data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).   To do so, they sifted through voluminous SDSS data, in which more than 2 million galaxies were repeatedly observed over 10 years. By very carefully registering the images and looking at differences between consecutive images, they obtained a sample of 342 intense and well-measured flares.   Of these, almost all could be classified into supernovae and AGN flares. However, two cases were left that did not fit either classification. By relying on multi-year observations, the researchers could see that the two flares\u2019 host galaxies showed no other flaring activity, as would be the case if the flares came from a hidden variable AGN. This means the possibility these two flares were produced by undetected AGNs is extremely small.   In addition, the researchers located these flares at the nucleus of their galaxy with high precision, which reduces the likelihood that they are supernovae to less than 1 percent since supernovae are randomly distributed through galaxies.   Finally, the properties of these flares are very different from flares of AGNs and supernovae\u2014and their spectra are unlike any supernovae observed to date. Supernovae flares are characteristically very blue at first but become red as they cool and rapidly decay, whereas the TDF flares are very blue throughout\u2014slowly decaying without changing color. This behavior is consistent with expectations for a TDF\u2014the debris from the star should rapidly form an accretion disk and look like a short-lived AGN.   Sjoert van Velzen, the study\u2019s lead author, was a Dutch first-year graduate student who came to NYU to work under the direction of Glennys Farrar, a Professor of Physics at NYU and senior scientist of the project. Van Velzen is now completing his Ph. D. in Holland.   About his first encounter with real scientific work, van Velzen says, \u201cSearching through 2.6 million galaxies was actually a lot of fun\u2014there is so much to discover! Based on our search criteria and observing two TDFs that met those criteria, the rate of TDFs is about once per 100,000 years, per galaxy. It\u2019s quite thrilling to have been able to make such a measurement.\u201d   \u201cThe next step is to develop models to explain in detail the flares\u2019 properties and duration, and address the question of whether TDFs could be responsible for producing Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays, whose sources have been elusive up to now,\u201d says Farrar. \u201cIt is very exciting that we are on the verge of obtaining a large and better-observed sample of TDFs to study\u2014though a more sensitive search of SDSS archival data and the new generation of transient surveys which will observe more flares in real-time and with multi-wavelength follow-up. A large sample will be invaluable to understanding many outstanding questions in astrophysics.\u201d                          This Press Release is in the following Topics:      Arts and Science , Research , Faculty           Type: Press Release            Press Contact:                James Devitt | (212) 998-6808                                            Astrophysicists have found evidence of black holes destroying stars, a long-sought phenomenon that provides a new window into general relativity.

Post                                      Newer Post &raquo;                                              Article                                                            Every second, intense beams of maser emission (like laser emission but at radio frequencies) arrive on Earth from clouds of water vapor orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun, at centers of galaxies hundreds of millions of light years away. Ingyin Zaw, assistant professor of Physics at NYU Abu Dhabi, is using the largest and best radio telescopes in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres to tease out information from these maser systems in the attempt to unravel the nature and behavior of their host SMBHs.                      Although SMBHs are only a small fraction of the total mass of the galaxies they inhabit, their growth and evolution are intimately linked with that of their host galaxies across cosmic time. A key in regulating this relationship is the process of accretion \u2014 how gas and dust from the galaxy falls into the SMBH \u2014 and outflows \u2014 material that is driven from the vicinity of the SMBH. Both accretion and outflows influence physical processes, like star formation, in the host galaxy.   Water masers occupy a unique location within a few light months to a few light years of the SMBH. They are in a region where the gravity of the SMBH dominates over that of the galaxy. From their location and motion, many properties of the SMBH and surrounding material can be deduced, including the mass of the SMBH, the geometry and temperature of the material around the SMBH, the shape of outflows, and the distance to the host galaxy.   &quot;I'm amazed at how well we can study objects so far away,&quot; said the Burmese-born, Harvard-educated Zaw. The maser emission, up to hundreds of millions times weaker than the average TV signal, is discovered by large single-dish telescopes, approximately 100-meter versions of rooftop satellite dishes. Then, using very long baseline interferometry \u2014 a group of telescopes that spread out over the Earth but act as one \u2014 astronomers are able to image the individual maser clumps. The resolution produced by this method is the equivalent on Earth of being able to see the face of a person standing on the moon.   In addition, Zaw wants to combine this information with data of light emitted at other frequencies, since different physical processes at different locations near the SMBH emit at different frequencies. This way, she will be able to disentangle the complex physical conditions near the SMBH, then build models and compare them to theoretical predictions.                                                                              I'm amazed at how well we can study objects so far away.         Ingyin Zaw, NYUAD assistant professor of Physics.                         Zaw was in Australia in April 2014 to work with the Southern Hemisphere's largest radio telescope, the 70-meter Tidbinbilla antenna, a part of NASA's Deep Space Network, near Canberra. She and Lincoln Greenhill, a senior researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, are co-principal investigators on the Tidbinbilla AGN Maser Survey, known as TAMS. The seven-person team, which spans three continents, comprises Zaw's postdoctoral researcher Aquib Moin and collaborators at Australian National University's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex. The arrangement is ideal for splitting up observing sessions that can be scheduled for any time, day or night, said Zaw. She is also excited to supervise research projects of NYUAD students using the data from the TAMS project.   Zaw and two other NYUAD Physics faculty, Visiting Professor of Practice of Physics Mallory Roberts and Assistant Professor of Physics Joseph Gelfand, are also working on a partnership with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia, to conduct maser and pulsar observations.   The Australian project has been allotted 1,200 hours of telescope time to be spread out over the next few years. During her April 2014 trip, Zaw calibrated the instrument and prepared to begin the first year of study, designated as a pilot phase. &quot;We need cold dry nights,&quot; she said, and the Australian winter fits that requirement.   &quot;When it's all set up,&quot; she added, her tone revealing her enthusiasm for the project, &quot;I'll be able to sit in my office at NYU Abu Dhabi and control the telescope remotely. It is truly a privilege.&quot;   Zaw cites a quote from the poem &quot;Planetarium&quot; by Adrienne Rich that inspires her:   I am bombarded yet I stand  I have been standing all my life in the  direct path of a battery of signals  the most accurately transmitted most  untranslatable language in the universe  [\u2026]  I am an instrument in the shape  of a woman trying to translate pulsations  into images for the relief of the body  and the reconstruction of the mind.
