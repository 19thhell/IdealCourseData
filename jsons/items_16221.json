Need:\u00a0 Identity API\u2019s (map Stern ID\u2019s to NYU ID\u2019s)   Van:\u00a0 not \u201cmobile first,\u201d but \u201cweb services first\u201d   Model the data, model the content, and give it to the devs   Lack of awareness of existing services that is available and discoverable (a clearinghouse or directory)   Existing examples at other universities:    \u00a0 https://webfeeds.princeton.edu/   http://webservices.washington.edu /       How can central IT support this?     Standards   Data interchanges formats   Templates       There are services that can provide a API \u201cmiddleware\u201d that helps manage access   If we started an NYU directory, then it would be up to each service- or data-owner to volunteer their service as appropriate   Stern has no public APIs, currently   Wagner has no public APIs, currently   Culture change vs. manate   There are students interested in access to NYU API\u2019s who are also pushing this issue (see http://createabetternyu.com/ )   Must be careful to avoid API crush on services that degrades the service for people who need it   What are some of the most-desired APIs?    classes/course catalog   LMS (NYU Classes)   Majors/minors   Identity platform (profiles)       The more APIs available, the more opportunities there are for mashups   Ideally, put up a directory populated with info from systems of record and let users populated additional fields   Should we start a thread on TorchTech about this?   Matt Morgan:\u00a0 we need an NYU Reddit   Barriers:    People not willing   Systems not able       Have pioneers provide utility, find easy wins, and model the success   Perhaps training or partnership with a company that can help us establish best practices   Student hackathon even resorted to screen scraping for data   CIO Council to continue discussing   If we created a directory:    Use Google Sites or Forms to collect    Service   URL   Link to documentation   Owner/lead              #TorchTech Stories   As a Result of Today&#8230;   Photos   Session Notes   Video: Clay Shirky   Attendees       Join Us!
