Amid her identity crisis during college years, God could finally capture her through His Word, bringing her deep peace and assurance that her ultimate identity is in Christ. Though she was studying in Wesleyan University, the very place she had the first life-changing Bible study was NYU. It is her joy to now engage with NYU students and worship together as a spiritual family. Ruth considers every activity of life as worship, and especially her kitchen as another sanctuary. Besides cooking, she enjoys sports--basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, swimming...you name it. Just as she was fascinated and transformed by the Bible, Ruth hopes to share the eye-opening experiences of God's Word with NYU students who will be the world changers.

Frederick Lothers , FOCUS  frederick.lothers@focus.org  Frederick grew up in a military family, moving constantly, not truly having one particular place to call \u2018home\u2019 in the way other people meant it. He's lived in Germany, Kansas, California (two times), Alaska, Texas (two times), and Virginia. He is an only child, which means much of his life has been defined by his mom, Mary, his dad, John, and his dog, Skipper. One of the tougher aspects of that part of his life was dealing with his father\u2019s four deployments to Iraq: once during Operation Desert Storm, and three times during Operation Iraqi Freedom. So much moving also means that he's attended many different schools during his life--including three high schools, and two community colleges before finishing his associates\u2019 degree. In 2011, after completing his associates\u2019 degree in Northern Virginia, he began attending the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Felipe Rufes Vazquez,  felipe.vazquez@nyu.edu  M y name is Felipe Rufes Vazquez, I was born on September 13th, 1954, in Avila, a very old and small city in Spain. I grew in a farm although I did not become a farmer because my parents wanted me to study. I completed my educational formation in Madrid and later in Buenos Aires (Argentina) where I lived for about twelve years. Early in my life, I discovered my vocation to help and as a result I joined a Catholic religious community, the Idente Missionaries, founded in Spain in 1959. As member of this community, I have had the opportunity of visiting several countries including Argentina, Colombia, Check Republic, Poland, Thailand, China, Philippines and the United States. It was in New York (at Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral) where I was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1999. I have spent about forty years teaching, mainly Spanish Language together with Spanish Literature, History and Philosophy. My last professorship in this field was at the University of the Philippines, in Quezon City (Metro Manila), where I worked for twelve years. I love mountains and enjoy spending time immersed in nature finding myself in full harmony with it. Nature always produces in my soul a renewed astonishment. I also like to travel rural roads and taste and enjoy the typical products of each place. Among the plastic arts, I prefer painting and particularly the beauty of icons. Presently, I am helping my religious community in the parish of Our Lady of Loreto, in the Diocese of Rockville Center and I have the pleasure of serving as the Catholic Chaplain at POLY-NYU.

Hindu Chaplains                               Joseph Caruso , Hindu Campus Ministry  ghanasyamdas@yahoo.com  Joe Caruso was born in April of 1978 in Red Bank, NJ. From a young age he was deeply attracted to classical music and began playing the piano at about the age of 10. He pursued classical music throughout high school and into college where he studied with Dr. Min Kim and earned a degree in Music Education. However, during his last two years, a shift in his interest took place which he considered to be a natural progression from the Arts to Religion. Classical Music always put him in touch with the sublime and the sublimity of life itself. This led to a lot of deeper questions about himself, life, and God. He enthusiastically started reading many spiritual and holy books. It became such a passion for him that he began exploring and visiting various monasteries. After graduating college he had planned to live in one such monastery (Krishna Bhakti asrama, located in the lower east side of Manhattan) for one month before beginning his career. But he never left. He has been happily living there in the association of ten other monks for nine years now. Some student friends of his at NYU started a spiritual club on campus and invited him to give some classes. Since then he has had many wonderful relationships with students and faculty at NYU, and the cooking classes and Bhagavad Gita study groups have continued through the years.

Pandit currently lives in the Lower East Side of Manhattan where he serves as a priest and lecturer. He is also the Hindu chaplain at Columbia University and the Interfaith chaplain at Union Theological Seminary.

Yashan (Ruth) Zhou , Youth Evangelical Fellowship  ruthinthetruth@gmail.com  Ruth spent the first 6 years of her life in China, the next 12 years in Japan and the next 10+ years in the U.S. While her family members were all atheists, God was always a part of her life, mysteriously placing Christians all around her since childhood. Amid her identity crisis during college years, God could finally capture her through His Word, bringing her deep peace and assurance that her ultimate identity is in Christ. Though she was studying in Wesleyan University, the very place she had the first life-changing Bible study was NYU. It is her joy to now engage with NYU students and worship together as a spiritual family. Ruth considers every activity of life as worship, and especially her kitchen as another sanctuary. Besides cooking, she enjoys sports--basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, swimming...you name it. Just as she was fascinated and transformed by the Bible, Ruth hopes to share the eye-opening experiences of God's Word with NYU students who will be the world changers.

He's lived in Germany, Kansas, California (two times), Alaska, Texas (two times), and Virginia.

Felipe Rufes Vazquez,  felipe.vazquez@nyu.edu  M y name is Felipe Rufes Vazquez, I was born on September 13th, 1954, in Avila, a very old and small city in Spain. I grew in a farm although I did not become a farmer because my parents wanted me to study. I completed my educational formation in Madrid and later in Buenos Aires (Argentina) where I lived for about twelve years. Early in my life, I discovered my vocation to help and as a result I joined a Catholic religious community, the Idente Missionaries, founded in Spain in 1959. As member of this community, I have had the opportunity of visiting several countries including Argentina, Colombia, Check Republic, Poland, Thailand, China, Philippines and the United States. It was in New York (at Saint Patrick\u2019s Cathedral) where I was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1999. I have spent about forty years teaching, mainly Spanish Language together with Spanish Literature, History and Philosophy. My last professorship in this field was at the University of the Philippines, in Quezon City (Metro Manila), where I worked for twelve years. I love mountains and enjoy spending time immersed in nature finding myself in full harmony with it. Nature always produces in my soul a renewed astonishment. I also like to travel rural roads and taste and enjoy the typical products of each place. Among the plastic arts, I prefer painting and particularly the beauty of icons. Presently, I am helping my religious community in the parish of Our Lady of Loreto, in the Diocese of Rockville Center and I have the pleasure of serving as the Catholic Chaplain at POLY-NYU.

Hindu Chaplains                               Joseph Caruso , Hindu Campus Ministry  ghanasyamdas@yahoo.com  Joe Caruso was born in April of 1978 in Red Bank, NJ. From a young age he was deeply attracted to classical music and began playing the piano at about the age of 10. He pursued classical music throughout high school and into college where he studied with Dr. Min Kim and earned a degree in Music Education. However, during his last two years, a shift in his interest took place which he considered to be a natural progression from the Arts to Religion. Classical Music always put him in touch with the sublime and the sublimity of life itself. This led to a lot of deeper questions about himself, life, and God. He enthusiastically started reading many spiritual and holy books. It became such a passion for him that he began exploring and visiting various monasteries. After graduating college he had planned to live in one such monastery (Krishna Bhakti asrama, located in the lower east side of Manhattan) for one month before beginning his career. But he never left. He has been happily living there in the association of ten other monks for nine years now. Some student friends of his at NYU started a spiritual club on campus and invited him to give some classes. Since then he has had many wonderful relationships with students and faculty at NYU, and the cooking classes and Bhagavad Gita study groups have continued through the years.

Cooper                                                                Printer Friendly Version                       One morning last year, Karen Freedman \u201980 took a short walk from her offices on Lafayette Street in lower Manhattan to the white granite fortress that is the Manhattan Family Court. Freedman is the unassuming yet powerful executive director of Lawyers For Children (LFC), and her history with the court spans 30 years and thousands of proceedings. On this day, she peeked in on a juvenile hearing in progress. What she saw made the calm and steady Freedman, in her own words, \u201cabsolutely crazy.\u201d   A teenage girl, clenching her lawyer\u2019s business card between her teeth, stood with her hands shackled behind her back.   The scene set off Freedman\u2019s highly attuned sense of injustice. Who handcuffs children? It was degrading, inhumane, and unconstitutional\u2014and occurring in front of her eyes. Still, as always, Freedman turned indignation into strategy.   After the hearing, Freedman launched an investigation. She asked the girl\u2019s attorney about the handcuffs; surveyed her staff of some 65 other lawyers and social workers; and called the head of another Manhattan nonprofit, the Center for Family Representation (CFR), to ask whether their clients, many of them teen parents, were being routinely manacled.   A bigger picture came into focus. Court officers who escorted teens charged with minor offenses from criminal to family court kept them in handcuffs during child welfare hearings. Everyone in the courthouse had become inured to the sight of children standing in manacles throughout their proceedings, Freedman learned.   Under the law, every litigant is entitled to be free of restraints unless they present a danger of violence to themselves or others. In Manhattan\u2014and in no other family court in New York City\u2014that presumption had been flipped on its head. The Lawyers For Children client had faced a marijuana charge, hardly a violent offense.   Freedman sent a demand letter to the New York Office of Court Administration, the administrative arm of the state court system, which also happens to be the source of most of her agency\u2019s funding.   The office agreed that handcuffing children had to stop. Freedman\u2019s lawyers began to demand that their nonviolent clients be free of restraints. Still, nearly a year later, the practice continued.   \u201cIt\u2019s like pushing against Jell-O,\u201d says Freedman, seated in her big-windowed, award-filled corner office that looks out onto the Tombs, as the Manhattan Detention Complex is known. \u201cNo one will say that this should be happening. They say, \u2018You\u2019re absolutely right!\u2019 And then nothing changes.\u201d   Nothing changes, that is, until Freedman grabs hold.     MICRO AND MACRO   There, in microcosm, is Freedman\u2019s modus operandi. First comes her empathic connection to a child, which often triggers her intuitive sense about a social injustice on a large scale. She investigates and finds allies, then outlines a list of demands. These are her first steps before taking legal action (if necessary) toward reform. Most effectively, perhaps, Freedman persists\u2014without bombast or bullying\u2014until she gets what she wants.   In this way, Freedman has wielded her New York University law degree as a sword for the public good: to improve, vastly, the lives of mostly poor children in foster care in New York City. If, at 60, she is as deceptively mild-mannered as Clark Kent, she is also as apparently mighty as his alter ego. Like the superhero, she is a merger of opposite traits: low-key and take-charge; steady and passionate; creative and rational; self-effacing and wickedly smart.   \u201cThere\u2019s something so centered and focused and powerful within her,\u201d says Vaughn Williams, an LFC board member. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an interesting dichotomy, because in a polite way she\u2019s very tough. She\u2019s motherly and sensitive to the kids that she\u2019s representing, but then she\u2019s also demanding and businesslike as a lawyer. And she has taken such a solid, consistent path, year after year, in an upward trajectory.\u201d   The result is a New York City foster care system that is \u201cway way better,\u201d according to Martin Guggenheim \u201971, Fiorello LaGuardia Professor of Clinical Law and a mentor of Freedman\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindboggling success story.\u201d   In addition to representing some 50,000 children in court over three decades, LFC has filed scores of class action lawsuits and appeals, almost always winning. It has shone a light on many subsets of aggrieved foster children, from those who witness domestic violence to older teens aging out of foster care to immigrants, sexual abuse survivors, and, most recently, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth.   And, from her start in 1984 with a team of two and a donated office, Freedman has built a nonprofit firm with a $7 million annual budget\u2014almost $2 million raised privately\u2014in a warren of offices on three floors. She exemplifies \u201chow a lawyer wanting to do something different and entrepreneurial and outside the mainstream of big law can build an institution,\u201d says Williams, former partner and now of counsel at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.   The surprising power of that institution derives, in part, from its ability to succeed at its micro and macro missions: helping children personally while formulating public policy. Freedman\u2019s work rests on the proposition that every child deserves a voice. Toward that end, every client at LFC is assigned a lawyer as well as a social worker, so that a trained professional examines every facet of a child\u2019s life. Relationships form and deepen. By the time the court hearing arrives, children are presented as fully dimensional people, not as cardboard cutouts of foster kids.   \u201cHer lawyers stand out,\u201d says former Family Court Judge Jody Adams, now special adviser to the commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services for Children and Families in Shelter. \u201cThey\u2019re really smart, they know the law, and they know their clients. And her social workers are equally brilliant. They often brought older children into the court who then expressed themselves to me. I came to see their clients as individuals.\u201d   LFC\u2019s young clients, in turn, serve as experts on foster care. They are eyewitnesses to a system that has left them in violent homes, removed them from loving families, and often attempted to discard them as they entered adulthood\u2014alone, jobless, and homeless.   Freedman\u2019s gift is to listen to their voices and discern trends in everyday accounts. Then she goes to work at the very top of the child welfare food chain, meeting with commissioners she has known for decades, enlisting the aid of family and state court judges who respect her work, tapping New York\u2019s prestigious law firms to lend their name\u2014and letterhead\u2014to particular fights.     ESCAPE FROM RIKERS   If a single client comes to mind for Freedman, it is Darren Martin. A brilliant student, Martin began to slip academically in 1996, when he was 15. He would threaten his classmates, and ravenously eat two free school lunches a day. Soon, his school\u2019s dean learned that Martin\u2019s mother had abandoned him for her boyfriends. He had been living alone in their Harlem apartment with no money and no food for three weeks.   The city\u2019s child welfare agency, the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, offered Martin some unappealing choices, including living in a group home\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s like dumping you in jail,\u201d Martin says\u2014or moving in with his sister in Baltimore. \u201cThe City of New York was just thinking of the quickest and easiest solution to get me off of their rolls. They clearly wanted to ship me away.\u201d   A caring teacher called LFC, and Martin met with his new social worker and lawyer. \u201cI felt understood,\u201d says Martin, who told his team that his top priority was his education. \u201cFor how angry I was, I needed someone to redistribute and articulate those feelings into something else.\u201d   Martin was placed in \u201ckinship foster care\u201d with an aunt and uncle, allowing him to complete high school. But two days after graduation, his foster parents handed him a plane ticket to Wisconsin; he was to enroll that fall at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. Until then, he had nowhere to live. \u201cThey\u2019re kicking me out of the house and I have nowhere to go,\u201d Martin told his LFC attorney.   It may as well have been the lament of every young adult who aged out of foster care in New York City, especially those placed in care voluntarily by parents who don\u2019t want them. Young adults like Martin were cast adrift without an anchor to face adulthoods as bleak as those in a modern-day Dickens novel\u2014of homelessness, prostitution, drugs, prison, or early pregnancy. One New York City study found that youths formerly in care comprised roughly one-quarter of the city\u2019s homeless shelter population.   For Freedman, Martin\u2019s case crystallized the aging-out crisis. With Legal Aid as co-counsel, she began negotiating with New York City to stop discharging foster youths into homelessness. The result, in 2011, was a sweeping court-ordered class-action settlement mandating that all foster children be released to stable housing and provided connections to jobs, further education, and at least one caring adult when they age out of the system.   In addition, Freedman led the creation of a special court, within New York City Family Court, whose sole job is to work with and track closely the well-being of foster children from age 18 until 21.   \u201cThese kids were in very bad shape,\u201d says Douglas Hoffman \u201981, supervising judge of New York County Family Court. \u201cKaren suggested a radical change. She proposed a court that could be a model nationally. We\u2019re still tweaking it, but it\u2019s really a turnaround from A to Z.\u201d   As for Martin, LFC negotiated with New York City to pay for summer housing and Martin boarded the plane to Madison, where he enrolled in a pre-college program until the fall. He graduated, then earned a master\u2019s degree, married, and became a father. Today, at 33, Martin serves as the student services coordinator in the financial aid office of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.   \u201cIf I had been fending for myself,\u201d says Martin, \u201cI probably would\u2019ve been that angry black teenager who ended up at Rikers.\u201d     DO-GOOD DNA   Freedman, an NYU School of Law trustee, is well aware of the distance between her usually penniless clients and her own privileged origins in New York City.   Freedman\u2019s energetic mother, Doris, was a crusader for art and artists. She presided over the Municipal Art Society, a private organization dedicated to landmarks preservation and New York City\u2019s building landscape, and founded the Public Art Fund, a non-profit organization dedicated to mounting contemporary art in the city\u2019s public spaces. A plaque and named plaza at the southeast corner of Central Park honor her legacy. Freedman\u2019s father, Alan, a businessman, founded the WNYC Foundation to increase private funding for public radio.   In Karen\u2019s early teens, her family moved into the Century building on Central Park West. It was designed and built by Freedman\u2019s maternal grandfather, Irwin Chanin, a New York City architect responsible for many of New York\u2019s jazziest Art Deco buildings, as well as half a dozen Broadway theaters. The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at Cooper Union memorializes his work.   In 1969, not long after that move, the New York Times published a feature showcasing the work and home of Doris, who had become New York City\u2019s first director of cultural affairs. The story, \u201cEven Buying Art Is a Democratic Process in Freedman Home,\u201d peered into the Freedmans\u2019 life, suggesting facets of wealth and influence that, Freedman says, told only part of her family\u2019s story.   Alan had grown up modestly in Brooklyn and Cleveland. He joined the Air Force, and afterward went to work rather than college to support his young family. He began selling advertising for a small New Jersey company that made desk accessories and marine instruments, working his way up steadily to become president. All along the way, Doris and Alan Freedman insisted on raising their family on their own earnings.   Freedman modeled her parents\u2019 dedication to work. In 1970, she took a job as a counselor at Camp Ramapo for Children, in Rhinebeck, New York, for kids with emotional and social disabilities. The experience would deeply affect her and influence the course of her life.   \u201cMost of the campers were inner-city kids,\u201d says Freedman, who is petite and speaks in a thoughtful cadence, without \u201cums\u201d or \u201cuhs.\u201d   The camp philosophy then was to hire counselors close in age to the campers. Freedman, at 16, had the charge of a cabin of 15-year-olds, a practice she now thinks of as \u201cinsane\u201d and legally suspect. Yet it opened her eyes.   \u201cIt was transformative,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved working with kids. I felt energized by them. They were difficult, complicated, tough kids, but that\u2019s what I knew I wanted to do. I didn\u2019t know how, I didn\u2019t know in what form, but I knew that going forward in my life I wanted to work with children.\u201d   The very idea of making a difference had been cultivated during Freedman\u2019s formative years at the progressive Ethical Culture Fieldston School, with its emphasis on social justice. The school\u2019s charge is not to teach students to adapt to the existing social order, but rather \u201cto change their environment to greater conformity with moral ideals.\u201d Three generations of Freedmans are graduates.   She found similar values at Wesleyan University, where she graduated summa cum laude, and where she met her husband, Roger Weisberg, a documentary filmmaker, whose work on social justice issues often dovetails with Freedman\u2019s. In a highly competitive field of boosters, Weisberg says he is his wife\u2019s greatest. He fell, in part, for her \u201cselflessness and compassion.\u201d He admires how she has given voice to children. He respects Freedman\u2019s agility as both adversary and ally. \u201cShe can collaborate with the very people she\u2019s dragging to court to force a reform,\u201d he says.   After college, Freedman went to work in the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office, where she came to appreciate the power of the law. She decided on law school. \u201cI felt that law school would allow me the greatest opportunity to advocate on behalf of individual children and make positive systemic change,\u201d says Freedman. \u201cThat was the trajectory that I wanted to follow.\u201d   That clarity of thought and purpose led her to become a Root- Tilden Scholar. In 1977, Freedman was one of about 20 NYU Law students selected for the program, which encourages careers in public service and public interest law. At the scholars\u2019 first meetand- greet, Freedman befriended Elaine Fink \u201980.   \u201cI was taken with her,\u201d says Fink, who is the managing attorney for children\u2019s advocacy at the Legal Aid Society of Southwest Ohio. \u201cThe way she talked about her work touched me and intrigued me. We both knew we weren\u2019t competing for the best law firm job out there. We had lofty, improve-the-world goals.\u201d   At NYU, Professor Guggenheim\u2019s seminar on Children and the Law began to shape Freedman\u2019s thinking. In his scholarship, Guggenheim has examined the unwitting harm that can occur when lawyers represent children. Under the banner of children\u2019s rights, he argues, lawyers for children often create antagonisms with parents, resulting in more broken families and more children harmed in foster care.   Freedman considers Guggenheim her most influential mentor and, at times, her most formidable ideological adversary.   \u201cThe notion of an attorney acting in the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 can be used to cause great harm and detriment to children,\u201d Freedman says. \u201cThat is why at Lawyers For Children the voice of the child is paramount. There is a social worker and a lawyer assigned to advocate for every child, and in those circumstances where a child is developmentally incapable of comprehending and participating in the court proceedings, it is the skilled social worker who will use substituted judgment to help the attorney formulate the legal strategy on that case.\u201d   But before graduating from law school, Freedman faced a series of devastating family losses. In 1979, her mother underwent routine surgery. In recovery, she stopped breathing and lapsed into a coma from which she never recovered. Two years later she died, at 53. Doris\u2019s passing was followed little more than a year later by Alan\u2019s death from a heart attack. He was 58.   Eulogizing Alan for a New York Times obituary, Mayor Edward Koch \u201948 said the Freedmans had performed \u201cmagnificent service\u201d to the people of New York, leaving behind \u201cmonuments of spirit\u201d to the city. They also left behind both inspiration and challenges for their three daughters just as they were entering adulthood.   \u201cWe had a very, very close family,\u201d says Freedman, \u201cand there was this unwritten thought, amongst all three of us, that the way to honor our parents would be to carry on a legacy of giving that we saw them emulate for us.\u201d   All three sisters have done so amply. Susan Freedman is the current president of the Public Art Fund. Nina Freedman is part of the Global Philanthropy and Employee Engagement team at Bloomberg. Karen Freedman assumed the role of matriarch, keeping the family glued together through years of loss and grief.   \u201cProbably the hardest thing in having something like that happen to you when you\u2019re relatively young\u2014and I was in my early 20s and my youngest sister was just turning 20\u2014is to try and ensure that you don\u2019t go on living the rest of your life in the crash position, fearful and immobilized,\u201d says Freedman. She wills herself instead \u201cto face challenges and take risks and allow my own children to have the confidence, independence, and courage necessary to make a difference in the world.\u201d   Her three children are on their own paths toward public service in art, medicine, and law. Allison Weisberg founded an interactive alternative art space in SoHo, Recess, where artists work while the public may observe and interact. Daniel Weisberg is in an internal medicine residency at Harvard, with a specialty in public health. Liza Weisberg may hew most closely to her mother\u2019s line of work; she completed a two-year trial preparation assistant position at the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office and has just begun her first year at Harvard Law School. \u201cIn the best possible way, she\u2019s given me totally unreasonable expectations about what\u2019s possible as a mother and a professional and a lawyer,\u201d says Weisberg.   But a family joke reveals the extent of her mother\u2019s caution. Departing Cuba at the end of a family vacation during which Allison stayed behind for a college exchange program, the family was battered by a heavy rainstorm. Freedman fretted about leaving Allison.   What could possibly harm her, a family member wondered aloud.   \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Freedman. \u201cShe could get washed into a drainpipe?\u201d   The drainpipe became code for Freedman\u2019s awareness of her overprotective instincts, as in a text she might write to one of her children: \u201cAre you home yet or are you in a drainpipe?   Then again, her protectiveness\u2014of New York City\u2019s foster care children\u2014has been a life force.     THE MOST VULNERABLE   The colorful waiting area on the eighth floor of 110 Lafayette Street features a fanciful mural of an airplane flying through clouds, with the plane\u2019s cockpit windows opening to the real receptionist\u2019s window. A boy and a dog in a rowboat float alongside the plane, and a Lawyers For Children banner flaps in the wind.   The inviting d\u00e9cor underscores the youth-friendly, one-on-one services of the organization\u2014perhaps the Clark Kent side of the operation\u2014while in the offices beyond, Freedman and her staff use legal muscle to challenge wrongdoing on a large scale.   Recently, Freedman turned her attention to the crisis among LGBTQ youth, one of the most preyed-upon subsets of children in foster care. Lawsuits and academic reports chronicle the overrepresentation of LGBTQ youth in care\u2014usually black and Latino\u2014and how they suffer every imaginable abuse almost from the moment they come out to family: homophobic bullying, broken bones, sexual assault.   LFC has long had a project to support individual clients, but in early 2012, Freedman perceived an opportunity to make change on a larger scale. A client served as catalyst. He reported abuse and neglect at his group home, Green Chimneys Gramercy Residence, a nondescript brownstone in the East Village touted as a cutting-edge program for LGBTQ youth. \u201cHe was telling us of inappropriate sexual advances being made by staff members to the young people living there,\u201d Freedman says. \u201cHe told us there was no viable programming, children were routinely locked out of the residence and left on the streets, food was scarce, and staff were clearly without adequate training\u2014bullying, humiliating, and even abusing the young teens in their care.\u201d   She contacted an old friend, Ronald Richter, who, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had been appointed commissioner of the Administration for Children\u2019s Services. Richter was the city\u2019s first openly gay child welfare commissioner, and, coming from a long career as a family court judge, was well acquainted with the miserable plight of LGBTQ youth in foster care. Freedman invited Richter, who is married and has a daughter, to LFC\u2019s offices, where he heard stories from several of Lawyers For Children\u2019s LGBTQ clients. \u201cThey felt incredibly validated, having that kind of access,\u201d Freedman says.   Richter, in turn, was moved. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running a child welfare agency, everything is very, very important,\u201d says Richter, who has since returned, under the new city administration, to his judgeship at Queens Family Court. \u201cAnd there are only certain things that you can act upon with the force of a city agency. Karen made sure that this issue was acted upon with force.   Commissioner Richter himself made a series of unannounced visits to the Gramercy residence, and while he worked with the agency to remedy deficiencies with both the facilities and the services, he finally ended the contract. \u201cWe agreed to disagree about their ability to provide programming,\u201d says Richter, \u201cso there was a parting of ways.\u201d   (Green Chimneys declined to comment on the Gramercy closing.)   Freedman pushed on. She enlisted LFC board member Williams, of counsel at Skadden. They co-signed a demand letter to Richter, outlining specific protections for LGBTQ youth. Williams\u2019s presence in a series of meetings signaled Freedman\u2019s intent to sue if change was not imminent.   Despite her longstanding friendship with Richter, she pressed him, demanding that the city vastly increase the number of safe placements for LGBTQ youth, and that it train and advocate up and down the chain of child welfare services.   \u201cThere\u2019s no winning Karen over,\u201d Richter says. \u201cShe\u2019s never going to decide to favor something because she likes you, or you want her to. She\u2019s true to herself and her core beliefs. Which, of course, can be very annoying. She has a ton of integrity.\u201d   TURNING UP THE HEAT   Freedman\u2019s agenda is never-ending. She has engaged professionals on her firm\u2019s board to teach public speaking and self-presentation to a cadre of rotating \u201cambassadors\u201d from among her 18- to 21-year-old clients. They will advocate on behalf of LFC, spread word of its programs to others, and learn how to best advocate for themselves in the process. And she is determined to take the most cutting-edge research on brain science and apply it to New York City\u2019s child welfare system.   \u201cWe have a system that\u2019s about 30 years behind in terms of good practice,\u201d says Freedman. Many agencies still use confrontational, behavior-modification methods on youths who carry traumas akin to those brought home by war veterans. And when agencies seek arrest warrants for AWOL youths, the result often triggers a negative spiral, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really an abuse of the entire police system,\u201d Freedman adds.   Then there is the matter of the handcuffs. Freedman\u2019s second demand letter elicited silence from the same state court office that awards LFC $5 million annually. Self-preservation might dictate backing down; Freedman, however, stepped up pressure. She tapped the prominent law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, which sent yet one more letter. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of strong-arming them,\u201d Freedman says mildly. \u201cIt will get their attention.\u201d   This summer, the wheels started turning. In a letter, the state court agreed to adopt new rules to remove handcuffs in family court \u201cin a timely manner.\u201d That may not end the practice. But if history serves, Freedman will win this contest. On matters of justice for children, she always does.   As sure as time goes on, the cuffs will come off.   \u2014Candy J.
