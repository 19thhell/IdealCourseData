Daniel Hulsebosch's scholarship ranges from the early modern British empire to the 19th-century US.            William Nelson '65 is a top legal historian who founded the Legal History Colloquium three decades ago.            Barry Friedman's book The Will of the People traces the Supreme Court's relationship with popular opinion.         The study of law and history at NYU Law has deep roots. The Legal History Colloquium is the longest-running legal history workshop in the country, and the Samuel I. Golieb Fellowship Program , which produces leading entry-level academics, is the oldest legal history fellowship program in the United States. The Law School's legal history program also continues to grow and evolve; NYU is one of the few law schools today to offer non-US legal history.   The core law and history faculty include Professors Daniel Hulsebosch, William Nelson '65, and John Phillip Reid.   Nelson pioneered research into early American county court records as sources of legal and social history. His research interests are legal history in colonial America and legal history in New York. His newest book, Fighting for the City , is a history of New York City's legal department. He is also writing a multivolume history of colonial American law. Nelson teaches the Golieb Research Colloquium, the Legal History Colloquium, and the Colloquium on Legal and Constitutional History.   Reid\u2019s research areas include the history of Anglo-American liberty and the legal history of the North American fur trade. His books cover a wide range of subjects. He has written two judicial biographies of 19th-century state judges, two books on the tribal law of the Cherokee nation, and nine books dealing with various legal and constitutional aspects of the American Revolution. Reid teaches the Golieb Research Colloquium and the Colloquium on Legal and Constitutional History.   Hulsebosch specializes in imperial legal history. His scholarship ranges from early modern England to the 19th-century United States. Throughout his work, he explores the relationships among migration, territorial expansion, and the development of legal institutions and doctrines. His 2005 book Constituting Empire: New York and the Transformation of Constitutionalism in the Atlantic World, 1664-1830 examines the intersection of constitutionalism and imperial expansion in the British Empire and early United States by focusing on New York between 1664 and 1830. He is currently researching the development of American legal culture in the two generations after the American Revolution. He teaches American Legal History and the Legal History Colloquium.   Several other faculty have a strong and abiding interest in history, particularly in constitutional tradition. Professors Barry Friedman, David Golove, Helen Hershkoff, Roderick Hills Jr., Deborah Malamud, and Richard Pildes draw on a historical perspective to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the evolution of the law. And law students can take up to 10 credits from NYU\u2019s history department and study with professors such as Lauren Benton and Jane Burbank, who specialize in legal history. Students may pursue a joint JD/PhD , conditional on being admitted to each program independently.   At the heart of the Legal History Program is the Legal History Colloquium . Taught by Hulsebosch, Nelson, and Reid, its mission is unique : the training of young scholars rather than the testing of ideas of senior professors. The core of the Legal History Colloquium consists of the Samuel I. Golieb Fellows, a group of two or three graduate students chosen each year from schools around the United States who attend the Legal History Colloquium each week and present their own work in the colloquium. Other participants have included JD students and graduate students at NYU, Fulbright Scholars from Europe, and faculty from the Law School and other law schools in the metropolitan region.

Restoration  and Early 18th-Century Literature    ENGL-UA  500 Prerequisite:  British Literature II (ENGL-UA 220). Offered periodically. 4 points.    The Restoration and the eighteenth century brought vast changes to the island of Great Britain, which became a single nation after 1707, when the Act of Union joined Scotland to England and Wales. In 1660, the theatres reopened after nearly two decades of Puritan rule and prohibition, and the publishing trades boomed as never before. This period saw the birth of new literary genres that are still popular today (the novel and journalism, for instance) and the continuity and transformation of revered older genres (epic poetry, for instance, or its modern counterpart, mock epic). It saw one of the greatest periods of satire in English literary history, the emergence of professional women writers and the rise of proto-feminist writing, and much more. We will consider a wide range of genres such as novels, newspapers and periodicals, drama, essays, and satire, and authors such as Aphra Behn, John Dryden, Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe, and Eliza Haywood.          Colloquium:  Mid- and Late 18th-Century British Literature    ENGL-UA  501 Prerequisite:  British Literature II (ENGL-UA 220). Offered periodically. 4 points.    The eighteenth century brought vast changes to the island of Great Britain, which became a single nation after 1707, when the Act of Union joined Scotland to England and Wales. It saw the explosion of the nation's major cities (especially London) and the entrenchment of Britain as a colonial power in Canada, India, and elsewhere (as well as the loss of the American colonies in 1776). The age of Enlightenment saw new scientific theories and discoveries, extensive overseas exploration, and almost ceaseless challenges to diverse forms of authority (political, religious, cultural, and so on). It saw the development of the literary marketplace and Grub Street and the rise of new genres that are still popular today (the novel and journalism, for instance), as well as the emergence of professional women writers and the rise of proto-feminist writing. We will explore genres such as fiction, drama, poetry, satire, essays, travel writing, and biography, and authors such as Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, Thomas Gray, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Ann Radcliffe, Francis Burney, and Jane Austen.

Daniel Hulsebosch's scholarship ranges from the early modern British empire to the 19th-century US.            William Nelson '65 is a top legal historian who founded the Legal History Colloquium three decades ago.            Barry Friedman's book The Will of the People traces the Supreme Court's relationship with popular opinion.         The study of law and history at NYU Law has deep roots. The Legal History Colloquium is the longest-running legal history workshop in the country, and the Samuel I. Golieb Fellowship Program , which produces leading entry-level academics, is the oldest legal history fellowship program in the United States. The Law School's legal history program also continues to grow and evolve; NYU is one of the few law schools today to offer non-US legal history.   The core law and history faculty include Professors Daniel Hulsebosch, William Nelson '65, and John Phillip Reid.   Nelson pioneered research into early American county court records as sources of legal and social history. His research interests are legal history in colonial America and legal history in New York. His newest book, Fighting for the City , is a history of New York City's legal department. He is also writing a multivolume history of colonial American law. Nelson teaches the Golieb Research Colloquium, the Legal History Colloquium, and the Colloquium on Legal and Constitutional History.   Reid\u2019s research areas include the history of Anglo-American liberty and the legal history of the North American fur trade. His books cover a wide range of subjects. He has written two judicial biographies of 19th-century state judges, two books on the tribal law of the Cherokee nation, and nine books dealing with various legal and constitutional aspects of the American Revolution. Reid teaches the Golieb Research Colloquium and the Colloquium on Legal and Constitutional History.   Hulsebosch specializes in imperial legal history. His scholarship ranges from early modern England to the 19th-century United States. Throughout his work, he explores the relationships among migration, territorial expansion, and the development of legal institutions and doctrines. His 2005 book Constituting Empire: New York and the Transformation of Constitutionalism in the Atlantic World, 1664-1830 examines the intersection of constitutionalism and imperial expansion in the British Empire and early United States by focusing on New York between 1664 and 1830. He is currently researching the development of American legal culture in the two generations after the American Revolution. He teaches American Legal History and the Legal History Colloquium.   Several other faculty have a strong and abiding interest in history, particularly in constitutional tradition. Professors Barry Friedman, David Golove, Helen Hershkoff, Roderick Hills Jr., Deborah Malamud, and Richard Pildes draw on a historical perspective to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the evolution of the law. And law students can take up to 10 credits from NYU\u2019s history department and study with professors such as Lauren Benton and Jane Burbank, who specialize in legal history. Students may pursue a joint JD/PhD , conditional on being admitted to each program independently.   At the heart of the Legal History Program is the Legal History Colloquium . Taught by Hulsebosch, Nelson, and Reid, its mission is unique : the training of young scholars rather than the testing of ideas of senior professors. The core of the Legal History Colloquium consists of the Samuel I. Golieb Fellows, a group of two or three graduate students chosen each year from schools around the United States who attend the Legal History Colloquium each week and present their own work in the colloquium. Other participants have included JD students and graduate students at NYU, Fulbright Scholars from Europe, and faculty from the Law School and other law schools in the metropolitan region.

Golieb Fellowship           The Samuel I. Golieb Fellowship in Legal History was established in 1981 to provide young legal historians with research support and a forum to present their work. The stipend is currently $20,000, with the possibility of an additional housing stipend for Fellows who live in New York City. Dozens of Golieb alumni are members of law school faculties and history departments across the country.

Syllabus : [ Stevens F07 ][ Stevens F08 ] [ Acikgoz S13 ]          POL-UA 810 - Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. In this course, the tools of economic theory, game theory, and social-choice theory will be applied to the rational-choice analysis of political, economic, and social institutions, whose consequences for society will be derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. The product of such analysis, which is reflected in the title of this course, is normative: To design institutions that meet certain \u201cengineering\u201d specifications and, therefore, may be superior to institutions that, because they arose more haphazardly, may not satisfy these specifications. Like engineering in the natural sciences, which translates theory (e.g., from physics) into practical design (e.g., a bridge), engineering in the social sciences translates rational-choice analysis into the design of better political-economic-social institutions.    Syllabus : [ Brams S05 ] [ Brams S11 ]          POL-UA 812- Introduction to Political Psychology This course offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. The course introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics.    Syllabus: [ Dickson F08 ]          POL-UA 840 -- Introduction to Game Theory This course introduces the basic concepts of elementary game theory in a way that allows you to use them in solving simple problems. And second, it gives a flavor of how game theory can be used in the study of political science by presenting a wide array of example applications. In addition, throughout the course we will discuss evidence from experiments and from other sources that bears on when we should expect game theory to be most useful in applied studies, and when we might reasonably have doubts about the types of predictions that it makes about human behavior. Syllabus : [ Hafer F14 ]       POL-UA 842 -- Doing Political Economy    Political economy has made great strides in recent year in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this class is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. First students are introduced to the tools of modern political economy. In a relatively non-mathematical manner students will also learn the conceptual basis of statistical testing. These tools are then applied to policy problems in three substantive areas: international relations, American politics and comparative politics. Through these methods and their application students will learn how to evaluate public policy using theory and evidence. Syllabus : [ Smith F10 ]          POL-UA 844 - Games, Strategy, and Politics Theories of political strategy, with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and negotiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strategies and uses of power, with some applications outside political science.    Syllabus : [ Brams F13 ]          POL-UA 845 - Social Choice and Politics Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals'politics.ug.coursedescriptions voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions.

Syllabus - [ Browne F12 ]                     Political Theory           POL-UA 100 - Political Theory (Core Course) This course is an introduction to the history of political theory. We will study many of the great texts of the Western tradition. These texts raise important questions about the nature of individual rights, the roots of government authority, the circumstances of legitimate revolution, the justification of religious tolerance, and the meaning of political ideals such as liberty, equality, and justice. Despite the age of some of the texts with which we will wrestle, the purpose of the course is not exclusively historical. Instead, part of the reason that these texts are widely seen as classics is because they continue to shape, inform, and challenge the analysis of current political phenomena. It is through the categories created and clarified by these thinkers that we conceptualize, understand, and assess our political lives. Syllabus : [ Kates Sum10 ] [ Pevnick S11 ]          POL-UA 110 - Topics in Premodern Political Philosophy Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Intensive introduction to the major themes of Western political thought through a careful analysis of classical and medieval works. Among the authors studied are Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, and St. Thomas Aquinas. Formerly Political Thought from Plato to Machiavelli.          POL-UA 120 - Modern Political Thought: 1500 to the Present Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche.          POL-UA 120 - Nietzsche and the 20th Century In Germany in the twentieth century, Nietzsche was revered by Zionists, anti-Semites, German nationalists, cosmopolitans, conservatives, anarchists, royalists, atheists and the religious. Who was this figure who managed to inspire such contradictory adherents?   We begin by examining Nietzsche\u2019s work so that we can come to some understanding of who he was. Then we look at how, and why, he influenced so many of the major thinkers of the twentieth century. The course is designed to offer students a new way to think about modernity, modern political thought, and the century from which we have just escaped. Classes will be devoted to detailed discussions of the readings.  Syllabus: [ O'Brien ]           POL-UA 130 -- Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy This course will provide students the ability systematically to evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts from normative political theory. We consider four overarching questions: Should public officials be responsible to universal laws of morality? By what criteria do we evaluate the ends of public policy? Are the intentions and internal psychological state of the public official morally relevant? How do we evaluate moral choices when outcomes depend on the decisions of more than one individual? In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to \"do bad in order to do good?\" In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Topics for this semester include the decision to drop the atomic bomb in World War II, the treatment of terrorist suspects, lying in office, racial profiling, the analysis of environmental policy, health care allocation, social welfare policy, capital punishment, international intervention in humanitarian crises, and collective responsibility in office.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S05 ]         POL-UA 138- Theories of Justice Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 This course is an undergraduate-level introduction to the subject of justice in contemporary Anglo-American political theory. Its aim is to provide students with an understanding of the current state of the theoretical literature on justice as well as to enable them to engage in their own critical thinking about the topic. For the most part, discussion proceeds in chronological order. We begin with the study of utilitarianism\u2014the dominant approach to political philosophy in the modern era. From there we proceed to a thorough treatment of the political philosopher who has, arguably, dominated the contemporary scene: John Rawls. In particular, we shall examine the arguments put forward in A Theory of Justice for what he calls \u201cjustice as fairness\u201d\u2014a conception of justice that he believed to be superior to that articulated by utilitarians. But in developing his own distinctively contractarian conception of justice, Rawls was, however, subject to much criticism. For that reason, we turn next to a variety of alternative conceptions of justice put forward in direct contrast to his position: namely, libertarianism, luck egalitarianism and the capabilities approach, Marxism, communitarianism, and, finally, feminism.    In the latter half of the course we focus on a number of related problems that have been at issue in contemporary discussions of justice. More specifically, we explore the question of whether principles of justice apply solely within the boundaries of particular states or whether their application is global in scope instead. Next, we consider whether principles of justice fix our relations with our contemporaries alone or whether they further constrain our actions towards future generations as well. In a related manner, we also ask how, if at all, justice constrains our relations with non-human animals. We end, finally, by considering whether justice and democracy conflict, and, if so, which ought to receive priority in practical political action.    Syllabus : [ Kates S11 ]          POL-UA 140 - Socialist Theory Concentrates on those socialist schools-Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism-that have proved to be the most successful. Aims to present their major theories and to examine the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live.    Syllabus : [ Ollman F07 ] [ Ollman F10 ]          POL-UA 150 - Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 This course will focus on ways to understand nationalism and ethnic identification and the conflict that they sometimes stimulate. Readings will be from varied perspectives. This course is a discussion seminar.    Syllabus : [ Hardin S07 ]           POL-UA 160 - Democracy and Dictatorship Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship.    Syllabus : [ Erbal Sum07 ]          POL-UA 170 - American Political Thought 4 points -- Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present. Topics include Puritanism, revolution and independence, the Constitution framing, Hamiltonian nationalism, Jeffersonian republicanism, Jacksonian democracy, pro- and antislavery thought, Civil War and Reconstruction, Social Darwinism and laissez-faire, the reformist thought of populism, progressivism and socialism, legal realism, the New Deal and 20th-century liberalism, modern conservatism, civil rights, and war protest. Readings and discussion are based on original and interpretative sources.          POL-UA 195 - Undergraduate Field Seminar: Political Theory Prerequisite: POL-UA 100 Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in political theory. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.    Syllabus : Constitution-Making [ Pasquino F07 ]    Justice [ Hardin S07 ]    Dialectical Methodology [ Ollman S07 ]    Contemporary Democratic Theory [ Pevnick F09 ], [ Pevnick F10 ][ Pevnick S13 ]    Theories of Justice [ Pevnick S10 ][ Pevnick S13 ]          POL-UA 994 - Law and Courts    The general topic of the lectures will be the role of the judicial power in constitutional democracies. Notwithstanding the well know increasing role of courts in our societies political theory doesn't pay enough attention to the judicial power in the institutional structure of the separation of powers. The course will start from considering and analyzing the classical doctrine of the separation of powers (Locke, Montesquieu, J. Madison, A. Hamilton, the anti-federalist Brutus, A. Bergasse) in order to identify the limits of it concerning the role assigned to the judiciary. We will moreover consider the general theory if the judicial institutions from Aristotle to Coke, Hobbes and to the contemporary debates (the Scandinavian School, M. Shapiro, P. Stein).The last section of the course will be devoted to Supreme/Constitutional Courts and to the new balance of powers in the contemporary world.    Syllabus :           POL-UA 994 - The Constitution in the Age of Terror Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course will examine in depth the legal, moral, social and political context for counter-terrorism. It will attempt to frame issues of strategy and policy within the moral tradition of just war doctrine and the constitutional values embraced by the Supreme Court of the United States and the international courts in the Nuremberg tradition. We will read widely in journalism, philosophy, policy and law, with a number of classes devoted to court decisions.    Syllabus : [ Gerety S07 ]          POL-UA 994 - Law and Morality in the Age of Terror Prerequisite: POL-UA 100   This course seeks to deepen our understanding of the law and policy of counter-terrorism by approaching the challenges of terrorist attacks from several points of view. Notably, we will deploy moral philosophy, international and domestic law, social science--and of course policy studies , including arguments over institutional arrangements. Over the semester we will examine a variety of cases and hypotheses, touching on such matters as interrogation and torture, killing and assassination, detention and trial.  If the student has taken a course in AD that has been approved as equivalent to the POL-UA 100, can we issue a permission code, or would you prefer to do so.    Syllabus : [ Gerety S11 ]          POL-UA 994 - Religion and Politics Our focus in this course will be on the relationship between Christianity and liberal democracy in the modern era. In part one, we will read texts from the modern liberal canon with the intention of understanding the differing modes of engagement with religion, we will see that this has entailed neutrality, rejection, or an embrace whether warm or stifling. None of these approaches have been wholly successful, or a complete failure. In part two, we look at Nietzsche\u2019s claim that God is \u201cdead\u201d and see how this claim has been used, and abused, by subsequent thinkers. Overall, the course will offer students a new way to think about the evolving relationship between religion and politics and the ways in which it shapes our lives..    Syllabus : [ O'Brien S11 ]                     American Politics           POL-UA 300 - Power and Politics in America (Core Course)    Offered every semester. 4 points. A survey of national political institutions and behavior in the United States, which introduces students to a variety of analytic concepts and approaches useful for the study of domestic politics. Concepts typically covered include public goods and collective action; preference aggregation and the median voter theorem; delegation, presentation, and accountability; agenda control; inter-branch bargaining; and the mechanisms of private influence on public policy.    Syllabus : [ Gordon F07 ] [ Harvey F10 ] [ Egan S09 ] [ Egan S11 ] [ Egan F12 ] [ Nagler S13 ]          POL-UA 306 - Public Policy Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Introduction to public policymaking in American federal government. The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. Looks at the operations of the government in the terms Washingtonians use. Examines the roles of Congress and the bureaucracy; the procedures of budgeting and regulatory agencies; and the issues in several concrete areas of policy, mainly in the domestic area. Excellent preparation for students planning to take the Washington Semester Program.    Syllabus : [ Mead F07 ]           POL-UA 310 - The Presidency Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Study of the American presidency, its origins and roles, including those of commander in chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice. The president is also viewed as a decision maker and compared with the heads of other governments. Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies.    Syllabus : [ Kim S07 ]          POL-UA 311 - The Biology of Politics    Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? Why do individuals have the political attitudes they do? These questions are central to the study of politics. Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, mobilization, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. However, scholars have recently begun to explore the possibility that biological differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political attitudes and behavior. This course explores the relationship between biology and political behavior with an emphasis on how the two may be linked.    Syllabus : [ Dawes S12 ] [ Dawes S13 ]          POL-UA 315 - Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence This course is about using logic to think about issues of public policy and evidence to do the same thing. One way to think about this course is it is sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, and in Moneyball) applied to vastly more important topics than baseball: making schools better, designing health policy and dealing with climate change (with tons of other policy applications possible, but we will focus on these three).    Syllabus: [ Beck S13 ]          POL-UA 320 - Congress and Legislative Assemblies Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States. Although some attention is given to state legislatures and municipal lawmaking bodies, the major emphasis is on the Congress. Readings include a textbook, official sources such as the Congressional Record and Congressional District Data Book, and the new behavioral studies and commentaries.          POL-UA 330 - The American Constitution This course examines the major contours of the American Constitution excluding the Bill of Rights. We will discuss constitutional law in the broader framework of social and political philosophy and explore evolution of judicial doctrine through our constitutional history. The two major themes that run through most of the cases are federalism and separation of powers.    Syllabus : [Kawar F07] [ Rajsingh S07 ] [ Harrington F06 ] [ Rajsingh S11 ]          POL-UA 332 - Civil Liberties Interpretation of the Bill of Rights, the Civil War Amendments, and other rights in the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Topics include freedom of speech and press; free exercise of religion and separation of church and state; the right of privacy; rights of the criminally accused; equal protection of the law against race, gender, and other discrimination; and the rights of franchise and citizenship. Cases are read and discussed closely for their legal and philosophical content.    Syllabus : [ Rajsingh S06 ] [ Khan F08 ] [ Harrington S13 ]          POL-UA 333 - The United States Supreme Court Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course provides an introduction to current research on Supreme Court decision making. Specifically, the primary focus of the course is on why the Justices decide cases in the way that they do. However, we will also look at the Justices\ufffd decisions on writs of certiorari, and at the process by which the Justices are nominated and confirmed to the Court.    Syllabus : [ Harvey S07 ]          POL-UA 334 - American Law and Legal System Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Introduction to law and the legal system through the reading of actual cases. Topics include the adjudication of conflict, the structure and functions of trial and appellate courts, civil and criminal procedure, judicial remedies, judicial decision making, and the limits of judicial relief. Uses tort, contract, property, divorce, and other law for illustration.          POL-UA 335 - Law and Society Identical to V62.0001 and V18.0722 This course studies the relationship between law and society by studying the nature of \u201crights\u201d and \u201crights claims.\u201d The topics will address many issues and debates, but we will focus particularly on several main questions. What are the different theoretical bases for rights claims? How does the law impact what rights individuals and groups in civil society fight for, and the way they frame their claims? What happens when different rights claims conflict with one another? What is the difference between a right and a policy preference, and how do those different classifications affect discourse and public policy?    Syllabus : [ Harrington F10 ] [ Ferri S11 ]          POL-UA 336 - Gender in Law    Identical to V18.0723 Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, also addresses to what extent understandings of the gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. Syllabus : [ Harrington S10 ]          POL-UA 337 - The Rule of Law    The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology. This seminar explores the theory surrounding the rule of law ideal. It focuses on the political conditions that promote the rule of law as well as on the challenges to the rule of law in time of emergencies. Topics include the connection between law and morality, the political foundation of the rule of law, the interaction among political institutions in promoting or subverting the rule of law, the rule of law in times of crisis, the eects of emergency powers on the rule of law, and the rule of law and terrorism prevention. Syllabus : [ Dragu S13 ]          POL-UA 340 - Political Parties Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Background, structure, operation, and definition of the party systems. Development of the two-party system in the United States from its origins to the present. Formal organization of parties on the national and state levels and control of the parties within the state. Party politics in the South, political machines, ethnic politics, nominations for public office, and pressure groups on the party system. The national election from first stirrings of potential candidates through the general election.          POL-UA 342 - American Public Opinion Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 What do Americans think about politics? Why do they hold these beliefs? And does it matter? This course grapples with these three questions, which lie at the core of our understanding of the health of American democratic society. In doing so, the class will give students the tools they need to critically assess the construction, conduct, and reporting of public opinion surveys.    Syllabus : [ Egan F07 ] [ Egan F08 ] [ Egan F10 ] [ Egan S13 ]          POL-UA 344 The Election Process Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Provides an understanding of election processes in the United States through different theoretical approaches to the study of campaigns and elections and the testing of empirical hypotheses. Analyzes campaign strategies of political candidates, the use of polls and media in campaigns, and the effects of issues and personalities on election outcomes. Evaluates the role of presidential primaries and elections in the functioning of a democracy.    Syllabus : [ Morton F06 ] [ Nagler S10 ]          POL-UA 350 - Bureaucracy and Public Policy Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. In this course, we will examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we will draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas.

Syllabus : [Turem F07] [ Harrington S06 ] [ Harrington F10 ]          POL-UA 360 - Urban Government and Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Identical to V99.0371 Study of politics and politicians in the contemporary American city. Evolution of local party organizations, the rise and fate of party \"bosses,\" and the predicament of the ordinary citizen in the urban community. Patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community. Conceptions of effective leadership in urban politics and the role of the police, the press, and \"good government\" groups in local political life.          POL-UA 380 Minority Representation in American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 This course is an exploration of whether and how racial and ethnic minorities are able to organize effectively and press their demands through the American political system. Specifically, we will focus on the political behavior of minority citizens, the relative strength and effect of these groups at the polls and in political office, the theory and practice of group formation as it applies to minority groups, the responsiveness of elected officials, and the legal and constitutional obstacles and instruments that provide context and shape these phenomena. As this course is also part of the Alexander Hamilton Center for Political Economy we focus primarily on how different public policies can be used to enhance or reduce minority representation in American politics. We examine how public policies can affect both descriptive and substantive representation.    Syllabus : [ Morton F06 ] [ Morton S08 ]          POL-UA 382 - The Politics of Poverty and Welfare Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Poverty and welfare problems in the United States and the controversies aroused by them.

Syllabus : [ Mead S10 ]          POL-UA 385 - Political Economy: The United States in Comparative Perspective Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 or POL-UA 500 This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including the politics of economic reform, party systems and voting, theories of ethnic politics, and social capital.    Students in the Alexander Hamilton Institute honors sections will also focus on how the lessons of rigorous political science can be used to inform public policy decisions.    Syllabus : [ Tucker S09 ]          POL-UA 395 - Undergraduate Field Seminar: American Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in American politics. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each semester.    Syllabus : Congressional Elections [ Nagler F13 ]    The Politics of Judicial Decision Making [ Harvey S07 ]    Minority Representation in American Politics [ Morton S07 ]    Welfare Politics [ Mead S05 ]       Spring 2011 Seminars:    Interest Groups We will be examining the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the difficulty of demonstrating influence empirically despite the \"you know it when you see it\" flavor of contemporary journalistic accounts.    Congressional Elections and Competitiveness    A prominent fact of congressional elections in the United States is the frequency with which they are won by incumbents. The lack of competition in these elections will be the focus of this course. To understand this lack of competition we will cover considerable ground: the basic facts of re-election rates, the amount of money spent by incumbents and challengers, and the nature of congressional districts. We will also cover existing theories and evidence about the behavior of voters that maintains so many incumbents in o ce: including the impact of issues, the impact of campaign spending, and whether or not voters have become more polarized. We will also look at the extent to which congressional elections are decided by national forces versus conditions peculiar to the individual race (see 1994, 2006, 2010). In trying to understand why congressional elections have become so uncompetitive we will look at possible reforms to increase competitiveness. We will also consider the impact of the behavior of the major parties on the competitiveness of elections, and examine how changes in party strategies could lead to more competitive elections. Syllabus: [ Nagler S11 ]          POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Politics and Finance Prerequisites: POL-UA 300, three other politics courses, Junior or Senior standing, 3.5 GPA and one course in Economics. This seminar examines how legislation and regulation influences the structure of financial markets and how players in these markets intervene in the political process to create or modify legislative and regulatory outcomes. Particular emphasis will be placed on the United States. International comparisons will also be present. The class will assume that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory will be provided. The approach will be similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions will be made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.    Syllabus : [ Rosenthal F10 ] [ Rosenthal F11 ]        POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Politics and Courts    Prerequisites: POL-UA 300 and three other politics courses, 3.5 GPA This seminar will examine the question of judicial independence. Our two primary questions are: Are federal courts in the United States independent of the elected branches? Should they be? We will read secondary and primary sources, the latter including both judicial opinions and quantitative data, and talk about how one might answer these questions. We will also look at state courts, and at how courts function in other countries. Students will write brief weekly responses to the readings, as well as develop a research paper on the question of judicial independence.    Syllabus : [ Harvey S11 ]          POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Slavery, Inequality, and the Constitution    This seminar will explore recent work on the growth and causes of income inequality in the United States. We will particularly focus on the role of political institutions in contributing to or lessening income inequality. We will also examine the choices made in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and consider the consequences of those choices for the later growth of income inequality in the United States. Finally, we will read recent work on the effects of colonial-era inequality, including the institution of slavery, on later constitutional choices. We will read secondary work, both qualitative and quantitative, and explore currently available datasets. Students will write weekly response papers and will complete a final research paper.   POL-UA 396 Honors Seminar: Political Economy of Inequality    Over the past four decades, the United States has experienced dramatic increases in economic inequality, political polarization, and the percentage of the population that is foreign born. It has experienced a dramatic decrease in market regulation, especially financial markets. The seminar will investigate how these major changes in American society tie together. We will seek to understand why the increase in inequality has not been counterbalanced by a political process that would lead to more taxation and more redistribution. In particular, we will ask why, after the financial crisis of 2007-08 was ruinous for millions of Americans, Congress moved sharply to the right with the rise of the Tea Party and the Republican success in the midterm elections of 2010. Syllabus: [ Rosenthal F13 ]  POL-UA 341: Private Influence in Public Policy    In this course, we will examine the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, and the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the overcoming the challenges associated with demonstrating influence empirically.    Syllabus : [ Gordon S13 ]                    Comparative Politics           POL-UA 500 - Comparative Politics (Core Course) We study politics in a comparative context, not as a form of intellectual tourism, but to broaden and deepen our understanding of important and general political processes. We do this by making systematic comparisons between political systems that are similar in many respects, but nonetheless differ in important ways. This allows us to analyze the effect of these differences in a careful and rigorous way, enriching our understanding of how politics works. The philosophy of this course is thus to concentrate on a group of developed countries that are similar in many important ways, seeking to analyze core features of representative democracy by making systematic comparisons between countries. (Other courses in comparative politics offered by the department focus more on developing countries.)    Syllabus : [ Tucker F10 ] [ Laver S06 ] [ Laver S10 ] [ Tucker F11 ]          POL-UA 505 Elections and Voting Prerequisite: POL-UA 300 or POL-UA 500 Perhaps no other political activity is as important for public policy in democratic (and even quasi-democratic) countries as voting and elections, which determine who the ultimate policy makers will be. Thus if we ever hope to understand why governments produce the policies they do, we have to begin by asking why people vote the way they do. Why do certain parties and candidates lose elections, while others win? How important is the economy in influencing election results? And why do some people choose not to vote at all? As democracy in its various forms spreads across the globe, more and more people are voting. In response, this course studies elections and voting as a truly international phenomenon. Topics closely related to voting and elections - such as political parties, electoral rules and systems, and partisan identification - are explored as well. Students will also use to learn political science methods based on logic and evidence to explore competing explanations for these and other questions.    Syllabus : [ Tucker S07 ]          POL-UA 510 - Western European Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Identical to V42.0510 Study of the politics of Britain, Ireland, France, and the German Federal Republic.

Syllabus : [Schain F07] [ Rama S04 ] [ Schain F10 ]          POL-UA 511 Immigration and Politics in Western Europe Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 In this course we will explore immigration and patterns of immigrant incorporation in Western Europe in comparative perspective (mostly with the United States). Since the early 1960s immigration has transformed European countries into multi-racial and multi-ethnic societies. We will first explore how public policy contributed to this transformation, how it was structured by different concepts, traditions and laws on citizenship, and how it was related to transformation of the party system and the emergence of the extreme right and \u201cidentity politics\u201d in Western Europe.    Syllabus : [ Schain S07 ]          POL-UA 512 - Italian Politics Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective.

POL-UA 530 - Politics of Latin America This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development. Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world? Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada? Why did so many countries fell to dictatorship in the 20th Century? Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order? How does democracy perform in Latin America? Why have some Latin American countries performed better than others? What are the challenges for Latin America into the future? The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. The course will focus on institutional theories, but we will also discuss alternative theories. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism, amongst others. In doing so, we will study differences as well as commonalities across different Latin American countries.    Syllabus : [ C.

Syllabus : [ Zubida F05 ]          POL-UA 584 - Contemporary African Politics This course offers an introduction to contemporary African politics. Our goal is to introduce students to the most pressing problems African countries have faced since independence. Questions motivating the course include: (1) Why state institutions weaker in African than in other developing regions? (2) What explains Africa's slow economic growth? (3) What can be done to improve political accountability on the continent? (4) Why have some African countries been plagued by high levels of political violence while others have not? (5) Can or should the West attempt to \"save\" Africa?    The course is structured in three parts. In the first, we will review Africa's recent political history, concentrating on the impacts of colonialism, and the types of states created in the wake of African independence movements. Then we turn to the challenges post-colonial governments face as they attempt to manage the interests of ethnically diverse societies, and reform their economies and political institutions. We end the course with an in-depth look at patterns of violent conflict across Africa, and the daunting tasks that many African countries face as they attempt to recover from conflict.    Syllabus : [ Scacco S11]          POL-UA 994- Political and Bureaucratic Corruption Prerequisite: POL-UA 500 Political and bureaucratic corruption affects the quality of public policy, and indirectly the well-being of millions of people. Empirical evidence shows that corruption slows economic development, biases government expenditures, and reinforces income inequality. What do political science and economics know about the phenomenon? This course surveys the recent literature on the political economy of corruption. Theoretical and empirical perspectives are introduced. Corruption can be understood as the collusion between special interests and politicians, against citizens. Possible causes (cultural traditions, the design of political institutions, the distribution of resources in a society) and motives (e.g., private greed, the need to finance political parties) are explored. Some attention is also paid to the possible solutions: transparency, electoral accountability, a free media market, independent prosecutors, and better pay for public servants.

Syllabus : Ethnic Identity Politics and Democracy [ Chandra F07 ]       POL-UA 597 - Networks and Politics Are segregated neighborhoods always the result of discrimination? If a revolution is brewing, how many people must the revolutionaries personally recruit in order to incite widespread revolution? How debilitating will a snowed-in JFK Airport be to national air travel? Why are all actors separated from Kevin Bacon by 6 degrees or fewer? Why did Blu-Ray dominate HD DVD? The budding new field of Network Analysis offers the tools to answer questions like these. Network analysis is a recent import into the social sciences, and has been developed in a diverse set of fields, from physics to computer science to sociology. Recognizing that objects of study (people, genes, web pages, virus hosts, etc.) are often influenced by \u2018neighboring\u2019 objects of study, these fields have created a paradigm and a set of tools that political scientists can use to study segregation, the spread of ideas, learning, institutional design, the adoption of new technologies, epidemics, migration, trade, revolutions, and various other phenomena that involve a group of people interacting. The blend of networks and political science covered in this course will reveal a wealth of untapped research opportunities and chances to make real contributions to the field of political science. This course assumes no background in social network analysis; we will begin with the basics. By the end of the course, you will have the skills necessary to explain or make predictionsabout real world political phenomena using network techniques. You will also develop the invaluable skill of extracting meaning from academic articles that assume a level oftechnical proficiency above your own\u2014a skill that will serve you well in academia, the world of consulting, and beyond.

POL-UA 994 - Causes and Consequences of Globalization \"Globalization\" is a conceptual stand-in for highly complex, interdependent interactions between economies, polities, cultures, and almost all other national-level social constructs. Globalization has accrued a mass of de nitions and interpretations which cannot be reconciled easily (if at all) with one another as a result of its multifaceted nature. We will consequently focus on only two of globalization's faces\" in this course: economic and political globalization. After wrestling the with de ning and understanding the concept globalization, the course will be divided into two parts. The rst part of the course focuses on understanding and analyzing the causes and e ects of economic globalization, i.e. the increased interconnectedness of national and regional economies via lowered trade barriers, intensfi ed nancial ows, and increased labor mobility. We consider previous eras of globalization and theories of economic growth that inform arguments for increased globalization, focusing on the economics of neo-instutionalism. We spend a week each on trade liberalization, capital ows, and the role of multinational corporations in the international economy. We end the rst part of the course with a discussion of the domestic sects of globalization. The second part of the course turns to the globalization of political ideas as well as the s ects of the globalized economy on political outcomes. Again, we revisit the past and consider the role of economic growth and the dissemination of ideas in understanding political order. We cover both regime transitions nd stability in the face of economic shocks. We then analyze the role of national political competition in furthering or abating globalization. We then turn towards the e ects of an older era of globalization|the colonial period|onmore current political phenomena. We nish the course with the consequences of democracy promotion in the developing world.

Syllabus: [ Mead S08 ] [ Mead S10 ] [ Mead S11 ] [ Mead S12 ]          POL-UA 720 - Diplomacy and Negotiation Prerequisite: POL-UA 700 Analyzes the theory and practice of diplomacy, with special emphasis on bargaining strategies that nations use to try to settle their differences and avoid wars, including the use of mediators, arbitrators, and institutions like the United Nations. Applies game theory to analyze the use of exaggeration, threats, and deception in bilateral and multilateral diplomacy. Supplements case studies of international negotiation, especially in crises, with studies of domestic bargaining used in the formulation of foreign policy.       POL-UA 725 - The Political Economy of Development    Prerequisite: POL-UA 700 This course will examine the inter-relationship between politics and economic development. It will address both how socio-political factors influence economic outcomes, and how economic factors, in turn, shape political outcomes. We will begin by exploring the legacy of historical institutions such as slavery and colonialism on development and growth.
