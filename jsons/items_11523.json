Understanding this reality is one of the many factors that shape our approach to public service education at NYU Wagner. We know that race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, disability status and many other aspects of personal identity shape the way we see the world, the way resources are distributed, the way policies are made, the way boundaries are drawn and the way institutions are managed.   NYU Wagner is not unique among academic institutions in acknowledging that differences matter. But we claim some distinction in how we approach these issues. In addition to robust efforts to attract and engage a student body diverse across multiple dimensions, we begin with an explicit focus on diversity at our new student retreat. Many Wagner courses explore issues of discrimination and access, disparity and equality, and exclusion and inclusion. We continue to develop workshops and gatherings focused on building our collective capacity to work across boundaries of difference and to promote social justice. We support both identity- and issue-based student groups, and the research of our faculty consistently addresses issues of inequity and disparity.   We also recognize that our work around diversity will always be a work in progress. And as a graduate school devoted to preparing the future leaders of institutions and organizations \u2013 for whom a diverse world is a given \u2013 we continue to reflect on our own practices in an effort to live up to our aspirations.

Understanding this reality is one of the many factors that shape our approach to public service education at NYU Wagner. We know that race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, disability status and many other aspects of personal identity shape the way we see the world, the way resources are distributed, the way policies are made, the way boundaries are drawn and the way institutions are managed.   NYU Wagner is not unique among academic institutions in acknowledging that differences matter. But we claim some distinction in how we approach these issues. In addition to robust efforts to attract and engage a student body diverse across multiple dimensions, we begin with an explicit focus on diversity at our new student retreat. Many Wagner courses explore issues of discrimination and access, disparity and equality, and exclusion and inclusion. We continue to develop workshops and gatherings focused on building our collective capacity to work across boundaries of difference and to promote social justice. We support both identity- and issue-based student groups, and the research of our faculty consistently addresses issues of inequity and disparity.   We also recognize that our work around diversity will always be a work in progress. And as a graduate school devoted to preparing the future leaders of institutions and organizations \u2013 for whom a diverse world is a given \u2013 we continue to reflect on our own practices in an effort to live up to our aspirations.   We invite you to join us in this effort.

Commission activities support critical inquiry into hierarchies of power affecting the interweaving social locations of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, age, ability, culture, nationality, religion, and related areas. In this spirit, the commission seeks to promote inter-change among faculty concerned with social justice and to work toward the following goals.  To create arenas in which to address issues pertaining to gender, race, and social justice  and, in particular, to encourage the professions represented in the Steinhardt School of Education  to become more responsive to these issues.  To foster and integrate feminist and other critical scholarship that focuses on hierarchies  of privilege as they affect individuals and groups in diverse social locations.  To encourage teaching that addresses social justice issues in the various disciplines and professions,  as these issues impact on both individuals and communities.  To provide a supportive and collegial context for faculty interested in issues of gender, race,  and social justice within the school, the University, and the broader community.
