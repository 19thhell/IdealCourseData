Case Study and Ethnographic Inquiry Bryfman. 3 credits Wednesdays, 4:55 &ndash; 7:35 p.m. This course further prepares students to use a variety of qualitative methods in their ongoing research. It explores theories underlying ethnographic methods and focuses on developing skills in conducting ethnographic research, observation, interviewing skills, and focus groups. The course will also consider ethnographic research in a digital age, looking at qualitative research as it applies to the analysis of various online communities. Only students who have participated in RESCH-GE 2140 (Approaches to Qualitative Inquiry) may enroll.             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

Undergraduate, masters and doctoral courses are offered in both general and specialized research areas. [Note: IDRS does not offer stand alone degree programs.]    Because the combinations of research courses required by various programs differ, students are urged to register for these research courses only after consultations with their advisors and, if needed, in consultation with the IDRS co-directors Marc Scott (quantitative) and Lisa Stulberg (qualitative). A set of suggested classes is given next.    NOTE: Applied Statistics courses are now listed primarily as part of the Applied Statistics for Social Science Research (A3SR) masters program and use a new prefix, APSTA. When they have broader appeal and purpose, we list them below.    At the masters and undergraduate level, courses are offered in basic statistics (undergraduate: APSTA-UE 0020 or APSTA-UE 1085; masters: APSTA-GE 2085 - APSTA-GE 2086). Many of the doctoral course offerings are open to advanced master's students. In particular, master's students who intend to take additional statistics classes must begin with APSTA-GE 2001-APSTA-GE 2002, described next, rather than APSTA-GE 2085-APSTA-GE 2086. Consultation with advisor and instructor is highly recommended    At the doctoral level, the required quantitative sequence is statistics for the social and behavioral sciences I &amp; II (APSTA-GE 2001 - APSTA-GE 2002) followed by intermediate and advanced quantitative methods (APSTA-GE 2003 - APSTA-GE 2004). For quantitative work, it is recommended that the first year of statistics be taken in the first year of the course of study. Possible variations on this sequencing may be found on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pages. APSTA-GE 2003-APSTA-GE 2004 are gateway courses that serve as prerequisites for advanced topics such as causal inference (APSTA-GE 2012) and multilevel models (APSTA-GE 2040/41-APSTA-GE 2042).    Biostatistics I &amp; II (APSTA-GE 2995, APSTA-GE 2996) form an alternate first year statistics sequence. They are recommended for master's students specializing in the health professions and for some doctoral students in nursing and health related disciplines. You are advised to consult the links on FAQ pages regarding the appropriateness of this sequence for your field of study.    For graduate students interested in doing qualitative research projects, especially doctoral students who plan to write dissertations involving qualitative interviews or fieldwork, we offer a number of qualitative methods courses. The first class in the series for many students is RESCH-GE 2140. Approaches to Qualitative Inquiry. This is a prerequisite for a number of advanced courses in the qualitative methods series, like RESCH-GE 2141. Case Study and Ethnographic Inquiry, RESCH-GE 2141. Interviewing and Observation, and RESCH-GE 2147. Fieldwork: Data Collection. Other qualitative specialization courses -- which do not require RESCH-GE 2140 as a prerequisite -- include historical research (RESCH-GE 2135) and participatory action research (RESCH-GE 2143).    Doctoral students often take writing empirical research (RESCH-GE 2138) and dissertation proposal seminar (TCHL-GE 3001) as well.    Students should take several 3-point design courses: empirical methods (RESCH-GE 2132) or its equivalent, followed by survey research (APSTA-GE 2139) and/or Large Databases (APSTA-GE 2110).
