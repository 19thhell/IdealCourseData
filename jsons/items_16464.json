the history and theory of art by selecting four courses from one of the tracks in the Visual Arts program. Concentrating in Visual Arts permits students to explore their own creative abilities in a range of media or to ask questions about the evolution of arts practice throughout time and within a variety of cultures.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.

the history and theory of art by selecting four courses from one of the tracks in the Visual Arts program. Concentrating in Visual Arts permits students to explore their own creative abilities in a range of media or to ask questions about the evolution of arts practice throughout time and within a variety of cultures.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

VISAR-AD 126 Interventions: Three-Dimensional Thinking                                                        In this seminar we will study the new NYU Campus in Abu Dhabi and use the campus grounds as a site to develop temporary sculptural interventions in this public or semipublic space. We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualisations of sculpture since the 1960s that have understood the physical location of the work of art as a integral to our perception of it. The evolution of context-related sculpture since the 1960s led in the 1980s and 1990s to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will discuss the differences between them in class and ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. This includes questioning what sort of public a sculptural intervention should take into account and how this public differs from the audience at an art gallery. What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? Over the course of the seminar, we will work out the basic conditions within which we will be allowed to make sculptural interventions on campus. The selected sites will be analyzed in detail. The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.

Students explore multiple aspects of visual design from aesthetics to user interfaces and usability, with special consideration of signage in Abu Dhabi. They also develop graphic designs that respond to the Abu Dhabi environment. Practical exercises that emphasize visual communication skills are central to the class. Students become familiar with the design procedures at the core of successful visual identity systems, thus developing their skills in research methodologies, data gathering, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and creative solutions, team work and monitoring.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.

the history and theory of art by selecting four courses from one of the tracks in the Visual Arts program.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

VISAR-AD 113 Photography as Art and Practice                                                                              Students learn the history, criticism, and variety of theoretical approaches to photography while developing their own skills in the photographic media. The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

VISAR-AD 126 Interventions: Three-Dimensional Thinking                                                        In this seminar we will study the new NYU Campus in Abu Dhabi and use the campus grounds as a site to develop temporary sculptural interventions in this public or semipublic space. We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualisations of sculpture since the 1960s that have understood the physical location of the work of art as a integral to our perception of it. The evolution of context-related sculpture since the 1960s led in the 1980s and 1990s to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will discuss the differences between them in class and ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. This includes questioning what sort of public a sculptural intervention should take into account and how this public differs from the audience at an art gallery. What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? Over the course of the seminar, we will work out the basic conditions within which we will be allowed to make sculptural interventions on campus. The selected sites will be analyzed in detail. The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.

Students explore multiple aspects of visual design from aesthetics to user interfaces and usability, with special consideration of signage in Abu Dhabi. They also develop graphic designs that respond to the Abu Dhabi environment. Practical exercises that emphasize visual communication skills are central to the class. Students become familiar with the design procedures at the core of successful visual identity systems, thus developing their skills in research methodologies, data gathering, analysis, decision making, brainstorming and creative solutions, team work and monitoring.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences.

VISAR-AD 201 Interdisciplinary Projects in the Visual Arts                                                                              This class for experienced students is constructed around a series of projects realized in any available media or medium. How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.

            The major in Art &amp; Art History integrates the traditions of historical, critical, and philosophical thinking that characterize the disciplines of Art History and Aesthetics with practice-based studio art. The courses are divided into two tracks: Art Practice and Art History. Students have the option of specializing in one track or combining the two in equal measure.   The program focuses in particular on three broad geographical regions and their traditions: 1) Europe and North America; 2) the Middle East and North Africa; and 3) South Asia and East Asia. The courses also pay special attention to cross-cultural encounters, to an understanding of art in comparative frameworks, and to the dialogues between the visual arts and the humanities, sciences and other arts.     The studio art courses allow students to explore a range of different media and techniques including drawing and painting, sculpture, photography, video, and digital media, while at the same time letting them hone their skills in a chosen medium. They also require students to reflect critically on the nature of art practices and to understand the traditions, theories, and contexts that inform and mold these practices.     The courses in the history, theory, and criticism of the visual arts address the major issues and debates that have shaped our understanding of the visual arts. Among the questions we confront are: What is art and the nature of aesthetic experience, and why are they differently understood and valued at different times and in different cultures? What is gained or lost by studying art by focusing on a particular place, time, tradition or genre as opposed to approaching it from a comparative perspective that puts two or more cultures in dialogue? What might it mean to think of art as the product of cross-cultural contact? How do institutions such as museums, galleries, funding bodies, and universities influence the creation, dissemination and reception of art? How do we explain the experience of the viewer psychologically, culturally, and historically? How can other disciplines help us better understand the visual arts?     The NYUAD Art &amp; Art History program is closely related to and cross-lists pre-professional courses in Museum and Cultural Heritage Studies, and takes advantage of museums in the region such as the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha and the museums developing on Abu Dhabi\u2019s Saadiyat Island. The major also draws upon the community of practicing artists and scholars resident in or passing through the Gulf whenever possible.     The Art &amp; Art History major prepares students for careers not only as artists or professionals in museums, the arts industries or education, but also for any career where creativity, imagination, analytical ability, conceptual clarity, cross cultural understanding and a respect for human achievement and difference are valued.

Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered \"shared cultural heritage.\" Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York&rsquo;s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required.

It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

Considered as the true global art form of the twentieth century, conceptual art manifests itself in ideas that challenge the current sociopolitical forces of our times and the commonly held notions of what art is about. The course will examine contemporary art from the lens of conceptual art focusing on key works by international artists. Student will examine the definition/s of &lsquo;contemporary&rsquo; and the current debates around the modern and contemporary in relation to Western and non-Western art.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

VISAR-AD 126 Interventions: Three-Dimensional Thinking                                                        In this seminar we will study the new NYU Campus in Abu Dhabi and use the campus grounds as a site to develop temporary sculptural interventions in this public or semipublic space. We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualisations of sculpture since the 1960s that have understood the physical location of the work of art as a integral to our perception of it. The evolution of context-related sculpture since the 1960s led in the 1980s and 1990s to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will discuss the differences between them in class and ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. This includes questioning what sort of public a sculptural intervention should take into account and how this public differs from the audience at an art gallery. What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? Over the course of the seminar, we will work out the basic conditions within which we will be allowed to make sculptural interventions on campus. The selected sites will be analyzed in detail. The students will develop their proposals for interventions with the aid of photographic documentation, models, and a project description before realizing the interventions in coordination with the university administration and presenting them to the public for a limited time.

Any theme/subject and photographic style may be chosen as long as some access to that subject can be gained. Students explore how to approach their subject, develop a theme, and how to choose images that reflect their experiences. They keep a journal, and a final presentation will include a group of photographs and a short personal essay.

VISAR-AD 165J Gardens of Eden in the History of Art                                                                              The garden is one of the oldest modes of human intervention in the environment. This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qu&rsquo;ran where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational figure in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the peoples of the book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and the seminar examines both. We will study gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. To analyze these works, the course introduces fundamental methods of art history as an academic discipline.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required. This course fulfills Art and Art History requirements.    *Note: This course number has now been changed to VISAR-AD 102.

VISAR-AD 201 Interdisciplinary Projects in the Visual Arts                                                                              This class for experienced students is constructed around a series of projects realized in any available media or medium. How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.
