Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Moloney (Music)  s yllabus Drawing from selected studies and recordings of music in a variety of world cultures and a semester-long series of live in-class performances by, and interviews with, some of the world's greatest musicians, we examine the complex roles that music plays in day-to-day life. We explore the ways in which music is learned, composed, performed, admired, critiqued, used, and consumed, and look at the multi-faceted relationships between music and music making and race, gender, sexual preference, class, and regional and national identities. Close attention is paid to the ways in which different kinds of music can function as crucial identity markers, particularly in times of great social change and population movements. We consider the ways we 'hear' music in multiple social situations, such as individual and community rituals, and performance events, such as concerts and festivals, and we also look at how music is 'used' in media forms such as film and television and, more generally, as a commodity in the world market place. We study the increasingly complex ways all of us 'consume' or enjoy music in multiple modalities, from street music to radio, CD players and iPods, and downloading from internet sites. In our journey we familiarize ourselves with and interrogate terms like 'musicality', 'musical literacy', 'musical language', 'orality', 'aurality', and various other analytical and descriptive constructs that have been used in discussions on music and society. Most of all, we try to learn not to take music for granted but to be mindful, appreciative, and questioning of the various ways it touches, and can enrich, our lives.

Are they circumstantial? Some musical practices seem, at least at first sight, non-technological; others are overtly technological and use screens, speakers, computers, and other gadgets, as central aspects of their music. Focusing on experimental electronic and computer music and a diverse range of popular music produced in the 20th and 21st Century, we ask: What is music? What is sound? What is noise? What is music technology? Is music inherently technological? Is technology expressive? FALL 2014 CORE-UA 740, Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics &amp; the Aquila Theatre)  syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary America--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus We screen, read and discuss a range of utopian/dystopian visions of the future as forecast in our popular cinema, and literature. Our screenings explore a range of films from from \u2018sci fi\u2019 to fantasy and horror, extending from the 1950s to the present, and far into the future. We explore varied questions and issues including the increasing prevalence of apocalyptic endings to present and future worlds; contrasts between a fragile democratic \u2018now\u2019 vs. an authoritarian techno-future; race, gender, and sexuality in the \u2018scientifically\u2019 engineered and overdetermined future; class, labor and social privilege among replicants, cyborgs, and humans; the consumption of virtual reality, cyber-sex, and other commodities; post-technological tribalism; future \u2018hoods and cityscapes; warnings of cyber-surveillance, techno-collapse, and eco-disaster.

Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Soucek (Institute of Fine Arts)  syllabus  Indian Court Painting: 1450-1800. Before the twentieth century, the cultural and artistic life of the Indian subcontinent was primarily supported by rulers in various regional centers. During the period, paintings on paper filled several important roles. They fused the indigenous tradition of devotional imagery with new, primarily secular functions. In the Indian cultural tradition paintings provide visual metaphors for various moods, seasons, times of day and concepts. They celebrate the lives and accomplishments of individual rulers through the medium of narrative pictures and portraits. They also recall the lives and personalities of gods and heroes. The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds an important collection of Indian paintings and during the spring of 2015 is hosting a major loan exhibition devoted to Indian art, creating a unique opportunity for students to encounter these works. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Silver (Art History)  syllabus Avant-Garde New York, from the Armory Show to Andy Warhol. New York became the center of avant-garde art-making in the period just after the Second World War, although the city had been preparing for its modernist ascendancy since the early years of the 20th century. We focus on art and its makers--native New Yorkers and out-of-towners, Americans and foreign-born practitioners--who helped shape and refine New York\u2019s extraordinarily rich avant-garde \u201ctradition.\u201d Painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, graphic artists, and set designers will be studied, including Alfred Stieglitz, Raymond Hood, Charles Demuth, Paul Manship, Piet Mondrian, Joseph Cornell, Helen Levitt, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Philip Johnson, and Andy Warhol, as will the context in which their work came into being and flourished--museums, galleries, art schools, patrons, artist neighborhoods, professional organizations, ad hoc associations, and artist \u201changouts.\u201d Topics include: the Stieglitz Circle and 291; The Armory Show (1913); the Paris/New York connection; the founding of the Museum of Modern Art; Marcel Duchamp and New York Dada; the art of the Harlem Renaissance; Frank O\u2019Hara--poet, critic, curator; Street Photography; the birth of Abstract Expressionism; Avant-gardism in Washington Square--Judson Dance Theater; From Madison Avenue to 57th Street--Pop Art Emerges. Includes class excursions to museums, galleries, and other New York art sites. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 721, Expressive Culture: Painting &amp; Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History)  syllabus New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Dang (Music)  syllabus The art of listening through close study of musical performances from a wide range of cultures and places, from Kaluli song to Corsican polyphony, from Cuban rumba to Aboriginal rock. We explore the sensory details of musical sounds, the cultural and historical encounters informing those sounds, and their contemporary circulation in the global marketplace. Through our varied musical excursions, we raise questions about homelands, heritage, and belonging; about the diverse genres of music-making, from mimicry of nature to multi-track remixes, song, dance, and drumming; about music\u2019s role in articulating the individual\u2019s relationship to society, the environment, and the metaphysical world; about language, authenticity, and hybridity; and finally, about the complicated politics of global exchange that influence musical production and consumption. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 750, Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus   Explores the unsettling ability of science fiction and horror movies, or combinations thereof, to depict society\u2019s range of repressed, charged and subversive issues. Many of these films represent a variety of socially constructed identities and differences in their nightmare narratives, monsters and fantastic settings. Covering a roughly historical trajectory of popular horror and sci-fi flicks, we ponder how they engage difference in various social expressions from race, childhood, gender, to ideology, class, and imagined, confabulated representations of the body, including \u2018the post-human condition.\u2019 Readings draw on a number of relevant critical insights and discourses, from psychoanalysis to cultural and class analysis, queer theory, futureology and beyond. Films include Picture of Dorian Gray, Gattica, The Hunger, J.D.\u2019s Revenge, Children of the Corn, Solaris, Forbidden Planet. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 762, Expressive Culture: Viva Verdi Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus  The rich artistic life of Italy between the defeat of Napoleon in 1814 and the consolidation of the fascists in power in the 1920\u2019s. Italy was above all the home of opera, and we explore both the economic side of the \u201copera industry\u201d and the most important works of the peninsula\u2019s greatest composers of the day: Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Puccini, and above all Giuseppe Verdi, the most dominant artistic figure in 19th century Italy. We follow Verdi\u2019s stylistic development from the \u201cgalley years\u201d of the 1840\u2019s through the late masterpieces as well as examine the impact of Italian politics on his operas. We also read works of literature by Stendhal, di Lampedusa, Svevo, and Pirandello, and conclude with Martinetti, Boccioni, and the futurist movement in the visual arts and the relationship of these and other artists to fascism.

Architecture was also imagistic; the forms of temples, palaces and royal and elite tombs visually evoked features of the cosmic landscape, to signify that rituals and ceremonies were played out in accord with cosmological processes. In the Egyptian image world, societal and political issues were important, but its fundamental energy and richness arose from a creative tension deeply meaningful to all Egyptians. We explore the many forms of varied, yet interrelated images which convey the ancient Egyptians\u02bc powerful and culture-shaping concerns about the interactions between Order (Egyptian Maat) and Chaos (Egyptian Isfet), and conclude by considering the reception of images of and from ancient Egypt in modernity.

In the wake of World War II, the United States enjoyed heightened cultural prestige, and New York City became a mecca for innovation in concert, jazz, folk, and electronic music. At the same time, the early Cold War was a time of acute cultural restriction in the US, bound up by restrictive notions of American identity that served as a bulwark against perceived threats abroad and within. Against this backdrop of rapid transformation we consider musical developments in relation to the following conditions: the Red Scare, the expansion and globalization of advertising culture and commercial networks, decolonization, nuclear armament, the aftermath of the Holocaust, mass migrations, and the civil rights struggles of the era. Focusing on a wide range of sounds and aesthetics, we examine how musical thinkers participated in debates about freedom, democracy, propaganda, and totalitarianism.

Focusing on a wide range of sounds and aesthetics, we examine how   musical thinkers participated in debates about freedom, democracy,   propaganda, and totalitarianism. Musical dialogues with the visual arts   and literature receive special attention, as do the resources of the   city, involving attendance of and participation in musical concerts and   happenings. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies)   syllabus From silent cinema to the sound film, from early film to new waves in art cinema, from Weimar to emigr\u00e9 Paris to Hollywood, and across genres from the Western to the adventure story to the epic to the spy tale to film noir, Fritz Lang's movie-making spans a major part of the history of cinema. Ranging across his career in film from Germany to the US and back to Europe, we look at both the diversity and the stylistic/thematic regularity in Lang's body of work to pinpoint how particularly he used cinema in the representation of the interplays of human initiative and the constraints on effective action. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 761 Expressive Culture: La Belle \u00c9poque Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus La Belle \u00c9poque , that period in the life of France\u2019s pre-World War I Third Republic (1871-1914) associated with extraordinary artistic achievement, not only saw Paris emerge as the undisputed Western capital of painting and sculpture, it also was the most important production site for new works of musical theater and, arguably, literature as well. It was during these decades that Impressionism launched its assault on the academic establishment, only itself to be superseded by an ever-changing avant-garde associated first with the nabis, then with fauvism and cubism; that the operas of Bizet, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Massenet and the plays of Sardou and Rostand filled the world\u2019s theaters; and that the novels of Zola and stories of Maupassant were translated into dozens of languages. Finally, this was the society that gave birth to one of the greatest literary works of all time, Marcel Proust\u2019s Remembrances of Things Past, the first volume of which appeared just as the First World War was about to bring the Belle \u00c9poque to a violent end. Sources include reproductions of paintings, recordings of chamber music, opera and m\u00e9lodies, and several of the most significant novels of the period.  top of page           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Expressive Culture    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum              Back to Home       Expressive Culture | 2011-2012  *indicates a provisional syllabus **indicates an example syllabus  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 711 Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel Prof. Borenstein (Russian and Slavic Studies) syllabus Examines the interplay between words and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film.

FALL 2011 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Staynek (Music) syllabus Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case studies we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.

SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. Daughtry (Music) syllabus An experimental study of and engagement with the human voice that seeks to understand the voice as: (1) the result of a complex physiological process, (2) the one truly universal musical instrument, (3) a privileged medium for communication (4) a technologically mediated commodity; (5) a potent social weapon, and (6) a vehicle for expressive culture. We attend to voices deployed to effect political change, voices used as instruments of healing, and voices that make the hair rise up on the back of your neck. We also use our own voices in unorthodox ways, composing and making a chorus of sounds together. No prior singing or music experience is expected or required; students must, however, be willing to participate in vocal exercises, ranging from whispers to primal screams.

What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary Americ--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability.

FALL 2014 CORE-UA 730, Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Moloney (Music)  s yllabus Drawing from selected studies and recordings of music in a variety of world cultures and a semester-long series of live in-class performances by, and interviews with, some of the world's greatest musicians, we examine the complex roles that music plays in day-to-day life. We explore the ways in which music is learned, composed, performed, admired, critiqued, used, and consumed, and look at the multi-faceted relationships between music and music making and race, gender, sexual preference, class, and regional and national identities. Close attention is paid to the ways in which different kinds of music can function as crucial identity markers, particularly in times of great social change and population movements. We consider the ways we 'hear' music in multiple social situations, such as individual and community rituals, and performance events, such as concerts and festivals, and we also look at how music is 'used' in media forms such as film and television and, more generally, as a commodity in the world market place. We study the increasingly complex ways all of us 'consume' or enjoy music in multiple modalities, from street music to radio, CD players and iPods, and downloading from internet sites. In our journey we familiarize ourselves with and interrogate terms like 'musicality', 'musical literacy', 'musical language', 'orality', 'aurality', and various other analytical and descriptive constructs that have been used in discussions on music and society. Most of all, we try to learn not to take music for granted but to be mindful, appreciative, and questioning of the various ways it touches, and can enrich, our lives.

Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Soucek (Institute of Fine Arts)  syllabus  Indian Court Painting: 1450-1800. Before the twentieth century, the cultural and artistic life of the Indian subcontinent was primarily supported by rulers in various regional centers. During the period, paintings on paper filled several important roles. They fused the indigenous tradition of devotional imagery with new, primarily secular functions. In the Indian cultural tradition paintings provide visual metaphors for various moods, seasons, times of day and concepts. They celebrate the lives and accomplishments of individual rulers through the medium of narrative pictures and portraits. They also recall the lives and personalities of gods and heroes. The Metropolitan Museum of Art holds an important collection of Indian paintings and during the spring of 2015 is hosting a major loan exhibition devoted to Indian art, creating a unique opportunity for students to encounter these works.

We explore the sensory details of musical sounds, the cultural and historical encounters informing those sounds, and their contemporary circulation in the global marketplace. Through our varied musical excursions, we raise questions about homelands, heritage, and belonging; about the diverse genres of music-making, from mimicry of nature to multi-track remixes, song, dance, and drumming; about music\u2019s role in articulating the individual\u2019s relationship to society, the environment, and the metaphysical world; about language, authenticity, and hybridity; and finally, about the complicated politics of global exchange that influence musical production and consumption.

Architecture was also imagistic; the forms of temples, palaces and royal and elite tombs visually evoked features of the cosmic landscape, to signify that rituals and ceremonies were played out in accord with cosmological processes. In the Egyptian image world, societal and political issues were important, but its fundamental energy and richness arose from a creative tension deeply meaningful to all Egyptians. We explore the many forms of varied, yet interrelated images which convey the ancient Egyptians\u02bc powerful and culture-shaping concerns about the interactions between Order (Egyptian Maat) and Chaos (Egyptian Isfet), and conclude by considering the reception of images of and from ancient Egypt in modernity.

Ranging across his career in film from Germany to the US and back to Europe, we look at both the diversity and the stylistic/thematic regularity in Lang's body of work to pinpoint how particularly he used cinema in the representation of the interplays of human initiative and the constraints on effective action. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 761 Expressive Culture: La Belle \u00c9poque Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus La Belle \u00c9poque , that period in the life of France\u2019s pre-World War I Third Republic (1871-1914) associated with extraordinary artistic achievement, not only saw Paris emerge as the undisputed Western capital of painting and sculpture, it also was the most important production site for new works of musical theater and, arguably, literature as well. It was during these decades that Impressionism launched its assault on the academic establishment, only itself to be superseded by an ever-changing avant-garde associated first with the nabis, then with fauvism and cubism; that the operas of Bizet, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Massenet and the plays of Sardou and Rostand filled the world\u2019s theaters; and that the novels of Zola and stories of Maupassant were translated into dozens of languages. Finally, this was the society that gave birth to one of the greatest literary works of all time, Marcel Proust\u2019s Remembrances of Things Past, the first volume of which appeared just as the First World War was about to bring the Belle \u00c9poque to a violent end. Sources include reproductions of paintings, recordings of chamber music, opera and m\u00e9lodies, and several of the most significant novels of the period.  top of page           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Expressive Culture    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum              Back to Home       Expressive Culture | 2011-2012  *indicates a provisional syllabus **indicates an example syllabus  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 711 Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel Prof. Borenstein (Russian and Slavic Studies) syllabus Examines the interplay between words and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology, time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures? What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns, Carla Speed McNeil.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 722 Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study  Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.   FALL 2011 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Staynek (Music) syllabus Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case studies we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.  FALL 2011 MAP-UA 750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies)  syllabus  A range of utopian/dystopian visions of the future as forecast in our popular cinema, and literature, in a range of films from 'sci fi' to fantasy and horror, extending from the 1950s to the present. Questions and issues include the increasing prevalence of apocalyptic endings to present and future worlds; contrasts between a fragile democratic \u2018now\u2019 vs. an authoritarian techno-future; race, gender, and sexuality in the \u2018scientifically\u2019 engineered and overdetermined future; class, labor, and social privilege among replicants, cyborgs, and humans; the consumption of virtual reality, cyber-sex, and other commodities; post-technological tribalism; future 'hoods &amp; cityscapes; warnings of cyber-surveillance, techno-collapse, and eco-disaster. Finally, we ask: what is 'utopia,' how is it 'imagined,' and is it still possible? Screenings and readings from the likes of George Orwell, Ray Kurzweil, Paul Vrilio, Aldous Huxley, among others.  SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 720 Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Silver (Art History) syllabus Avant-Garde New York, from the Armory Show to Andy Warhol. New York became the center of avant-garde art-making in the period just after the Second World War, although the city had been preparing for its modernist ascendancy since the early years of the 20th century. We focus on art and its makers--native New Yorkers and out-of-towners, Americans and foreign-born practitioners--who helped shape and refine New York\u2019s extraordinarily rich avant-garde \u201ctradition.\u201d Painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, graphic artists, and set designers will be studied, including Alfred Stieglitz, Raymond Hood, Charles Demuth, Paul Manship, Piet Mondrian, Joseph Cornell, Helen Levitt, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Philip Johnson, and Andy Warhol, as will the context in which their work came into being and flourished--museums, galleries, art schools, patrons, artist neighborhoods, professional organizations, ad hoc associations, and artist \u201changouts.\u201d Topics include: the Stieglitz Circle and 291; The Armory Show (1913); the Paris/New York connection; the founding of the Museum of Modern Art; Marcel Duchamp and New York Dada; the art of the Harlem Renaissance; Frank O\u2019Hara--poet, critic, curator; Street Photography; the birth of Abstract Expressionism; Avant-gardism in Washington Square--Judson Dance Theater; From Madison Avenue to 57th Street--Pop Art Emerges. Includes class excursions to museums, galleries, and other New York art sites.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 721 Expressive Culture: Images\u2014Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History)  syllabus  New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are exhibited. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Cultures: Sounds Prof. Daughtry (Music) syllabus An experimental study of and engagement with the human voice that seeks to understand the voice as: (1) the result of a complex physiological process, (2) the one truly universal musical instrument, (3) a privileged medium for communication (4) a technologically mediated commodity; (5) a potent social weapon, and (6) a vehicle for expressive culture. We attend to voices deployed to effect political change, voices used as instruments of healing, and voices that make the hair rise up on the back of your neck. We also use our own voices in unorthodox ways, composing and making a chorus of sounds together. No prior singing or music experience is expected or required; students must, however, be willing to participate in vocal exercises, ranging from whispers to primal screams. SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 740 Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics/Aquila Theatre Company) syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary Americ--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability.   SPRING 2012 MAP-UA 750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Simon (Cinema Studies) syllabus American narrative films, produced primarily during the period 1965-75, considered as an innovative cycle of filmmaking in dialogue with significant historical, political, and cultural transformations in American society.
