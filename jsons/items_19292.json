Affinity chromatography is used to produce purified preparations of wild-type and mutant protein complexes. The purified protein complexes are compared using a wide variety of biochemical techniques, including silver-stained SDS-PAGE, western blot, colorimetric enzymatic assay, and protein interaction assays. Yeast expressing the same mutants is used in genetic experiments to evaluate the importance of the protein complex in cell growth and gene regulation in the cell.
