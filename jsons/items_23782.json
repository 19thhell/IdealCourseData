At NYU Steinhardt's Art + Education program, you have access to:       The East Village and New York City, the cultural capital of the world, including world-renowned museums such as The New Museum, MoMA, and the Whitney Museum, along with nearby galleries in the Lower East Side and Chelsea    carefully supervised teaching placements and internships in New York's finest schools and cultural institutions    an internationally renowned and dedicated faculty of artist/educators, many of whom are full time K-12 teachers in schools across the city    studio courses taught by leading contemporary artists    a comprehensive and balanced curriculum in visual art and social studies education and pedagogy that combines theory with teaching practice    a richly diverse and multicultural educational community committed to social justice       This program offers a MA with dual certification in Art Education (all grades) and Social Studies Education (grades 7-12). This dual-degree program models critical and investigatory education that empowers students to think beyond subject area. A fundamental component of this program is collaboration across two departments in Steinhardt: the Department of Teaching and Learning and the Department of Art and Art Professions. Students take courses in both departments and have the opportunity to engage with and learn from students and faculty across Steinhardt. Students must apply to the Art Education Program initially and fulfill all admissions requirements, including a visual portfolio, and then meet the admissions requirements for the Social Studies Education program in Teaching and Learning. With a special focus on contemporary art  and its social context, this program conceptualizes the artist-educator as cultural worker, intellectual, and activist. Students are involved in integrated learning opportunities that re-imagine both art and social studies education. As part of the program&rsquo;s emphasis on praxis, graduate students teach a 9-week NYU Visionary Studio  Saturday Workshop for high school students from across New York City. This field experience allows Art Education students to establish a dialogue between theory introduced in the seminar and practice in the classroom, as well as develop their teaching style as they design and implement a thematic unit plan based on social issues. In addition, students spend two-semesters in student teaching placements in New York City schools at both the elementary and secondary level with the guidance and support of experienced NYU faculty supervisors.    Personal attention is given to each student throughout the duration of program, from initial advisement through completion of the final master's project. Classes are small, and Special Projects and Guest Speakers offer additional professional opportunities and experiences.    For students who have an undergraduate BA or BFA degree and wish to acquire teacher certification, this dual degree program offers a curriculum that satisfies the academic requirements for New York State initial teacher certification in Visual Art (all grades) and Social Studies (grades 7-12). Students are required to fulfill all additional New York State Department of Education Certification requirements including mandatory tests and assessments. Note: This 44-credit program begins in the Summer semester and can be completed in as little as 3 semesters or 12 months as a full-time student. The program can also be completed as a part-time student in two years. The NYU Steinhardt Teacher Education Program is fully accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council.    Certification Requirements    In addition to completing all coursework, students must successfully complete all required New York State Teacher Certification Examinations and Assessments . Scores must be submitted to the New York State Education Department before it will consider issuing a certificate to teach in public schools in New York State.    Currently all candidates seeking dual certification in Visual Arts (all grades) and Social Studies (Grades 7-12) are required to take the following exams: LAST, Elem or Sec ATS-W (not both), Visual Arts Content Specialty Test.    The NYSED anticipates that candidates applying for certification on or after May 1, 2014 will be required to take new exams , please see details on the NYSED website here and from the NYS Teacher Certification Examinations website .

At NYU Steinhardt's Art + Education program, you have access to:       The East Village and New York City, the cultural capital of the world, including world-renowned museums such as The New Museum, MoMA, and the Whitney Museum, along with nearby galleries in the Lower East Side and Chelsea    carefully supervised teaching placements and internships in New York's finest schools and cultural institutions    an internationally renowned and dedicated faculty of artist/educators, many of whom are full time K-12 teachers in schools across the city    studio courses taught by leading contemporary artists    a comprehensive and balanced curriculum in visual art and social studies education and pedagogy that combines theory with teaching practice    a richly diverse and multicultural educational community committed to social justice       This program offers a MA with dual certification in Art Education (all grades) and Social Studies Education (grades 7-12). This dual-degree program models critical and investigatory education that empowers students to think beyond subject area. A fundamental component of this program is collaboration across two departments in Steinhardt: the Department of Teaching and Learning and the Department of Art and Art Professions. Students take courses in both departments and have the opportunity to engage with and learn from students and faculty across Steinhardt. Students must apply to the Art Education Program initially and fulfill all admissions requirements, including a visual portfolio, and then meet the admissions requirements for the Social Studies Education program in Teaching and Learning. With a special focus on contemporary art  and its social context, this program conceptualizes the artist-educator as cultural worker, intellectual, and activist. Students are involved in integrated learning opportunities that re-imagine both art and social studies education. As part of the program&rsquo;s emphasis on praxis, graduate students teach a 9-week NYU Visionary Studio  Saturday Workshop for high school students from across New York City. This field experience allows Art Education students to establish a dialogue between theory introduced in the seminar and practice in the classroom, as well as develop their teaching style as they design and implement a thematic unit plan based on social issues. In addition, students spend two-semesters in student teaching placements in New York City schools at both the elementary and secondary level with the guidance and support of experienced NYU faculty supervisors.    Personal attention is given to each student throughout the duration of program, from initial advisement through completion of the final master's project. Classes are small, and Special Projects and Guest Speakers offer additional professional opportunities and experiences.    For students who have an undergraduate BA or BFA degree and wish to acquire teacher certification, this dual degree program offers a curriculum that satisfies the academic requirements for New York State initial teacher certification in Visual Art (all grades) and Social Studies (grades 7-12). Students are required to fulfill all additional New York State Department of Education Certification requirements including mandatory tests and assessments. Note: This 44-credit program begins in the Summer semester and can be completed in as little as 3 semesters or 12 months as a full-time student. The program can also be completed as a part-time student in two years. The NYU Steinhardt Teacher Education Program is fully accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council.    Certification Requirements    In addition to completing all coursework, students must successfully complete all required New York State Teacher Certification Examinations and Assessments . Scores must be submitted to the New York State Education Department before it will consider issuing a certificate to teach in public schools in New York State.
