His final dissertation was entitled \u201cSinceritas eterna: half-light. Ezra Pound e l\u2019ultimo Pasolini.\u201d Now at NYU he is exploring twentieth century Italian and European literature, following all the deviations his research will hopefully suggest. In addition, Riccardo follows the many ways in which cinema studies and film analysis go hand in hand with literary criticism, helping to piece together the various images and voices of Man in the 20th-century. He recently published an article entitled \u201cUn\u2019oscura energia nel riconoscere\u201d in Strumenti Critici about scenes of recognition in War and Peace and Thomas Mann\u2019s Joseph.                Franco Baldasso graduated in modern Italian literature at the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi of Bologna, where he worked as a journalist and editor. His research focuses on 20th century literature and intellectual history, the negotiations between fiction and historical discourse as well as the legacy of the Holocaust and World War II in Italy. After some publications on Primo Levi and his works for the journal Poetiche , he published his first book, Il cerchio di gesso . Primo Levi narratore e testimone (2007). He also edited a series of photographical volumes about the city of Florence from the Risorgimento to the economic boom of the 1960s for the newspaper La Nazione . His articles appeared in Modern Language Notes , Context , Nemla-Italian Studies and Scritture Migranti . Franco received his MA at NYU with a thesis on the representation of the Balkans in Italian culture, and he is now completing his dissertation titled, Against Redemption: The Debate over Italian History during the Transition from Fascism to Democracy . He has been the recipient of many awards, such as the A.W. Mellon Dissertation Fellowship in the Humanities, the Humanities Initiative Honorary Fellowship and the Remarque Institute Doctoral Fellowship.             Giovanni Braico is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Italian Studies at NYU. He graduated with a degree in Foreign Languages and Literature from Universit \u00e0 della Calabria, Italy, and received his M.A. in Italian Studies from Boston College. Giovanni has also spent a semester abroad studying Spanish Literature at the Universitat Aut \u00f2 noma de Barcelona, Spain while he was enrolled at the Universit \u00e0 della Calabria. He is author of an article entitled \"Il dissidio sull'esistenza dell'inferno nel tardo medioevo: la posizione di Dante\" that will be published in the journal, Dante: rivista internazionale di studi su Dante Alighieri in November 2011. Giovanni's research interests include the justification of vendetta in medieval and early modern literature and the relationship between rhetoric and power.             Bryan Brazeau (B.A., Concordia University, 2008; M.A., New York University 2010) is currently working on a dissertation that examines the portrayal of interiority in sixteenth-century Christian epics written in Italy. He is the author of \u201c \u2018Who Wants to Live Forever?\u2019 Overcoming Poetic Immortality in Tasso's Gerusalemme Conquistata ,\u201d MLN 129, No.1 (Italian Issue, January, 2014) and \" 'I fight auctoritas, auctoritas always wins': Siger of Brabant, Paradiso X and Dante\u2019s Textual Authority,\u201d in Dante and Heterodoxy: The Temptation of Radical Thought in the 13th century, ed. Maria Luisa Ardizzone (Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Press, forthcoming 2014) and of the NYU Guide to Medieval and Early Modern Research in Italian Studies . His research interests include early modern conceptions of genre (specifically lyric and epic), the interaction between classical culture and religious values during the Counter-Reformation, chivalric epic (Boiardo, Ariosto, Tasso), cultural transactions between early modern Italy and Spain, along with digital humanities projects.             Paolo Campolonghi graduated in philosophy of science from the Universit\u00e0 Statale degli Studi di Milano and he received a M.A. in Italian Cultural Studies from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His main research interests include critical and political theory, biopolitics, Holocaust representation, globalization and imperialism, history and philosophy of science (particularly the concepts of \"crisis\", scientific realism and scientific revolution), cinema and visual culture. He has worked on Primo Levi, Agamben, Gramsci and Pasolini. Currently, he is focusing on global citizenship and situations of \u201cexception\u201d to the Nation-State paradigm, and on the figure of the intellectual in the very recent years of Italian history.             Valeria G. Castelli is a Ph.D. Candidate in Italian Studies at New York University. She received her Laurea in Lettere Moderne from the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore di Milano and her M.A. in Italian Studies from the University College of London. Her research interests include Modern and Contemporary Italian Literature, Italian Cultural Studies and Cinema, Documentary Film Theory and History. She published an interview with Giorgio Diritti in Zoom \u201cd\u2019oltreoceano\u201d: istantanee sui registi italiani e sull\u2019Italia (Rome: Vecchiarelli, 2010) and a peer-reviewed article, \u201cIs Citizen Berlusconi good for democracy?

She wrote a chapter for the forthcoming Italian language textbook adopted by the Department of Italian Studies at NYU. She is the co-editor, with Jonathan Mullins and Alessandra Montalbano, of a peer-reviewed book, Denuncia: Speaking Up in Modern Italy, under contract with Fairleigh Dickinson University Press (http://nyudenuncia.wordpress.com/). Valeria is currently in Italy writing her dissertation provisionally entitled \u201cDenouncing Injustice and Illegality: The Politics of Truth in Contemporary Italian Documentary Film (2001-2011).\u201d       Brian DeGrazia holds a B.A. in Comparative Literature from Dartmouth College (2008) and an M.A. in Italian Studies from NYU (2012). His M.A. thesis, \u201c\u2019La morta poes\u00ec: irony in Pasolini\u2019s Sal\u00f2\u2019\u201d explores how the film\u2019s intertextuality destabilizes and ultimately destroys both filmic and historical narrative. Brian has continued to develop his research interests in 20th century Italian literature and cinema, in particular within the work of Pasolini and the Gruppo 63. His dissertation, however, offers a critical history of the HIV/AIDS crisis as it has manifested in Italy. The project engages with biopolitical theory to examine the role of the Italian state and the Catholic Church in regulating persons infected with HIV and their bodies, and in constructing representations of them and discourse about them, as HIV became not just a disease but a point of cultural identification and signification.       Lindsay Eufusia is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Italian Studies.
