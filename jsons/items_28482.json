While the convergence of these forms has been predicted and expected for several years, 2006 was a watershed year for Internet Television with such milestones as the launch of Google Video, the rise of YouTube, and the availability of Lost on iTunes. The potential of Internet Television is twofold: First, to empower viewers to watch what they want to watch when and where they want to experience it. Second, to empower content creators with a rich new medium for which to develop innovative types of entertainment experiences that leverage full motion video, interactivity and a ubiquitous \u201cconnectivity.\u201d This course explores the history, current mainstream emergence, and predicted future of several different experience categories that make up the world of Internet Television. Categories in focus include the \u201c2 foot\u201d PC-based broadband video experience, the \u201csix inch\u201d mobile video experience, and the \u201cten foot\u201d experience of the living room television + internet-enabled set-top box. What opportunities to create new forms of entertainment or communication are enabled by the mainstream emergence of these various flavors of Internet Television? This question is approached from two angles: the creative and the practical. On a practical level, the class covers some of the specific technical steps involved in preparing video, designing interfaces and coding interactivity for a variety of Internet Television platforms. During the semester, students are required to pick one of these platforms to research and present to the class in greater depth. On a creative level, students are expected to review and prepare regular critiques of various examples of Internet Television content and develop their own creative concepts for Internet Television properties to \u201cpitch\u201d to the class. The class provides feedback and explores the aesthetics and boundaries of this emerging medium. At the end of the semester, students present a more fully flushed out proposal for a specific \u201cconcept\u201d for an Internet Television property. The class has periodic drop-in visits from executives in the entertainment, advertising, and consumer electronics industries to provide perspective on the current trends and opportunities for innovation.

This course is credited towards History and Criticism for UGFTV majors.    There are no criteria for an avant-garde film or video, only the expectation that by watching it a viewer will be introduced to a challenging, refreshingly unfamiliar language that, by the end of the piece, he or she will have begun to speak. This new language may be politically confrontational, aesthetically difficult, lyrical, or rhythmic, but no matter what the form, it will express the particular vision of the artist who produced it. Challenging as this work may be for any audience, a close viewing of these \"avant-garde\" pieces will expand on your appreciation of their poetry and complexity. Whether you call these films experimental, alternative, independent, personal or poetic, they share very little save for their adventurous desire to reawaken those dormant visual and aural sensibilities that may have been hypnotized into years of sleep by too much commercial, mainstream media.    Lynne Sachs is a filmmaker who exposes the limitations of verbal language with complex emotional and visual vistas; her intricately layered films explode the borders between genres, racialized identities, psychic states and nations. Her work has been screen at Sundance, MOMA and abroad.
