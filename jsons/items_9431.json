About ITS Technology Security Services    The ITS Technology Security Services group (TSS) provides a wide variety of services to the general NYU community that help minimize the risk of a security incident. It is our mission to protect NYU's computer network and the data that is transmitted     over it. TSS meets with NYU departments to discuss their security concerns, provides consultations on new projects, and educates University employees on how to safely and securely navigate NYU-NET resources.    TSS keeps in close contact with outside security     organizations, researches new trends and industry happenings, and collaborates in disseminating new information to the general community. TSS monitors newsgroups and mailing lists for any new vulnerabilities or outbreaks in order to inform and protect NYU users. We are constantly     seeking ways to enhance our services and to educate ourselves so that we can further protect the NYU    community.   An overview of our services is provided below. For some important security recommendations, please explore the tabs above.   What We Do      Incident Investigation   Vulnerability Scans   Education   Research and Development      Incident Investigation   TSS responds to incident reports regarding the security of NYU's computers, data, and networks. Incident response includes tracking down infected computers, contacting external Internet service providers, and monitoring network traffic for possible break-ins. TSS is involved in high-impact incidents such as emergency response, sensitive data disclosures, serious network events, and, when appropriate, participation in investigations conducted by either NYU Public Safety or external law enforcement agencies.    Vulnerability Scans   TSS continuously evaluates New York University's computers, networks, data, and personal workstations through a variety of methods, including general network scans. Upon request by systems administrators, our group will scan computers and networks to test for vulnerabilities and exploits.    Education   The TSS group actively seeks to develop greater security awareness by educating the NYU community on how to safely use a variety of technologies. We identify, research, and promote \"best practices\" regarding the security of data and systems.    Through various means, the TSS group alerts the general NYU community of security issues and instructs users on computer security best practices. These methods include, but are not limited to, the Security Alerts mailing list, the Security Alerts section on NYU Home, and the Computer Security Alerts and Computer Security News web pages. The TSS group also publishes important security articles in Connect magazine.    As a result of research and development, we also implement new concepts for security training sessions and broader security initiatives.    Research and Development   TSS reviews existing and innovative communications applications and assesses secure applications for use at the University and in University projects. We also assist in instituting campus standards for security and review applicable policies and procedures in the context of these standards.

About ITS Technology Security Services    The ITS Technology Security Services group (TSS) provides a wide variety of services to the general NYU community that help minimize the risk of a security incident. It is our mission to protect NYU's computer network and the data that is transmitted     over it. TSS meets with NYU departments to discuss their security concerns, provides consultations on new projects, and educates University employees on how to safely and securely navigate NYU-NET resources.    TSS keeps in close contact with outside security     organizations, researches new trends and industry happenings, and collaborates in disseminating new information to the general community. TSS monitors newsgroups and mailing lists for any new vulnerabilities or outbreaks in order to inform and protect NYU users. We are constantly     seeking ways to enhance our services and to educate ourselves so that we can further protect the NYU    community.   An overview of our services is provided below. For some important security recommendations, please explore the tabs above.   What We Do      Incident Investigation   Vulnerability Scans   Education   Research and Development      Incident Investigation   TSS responds to incident reports regarding the security of NYU's computers, data, and networks. Incident response includes tracking down infected computers, contacting external Internet service providers, and monitoring network traffic for possible break-ins. TSS is involved in high-impact incidents such as emergency response, sensitive data disclosures, serious network events, and, when appropriate, participation in investigations conducted by either NYU Public Safety or external law enforcement agencies.

The seminar addresses a variety of perspectives on security in a digital age, including security of information and software, computer networks, cyber-physical systems and infrastructure and will include discussions about national as well as international cyber-security law and policy. We host talks about ongoing research and initiatives and provides a platform for integrating technical, cyber and information security issues with broader societal and legal dynamics.   The seminar was launched in January 2014 and is a collaboration of the Information Law Institute , the Center on Law and Security at NYU School of Law, the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Security and Privacy at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, and Steinhardt\u2019s Department of Media, Culture, and Communication . We welcome participation from all NYU faculty, research affiliates, and graduate students, as well as experts in neighboring institutions. However, attendance at meetings is generally limited to those who can commit to ongoing participation during the semester. The seminar is hosted bi-weekly, alternating between locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Please contact seminar coordinator and Postdoctoral Fellow at the Information law Institute, Joris van Hoboken if you would like to discuss joining the group or want to suggest work-in-progress that would be suitable to present.
