Choosing to study away is  a simple process designed to help students understand their options and make  sure that the courses fit well into their overall academic plan. The NYU global  academic centers offer NYU courses in NYU-managed academic facilities, a  full-time staff, faculty hired locally and appointed by a committee in New  York, and guaranteed student housing assignments. The international exchange  program allows students to enroll directly at an approved exchange partner  university while remaining as an NYU student paying NYU tuition and retaining  the same NYU financial aid award.          First,  students should contact the Office of Global Programs (212-998-4433; www.nyu.edu/studyaway ) for information  on all study away options.          Second,  they should consult their academic adviser in the College Advising Center  (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130), or, if  they have already declared a major, their department, for more detailed and  customized advice and approval of a specific course of study. Before students  can register for study away courses, their adviser must approve the course work  they will complete.          Finally, students who are interested in studying at a  NYU global academic center should submit an application online through the  Application Center in Albert. Consult www.nyu.edu/studyaway   for fall and spring semester application deadlines. Applicants are encouraged  to plan ahead and apply early, as some programs fill quickly.          Requests  are processed and reviewed by the Office of Global Programs, as well as by the  Office of the Associate Dean for Students. Considerations used in determining  whether the program is appropriate for the applicant include academic and  disciplinary standing and progress to degree. Confirmation letters are sent  directly to the applicant with instructions for registration, pre-departure  arrangements, and orientation information.          Students who wish to study away in a non-NYU program must  petition the associate dean for students in writing, showing academic  justification for choosing the program. After the petition has been reviewed,  the student will be informed of the outcome. For further information, contact  the Office of the Associate Dean for Students (Silver Center, Room 909B;  212-998-8140).

NYU  BERLIN           At  NYU Berlin, located in the trendy Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood in central  Berlin, students experience a cosmopolitan city that holds a complex and  crucial place in modern European history. Youthful, artistic, and hip, Berlin  has traveled a path that led from the defining cultural avant-garde of the  Weimar Republic to the devastation of World War II, from a divided city  symbolizing the Cold War to today's reunified and renewed capital.          The  program at NYU Berlin is designed for students in the social sciences and  humanities who want to earn credit in their majors\u2014including sociology,  history, politics, studio art, environmental studies and European studies\u2014while  having a transformative experience abroad. Courses are taught in English, and  German language courses are offered at all levels. Day trips and guided  excursions in and around Berlin are included in the program.          All  NYU Berlin students live in the lively district of Kreuzberg in a NYU-managed  residence hall. Students share double rooms and enjoy spacious common areas and  a film screening studio. Outdoors, there is a well-manicured green space, which  invites students to study and relax. Student housing is located just a short  walk from two major subway lines, making the commute to classes at the Global  academic center about 35\u201340 minutes by public transport.          In  addition, Arts and Science sponsors a six-week summer program that offers  students the opportunity to study German language, literature, film, art, and architecture;  experience the cultural life of Europe's most exciting capital city; encounter  the traces of German history; and explore the transformation of the former  capital of the Cold War into a city that connects Eastern and Western Europe.  For more information, please consult www.nyu.edu/summer .                   NYU  BUENOS AIRES           NYU  Buenos Aires offers students the exceptional opportunity to learn about the  people, history, culture, politics, and economy of Argentina and the region  while living in one of South America's most vibrant cities. Courses are taught  in Spanish and English by some of Argentina's most talented scholars,  journalists, and public health professionals, as well as renowned writers and  musicians. The curriculum provides a cultural framework for coursework in  subjects ranging from art history, cinema studies, and creative writing to  politics, sociology, and economics. All students at NYU Buenos Aires take a  Spanish language course at their appropriate level upon arrival or, if they  possess advanced skills, an elective in the language.          A  place of renewed growth and prosperity, Buenos Aires is one of the most  important financial and cultural centers in Latin America. The NYU global  academic center is located in the handsome Recoleta district, near vibrant  Avenida Santa Fe. Staff members organize and offer a myriad of activities for  students to take part in, ranging from regional travel to destinations such as  Iguazu Falls, Rosario, and Tigre to taking tango lessons throughout the  semester. Volunteer opportunities at local NGOs and media offices open doors  for students to engage in the community and practice Spanish. Museums, class  field trips, and concerts offer opportunities to go beyond day-to-day cultural  experiences and better understand the dynamic past and present of the Argentine  capital. Students live in homestays which brings the everyday Argentine way of  living to life as students share meals, ideas and activities with their host  parents.              NYU  FLORENCE      NYU  Florence offers a strong and coherent humanities curriculum of art history,  history, cinema and literature, alongside a focused concentration in social  research, public policy and law. Each of these two separate but not unrelated  parts takes advantage not only of the extraordinary cultural resources provided  by the city of Florence and Italy in general, but also of a unique array of  cocurricular lectures and activities through the La Pietra Dialogues series  that make the Florence campus a dynamic center for scholarly activity and  global policy discussions. Cultural activities and field trips in and  around Florence and Tuscany are an integral part of the cocurricular program.          Courses are taught in English. Italian language courses  are available at all levels, and an intensive Italian Language Program is  available for beginning students who want to accelerate their language  acquisition and engage with Florentine culture at the same time. Students with  advanced proficiency in Italian may take courses taught in Italian at the NYU  global academic center or may directly enroll in courses at the University of  Florence for up to half of their coursework.          The  academic center is located just north of the city center on a magnificent  57-acre estate bequeathed to the University by Sir Harold Acton, a  distinguished patron of the arts. The estate is comprised of five villas, most  notably La Pietra, which houses an early Renaissance art and furniture  collection, and its grounds feature one of the most authentically restored  Renaissance gardens in all of Tuscany.          Some  students reside on the estate in one of two villas that have been dedicated to  student housing; other students live in downtown Florence in shared residences  or in a homestay in an Italian household.          Arts  and Science sponsors a six-week summer program in Florence that offers courses  in language, literature, culture, history, art, and architecture, providing  students with a framework for understanding both the traditions of the past and  the richness of contemporary culture in Florence. Lectures are supplemented  with field study in museums and sites in and around the city.      In  addition, the College of Arts and Science Creative Writing Program offers  Writers in Florence, a specialized program in which students focus on either  poetry or fiction and participate in daily workshops and craft classes where  they receive guidance from accomplished professional writers. Course work  includes readings and lectures by Florence-based writers and publishing  professionals. Program faculty and staff plan literary walking tours, as well  as visits to parks, restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and historic homes of famous writers.          For  information on either summer program in Florence, please consult www.nyu.edu/summer .                   NYU  LONDON           Centrally  located in Bloomsbury, the heart of London's university district, students at  NYU London take advantage of a wide range of academic programs complemented by  the rich cultural experience of living in one of Europe's most storied cities.  Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture,  business, mathematics, British literature and writing, prehealth, and  psychology. Additionally, NYU is one of the only institutions in London to  offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application  Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. Fieldwork and site visits are a  regular part of many classes and students may enroll in for-credit internships  with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law,  politics, health, and theatre.          The  global academic center, a converted 18th-century town house, is located on  historic Bedford Square near many museums and public parks and gardens. The  center offers classrooms, a computer lab, and a student resource room. Students  live nearby in NYU-arranged residences close to public transportation, the shops of the Brunswick Center, and the West End  (London's theatre district).          Students  can take advantage of guided tours to places such as the British Museum,  Shakespeare's Globe, the Tate Gallery, Westminster Abbey, and the Tower of  London.

Many  students live in homestays with Spanish host families, which encourages them to  build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to  practice speaking in a more casual environment. Other students live in  privately-owned apartments. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students  together with local students to practice their Spanish and make friends.      The  Arts and Science six-week summer session in Madrid provides instruction at the  elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels of spoken and written Spanish;  contemporary Spanish culture and literature; and Spanish theatre, cinema, and  art history.

Of Body and Brush: Grand Sacrifice as Text/Performance in 18th century China resulted. My longest-standing interest remains the relationship between the psyche and the soma\u2014how do human beings deal with their imaginative capacities, make worlds and live with themselves and one another? How do we mediate these relationships, starting with the gestures of the body and the intricacies of language and moving through other media including video and film? At NYU I teach anthropology and history of Chinese culture and religions; theories and methods in the study of religion; and several courses on how social life, especially religious and ethical life, is materialized by people through various media forms. Vist my website www.angelazito.com/    Since 2004, I have been involved in the independent documentary scene in China, serving on film festival juries, hosting screenings of Chinese filmmakers in New York. As part of an ethnographic project on urban public space, I shot a film, Writing in Water (2011, 42 min) on the social life of calligraphy. I have co-curated with Zhang Zhen (of Cinema Studies) since 2006, Reel China @NYU, a Documentary Biennial ; the next one will be October 2012.

Current News/Projects Updated January 2014 My current ethnographic project is tentatively entitled \u201cSeeking Significance: Finding yourself in public in Beijing.\u201d\u2028 I am interested in how people transmute time \u201cspent\u201d into forms of social and personal value while simultaneously creating public space as they take up new activities together. In this way I hope to conjoin some newly emergent senses of the individual with equally new senses of the possibilities of being together with others. The question of access to the means of cultural production in public is a fascinating one in flux right now in this post-reform era. Various collaborations over the past few years have explored the production of art by local citizens in public spaces. They include a neighborhood photography installation, a performance piece about stiletto shoes and feminine beauty with a fashion house and my work with a community of students studying calligraphy with two teachers in a public park, writing in water on pavement using large sponge-tipped brushes. This beautiful disappearing Writing in Water (2012, 42 min) is the subject of my documentary, which has been screened at several universities in the past year and went to the 9th Beijing Independent Film Festival in August 2012. The Beijing fieldwork places the body and its mediations at the center of its theoretical commitments, continuing this theme as the grounding of my intellectual life. For more on this research and for my papers, visit my website at http://www.angelazito.com/ Another aspect of public cultural life that I have been researching is Chinese independent documentary film. I have been serving on festival juries (May 2009 at the 7th Independent Documentary Film Festival in Beijing; October 2011 at the 8th China Independent Film Festival in Nanjing) in an era of the contraction of public expression. Our work \u201coffshore\u201d to provide exhibition of these films\u2014in collaboration with Chinese friends--continued with October 2012's Reel China@NYU 6th Independent Film Biennial, which I co-curate with Professor Zhang Zhen of Cinema Studies. http://www.crmnyu.org/projects/reel-china/ Professor Zhang and I teach regularly a graduate seminar in \u201cNew Chinese Documentary Film.\u201d The festival provides opportunities for our students to see new work and meet filmmakers from China as well. Our co-edited collection of essays on Chinese independent documentary's digital entitled \"DV-Made China: Digital Subjects and Social Transformation\" is under review.    As Director of Religious Studies, I have been working to create a location for studying religion and social life in a world drawn together in new ways through global capital and media networks. http://religiousstudies.fas.nyu.edu/page/home . I continue to co-direct (with Faye Ginsburg) the Center for Religion and Media at NYU\u2014visit our website to find our Spring 2013 programming. http://www.crmnyu.org/ In September 2011, we inaugurated a new theme: \u201cDigital Religion: Knowledge, Politics and Practice\u201d thanks to a two-year grant from the Henry R. Luce Foundation. This grant funded a special channel at \u201cThe Revealer\u201d , the center\u2019s web magazine, called \u201cIn the World,\u201d http://therevealer.org/ which is dedicated to religion and media issues outside (but not out of reach of) the U.S. We held a third international conference on the theme in September 2013. \"RELIGION IN THE DIGITAL AGE II: Meditating 'The Human' in a Globalizing Asia\" http://www.crmnyu.org/event/religion-in-the-digital-age-2013/    As a member of the Anthropology Department, I encourage students interested in religion to join me and my colleagues in Religious Studies for either an undergraduate course or the graduate seminar, \u201cTheories and Methods for the Study of Religion,\u201d which I teach nearly every fall. We all look forward to another year of exciting public programming at the Center, lectures in our department and, of course, teaching and research!\u2028     Update your faculty profile                           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "New York University Study Away, College of Arts and Science Bulletin | NYU                                                  Navigation       College of Arts and Science Bulletin                 About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty             Home &gt; New York University Study Away         New York University Study Away        A  College of Arts and Science student with a GPA of 3.0 or higher may apply to  study away for one semester or a full academic year at an NYU global academic  center or through the international exchange program. Choosing to study away is  a simple process designed to help students understand their options and make  sure that the courses fit well into their overall academic plan. The NYU global  academic centers offer NYU courses in NYU-managed academic facilities, a  full-time staff, faculty hired locally and appointed by a committee in New  York, and guaranteed student housing assignments. The international exchange  program allows students to enroll directly at an approved exchange partner  university while remaining as an NYU student paying NYU tuition and retaining  the same NYU financial aid award.          First,  students should contact the Office of Global Programs (212-998-4433; www.nyu.edu/studyaway ) for information  on all study away options.          Second,  they should consult their academic adviser in the College Advising Center  (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130), or, if  they have already declared a major, their department, for more detailed and  customized advice and approval of a specific course of study.
