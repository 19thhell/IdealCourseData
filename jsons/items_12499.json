New York University has partnered with the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) to give students the option of ordering an electronic transcript online. Students and Alumni can order a secure PDF version of their official transcript to be sent to themselves or others.    AMCAS & LSAC Transcripts: Electronic transcripts are accepted by the American Medical College Application Service and Law School Admission Council.    Restrictions   When requesting paper or electronic transcripts:       Students matriculated at NYU Graduate Stern School of Business or NYU School of Medicine must contact their school's record office directly    Academic records prior to 1990 will not be available on electronic transcripts, students must request a paper transcript    Transcripts cannot be produced for anyone whose record has been put on hold for an outstanding University obligation    Special handling requests such as the inclusion of additional documents with transcript will not be possible with electronic transcript delivery      Cost and Order Requirements   The electronic transcript request order is handled by NSC and costs up to $3.25 for each transcript recipient specified on the order. Several universities have signed up for NSC's Electronic Transcript Exchange (ETX) service. Transcript delivery to these universities has a reduced cost of $2.25 and does not require requesters to provide any recipient email address. NSC currently accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover credit/debit cards for payment. Requesters will only be charged for the order payment when the transcript has been generated.    Order Process   Current and former students who attended NYU after 2001 can start the order process from Albert. The Request official transcript link can be found under the My Academics section of Student Center. When ordering from Albert, a signed consent form is not required. Other former students can order directly from NSC .   Once an order has been placed, requesters will receive two confirmation emails from NSC that confirm the receipt of the order and consent form. Another email will be sent when the transcript has been generated and sent to the recipient(s). For recipients that are not part of NSC's ETX service, two emails are sent that provide the user name and password needed to retrieve the secure PDF transcript. Once the recipient downloads the transcript, a notification email is sent.   All recipients have 30 days to retrieve transcripts. Requesters will receive periodic notifications for each recipient that has not retrieved their transcript.    Tip: Before you complete your request, check to ensure that all your grades have been posted. If you are a recent graduate, also check to ensure that your degree has been posted. You can view all posted grades and ensure that your degree has been recorded by viewing your unofficial transcript .

New York University has partnered with the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) to give students the option of ordering an electronic transcript online. Students and Alumni can order a secure PDF version of their official transcript to be sent to themselves or others.    AMCAS & LSAC Transcripts: Electronic transcripts are accepted by the American Medical College Application Service and Law School Admission Council.    Restrictions   When requesting paper or electronic transcripts:       Students matriculated at NYU Graduate Stern School of Business or NYU School of Medicine must contact their school's record office directly    Academic records prior to 1990 will not be available on electronic transcripts, students must request a paper transcript    Transcripts cannot be produced for anyone whose record has been put on hold for an outstanding University obligation    Special handling requests such as the inclusion of additional documents with transcript will not be possible with electronic transcript delivery      Cost and Order Requirements   The electronic transcript request order is handled by NSC and costs up to $3.25 for each transcript recipient specified on the order. Several universities have signed up for NSC's Electronic Transcript Exchange (ETX) service. Transcript delivery to these universities has a reduced cost of $2.25 and does not require requesters to provide any recipient email address. NSC currently accepts Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover credit/debit cards for payment. Requesters will only be charged for the order payment when the transcript has been generated.    Order Process   Current and former students who attended NYU after 2001 can start the order process from Albert. The Request official transcript link can be found under the My Academics section of Student Center. When ordering from Albert, a signed consent form is not required. Other former students can order directly from NSC .   Once an order has been placed, requesters will receive two confirmation emails from NSC that confirm the receipt of the order and consent form. Another email will be sent when the transcript has been generated and sent to the recipient(s). For recipients that are not part of NSC's ETX service, two emails are sent that provide the user name and password needed to retrieve the secure PDF transcript. Once the recipient downloads the transcript, a notification email is sent.   All recipients have 30 days to retrieve transcripts. Requesters will receive periodic notifications for each recipient that has not retrieved their transcript.    Tip: Before you complete your request, check to ensure that all your grades have been posted. If you are a recent graduate, also check to ensure that your degree has been posted.
