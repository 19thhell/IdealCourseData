The seminar will focus on the literary representation of the most pressing issue at the heart of Israel\u2019s existence -- the diverging attitudes toward the concepts of peace and war, or to conflict-resolution through the exercise of violence more generally. The corpus will include major works in Israeli literature \u2013 mostly fiction but some film and poetry as well \u2013 from its inception in pre-state Palestine to the present. Issues to be raised: Do literary representations reflect historical realities or do they constructthem? What role do sex/gender differences play in shaping the division between pacifists and their opponents? How does trauma \u2013 both personal and collective, past and present \u2013 impact the adherence to one position or another? What psycho-political circumstances have determined the glorification of military heroism and its decline? Finally, what does religion have to do with all this? Readings include: prose by S. Y. Agnon, S. Yizhar, Moshe Shamir, Shulamit Hareven, G. Shoham, A.B Yehoshua, Amos Oz, David Grossman, Ron Leshem; poetry by Yitzhak Lamdan, Haim Guri, Yehuda Amichai, Daliah Rvikovitch, Meir Wieselteir, Yizhak Laor; films on Lebanon War; critical studies related to the issues listed above.

The seminar will focus on the literary representation of the most pressing issue at the heart of Israel\u2019s existence -- the diverging attitudes toward the concepts of peace and war, or to conflict-resolution through the exercise of violence more generally. The corpus will include major works in Israeli literature \u2013 mostly fiction but some film and poetry as well \u2013 from its inception in pre-state Palestine to the present. Issues to be raised: Do literary representations reflect historical realities or do they constructthem? What role do sex/gender differences play in shaping the division between pacifists and their opponents? How does trauma \u2013 both personal and collective, past and present \u2013 impact the adherence to one position or another? What psycho-political circumstances have determined the glorification of military heroism and its decline? Finally, what does religion have to do with all this? Readings include: prose by S. Y. Agnon, S. Yizhar, Moshe Shamir, Shulamit Hareven, G. Shoham, A.B Yehoshua, Amos Oz, David Grossman, Ron Leshem; poetry by Yitzhak Lamdan, Haim Guri, Yehuda Amichai, Daliah Rvikovitch, Meir Wieselteir, Yizhak Laor; films on Lebanon War; critical studies related to the issues listed above.

This course is centrally concerned with the Roman Catholic Church, but the Shoah laid bare a mortal flaw of Christendom itself, certainly including Protestantism. Even in the hopeful era of Pope Francis, that flaw is not finished with. EURO-GA 2162 European Culture and the Decline of Religious Faith (Thursdays, 2:00pm\u20144:00pm, CEMS seminar room)  EURO-GA 2163 The Hapsburg Monarchy (Thursdays, 2:00pm\u20144:00pm, CEMS seminar room)  EURO-GA 2301 What is Europe? (Wednesdays 3:00 p.m\u20145:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) The   meaning of Europe has changed significantly over time. After the fall   of the Berlin Wall and the end of communism in Eastern Europe, the term   Europe mainly refers to the European Union, even though several European   states are not a member of the EU. This course will focus on the   post-WWII era to explore the changing meaning of Europe and the   formation of the EU. As a major actor in Europe today, the European   Union is influencing policies and shaping policy choices in member   states on a broad range of topics. We will study major concepts of   EU-integration, explore the institutions and policies of the EU and   discuss the role of citizens\u00b4 participation and euroscepticism. Why do   states transfer sovereignty to the EU? What is the role of nation-states   today and to what extent can they influence EU-politics? How do   citizens view the EU and what is their influence on the politics and   policies on the European level? Is crisis management and regulation   sufficient, or does the EU need a stronger basis of legitimacy? These   are some of the questions we will address in this seminar. At the end of   the semester, students will not only be familiar with key concepts of   European integration and governance in the EU, such as economic   governance and security policies. They will also have a tool kit for a   critical analysis of EU-policies and the key challenges Europe is facing   today, such as increasing immigration, economic disparities, and common   foreign policy. EURO-GA 2660 The Mediterranean in Historical Perspective (Thursdays, 10:00am\u201412:00pm, CEMS seminar room) This course focuses on Mediterranean European countries with an authoritarian tradition: Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Spain. It adopts a cross-national analysis of these countries throughout the 20th century and deals with several repressive state policies, such as propaganda and censorship and their effects. The course analyzes the ideology and tactics that were adopted in order to enforce ultra-conservative ideological agendas against the backdrop of economic crises, political instability and social insurrection. Questions that will be dealt with include the role of the Army in politics, the connections between authoritarian ideologies an violence, the regimes' inner transformations, the role of charismatic personalities such as Mussolini, France, Salazar, and Metaxas, and similarities and differences with totalitarian systems, such as Nazi Germany. A later part of the course focuses on issues such as cultural resistances, torture, but also the fictional representation of the regimes in literature and film. Spring 2015 EURO-GA 2670 A Modern Mediterranean Region (Thursdays, 3:00p.m\u20145:00pm, CEMS seminar room) From   the time of Fernand Braudel\u2019s magnum opus La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e et le Monde   M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en \u00e0 l'Epoque de Philippe II (1949) the Mediterranean has   been reconfigured extensively not only in political, economic and   cultural terms but also in the ways in which it is viewed, experienced   and conceptualized. This interdisciplinary course aspires to look at the   modern Mediterranean as a space of complexity, generating \u201cold\u201d style   conflicts \u2013 including genocide, ethnic cleansing, and riots \u2013 and \u201cnew\u201d   phenomena such as radical urban transformation, mass tourism, dynamic   social movements and hybrid identities. The course explores the region   in terms of both the scholarly (historical, anthropological) but also   the literary imagination in its wider facets (literary, cinematic) and   focuses on issues of memory and political uses of the past. The course   includes a theoretical component (on issues regarding nationalism,   orientalism, exoticism) and various case studies that cover both the   Eastern and Western Mediterranean, including divided cities (Jerusalem,   Beirut), cosmopolitan nostalgia (Istanbul, Salonica, Smyrna), the   decolonization of North Africa, the memory of Italian war crimes, the   Jewish and Armenian genocides, Spanish amnesia regarding Franco, and   Cypriot mass graves after 1974. EURO-GA 3000 Graduate Seminar (Wednesdays, 10:00am\u201412:00pm, CEMS seminar room) Required   for CEMS MA students. Not open to visiting students. This course   explores the design of research methodologies employed in the field of   European Studies. During the class we will cover various types of   empirical methods, focusing on qualitative ones, particularly   ethnography, historical research, visual analysis and digital media   analysis. We will look at different examples of how these methods can be   effectively used and combined for studying different aspects of   European societies, EU\u2019s political institutions, and cultural practices.   The course will emphasize the framing of research questions, the choice   of best methods for doing thesis research, and how methodological   approaches influence the significance, meaning, and impact of the   results. Assignments from this course are designed to help students   prepare for and advance their MA thesis projects. They will consist of   several relatively small projects as well as a larger research project   employing an original methodology. EURO-GA 3905 Topics in   European Politics: European Union in International Politics (Thursdays,   10:00am\u201412:00pm, CEMS seminar room) Since the Treaty of   Lisbon the European Union has a High Representative for Foreign Affairs   and Security Policy. Yet this institutional innovation cannot hide the   fact that the European Union has difficulties to find a common role in   international politics. In this course we will first analyze the   cultural, historical and political problems of European governance in a   field which is still very much governed by national sovereignty. Second,   we will look into case-studies of the European Union\u2019s actions in   international politics. These case-studies will include examples from   foreign and security policy, trade policy, and enlargement policy.   Third, we will discuss the conditions that would enable the European   Union to play a more effective and more democratically legitimized role   in international politics. EURO-GA 3213 Eastern Europe Workshop (Wednesdays, (generally twice per month), CEMS seminar room) The   Eastern Europe workshop is an informal 2-credit lunchtime workshop for   graduate students and advanced undergraduates meeting together to hear   speakers and discuss issues concerning Eastern Europe. EURO-GA 3900 Independent Study (self-scheduled) Permission of the department required EURO-GA 3902 Internship (self-scheduled) Students   can earn academic credit for a structured and supervised professional   work-learn experience within an approved organization. Permission of the   department required. Fall 2014 EURO-GA 2301 What is Europe? (Wednesdays 3:00 p.m\u20145:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) The meaning of Europe has changed significantly over time.

EURO-GA 2660 Mediterranean in Historical Perspective (Thursdays 12:00 p.m\u20142:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) This course focuses on Mediterranean European countries with an authoritarian tradition: Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain. It adopts a cross-national analysis of these countries throughout the 20th century and deals with several repressive state policies, such as torture, propaganda and censorship and their effects. The course analyzes the ideology and tactics that were adopted in order to enforce ultra-conservative ideological agendas against the backdrop of economic crises, political instability and social insurrection. The first part draws on a number of theoretical studies on the origins of fascism, and the various forms of authoritarianism and military regimes. A later part of the course analyzes the regimes\u2019 inner transformations. Questions that will be dealt with include the role of the Army in politics, the connections between authoritarian ideologies and violence, the role of charismatic personalities such as Mussolini, Franco, Salazar and Metaxas, and the similarities and differences with totalitarian systems, such as Nazi Germany. EURO-GA 2612 Topics: European Public Spheres (Tuesdays 10:00 a.m\u201412:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) The European Union has been so far very much a project of elites. In this seminar we will analyze the importance of discourses and conflicts in civil society for European democracy. We will not only investigate debates on Europe for example in political parties and NGOs, but also the actions of protest movements. The exchanges between the public spheres of Parliaments and of civil society will be addressed to. We will look to media coverage of European affairs and to discourses in cultural spheres like film and theater. On the basis of empirical knowledge about European public spheres, we will discuss proposals that could enhance the emergence of a European Public Sphere and thereby strengthen European Democracy. EURO-GA 3213 Eastern European Workshop (Wednesdays 12:30 p.m\u20142:00 p.m (generally twice per month), CEMS seminar room) The Eastern Europe workshop is an informal 2-credit lunchtime workshop for graduate students and advanced undergraduates meeting together to hear speakers and discuss issues concerning Eastern Europe. EURO-GA 3112 Sovereignty: 20th Century Ideas, Aesthetics, and Practices (Thursdays 4:55 p.m\u20147:35 p.m, location to be announced by History Department) This course proposes to re-examine the concept and predominant figures of sovereignty in the twentieth century, as these emerge not just in philosophical discussions but in histories of sovereignty and modernity, in political and legal arguments, and in aesthetic and epistemological discourses. Part of its basic thesis is that the problem and concept of sovereignty is frequently misunderstood as applied to the twentieth-century European world when it is understood as mostly a problem of politics, particularly of any politics in which democracy is at the heart of the question. The aesthetic forms and the epistemological grounds of a sovereignty radically transformed in and by the twentieth century, remain anemically engaged in most discussions. EURO-GA 3901 Sincerity and Authenticity in European Thought (Thursdays 2:00 p.m\u20144:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) The course will examine the emergence, in European thought, of the related ideals of sincerity and authenticity. We will investigate the ways in which they have shaped moral and political thought in Europe, particular through their roles in debates about identity, nationalism and multiculturalism. We will do so mainly through an examination of primary texts, ranging from philosophical and political texts to novels and poetry. Alongside these we will also read some of the contemporary literature on the significance of authenticity as an ideal. EURO-GA 3905 Topics in European Politics: the Welfare State in Europe and America (Mondays 4:00 p.m\u20146:00 p.m, CEMS seminar room) Charitable attempts to help the poor can be found throughout history, but the modern welfare state has sought not just to alleviate poverty but to assure citizens the right to a basic standard of living. It has, moreover, attempted to ensure protection for all citizens, not just the unfortunate, against a broad palette of natural and social risks. And in its most ambitious formulations, it has aimed to redistribute income and moderate economic and social inequalities. The welfare state has thus been an ambitious attempt to intervene in the market and assert society's control over the economy. Its beginnings in the late XIX century, its expansion in the XX century, and its current embattled condition have all therefore been accompanied by intense political controversy. This course will place the welfare state in its broad historical context, examining the radical break it represented, exploring the way in which it has differed among nations and assessing its current condition: victim of its own success or embattled ideal?
