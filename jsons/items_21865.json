In order to help participants prepare for the Conference, we will be hosting a series of presentation workshops, 2 for students doing panel presentations and 2 for students doing poster presentations.     These interactive workshops will focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of communicating research. Faculty from NYU's Writing in the Disciplines program will facilitate these sessions and fellow undergraduates with experience presenting at conferences will also be on hand to answer questions and provide insights from their own experience. Students attending the sessions are strongly encouraged to bring current drafts of their presentation to receive critique and guidance from fellow students and workshop facilitators.     All workshops will be held in Silver 907 from 5:30-7PM:     Workshops for Panel Presentations:     Wednesday, April 8th     Thursday, April 16th      Workshops for Poster Presentations     Thursday, April 9th     Wednesday, April 15th      2015 Conference Preview   Cindy Tsui (CAS \u201915) majoring in Computer Science, Pre-Med Long-Term Durability and Dose Escalation Patterns in Infliximab Therapy for Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease affecting 3% of the population. The prevailing reason for discontinuation of infliximab treatment for psoriasis is loss of clinical response, requiring dose intensification to optimize the treatment regimen. Furthermore, concomitant immunosuppressive medications, e.g. methotrexate, theoretically extend infliximab durability. Our research shows infliximab dose escalation to be well tolerated in our patient cohort and confirms that concurrent methotrexate is associated with significantly improved maintenance of clinical response. Our experience with intensified infliximab regimens supports the efficacy and safety of dose escalation in treating psoriasis.
