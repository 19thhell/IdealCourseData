At the heart of my work is an impulse to seek out both precise and hypothetical connections both between texts and between texts and non-textual artefacts, in an ongoing attempt to trace out how literature produces the spaces in which we live, our concrete and poetic habitats, as well as human ecologies and global imaginaries. My main interdisciplinary connections are thus with human/cultural/theoretical geography, art history, and (of late) environmental science. I have written on various topics, including the tension between religious and scientific cartographies, the proliferation of \"epic building sites\" that connect literature and other art forms, as well as on epic literature's \"mapping\" of local, national, and global spaces in the early-modern period. My two main projects at present are 1) a book on Montaigne as an author \"in the world\" and 2) a book about what I am calling the \"Humanist Anthropocene.\" In this latter project, I am seeking out connections between early-modern humanism and our 21st-century reality of living on a globalized planet that humans are influencing at a geological scale. I am also a translator. I look forward to working with graduate students on all topics related historically or theoretically to my work.
