Passionate about civic tech? Are you\u2026   A professional student in law, computer science, engineering, design, public policy, or business who wants to expand your toolkit for change?   A public servant who want to bring innovation to your job?   Someone with a really important idea for how to make the world better but who lacks key skills or resources to realize the vision?   Through coaching, rapid prototyping using agile, design thinking methods, collaboration and repeated presentation, you will develop project-related skills such as how to sharply define a problem, design for citizens, overcome legal barriers and pitch projects to risk-averse officials and politicians. In the process you will be joining a growing network of like-minded peers who also working with civic tech to address hard public problems. During the final demo day, you will pitch to friends and civic funders, including the Knight Foundation.   Solving Public Problems with Technology is a hands-on learning and mentoring program designed to help you design and implement solutions to public interest problems using civic technology. The course enables you to take advantage of the latest innovations in open and participatory problem-solving, including the application of open data, crowdsourcing, expert networks and systems, game mechanics, and prizes. Geared to the purpose-driven participant (both individuals and teams) passionate about a problem, Solving Public Problems helps you develop a project from idea to implementation. The program focuses exclusively on the public interest and on projects that work with real world institutions and partners, such as agencies and NGOs, to develop more effective and scalable initiatives.
