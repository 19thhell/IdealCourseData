Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Students cap their language achievement by accessing and studying such genres as literature, song, film, folklore, etc., in the original language. The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

In this course we trace the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day, drawing on primary sources and secondary readings from religious studies, the history of science, and anthropology.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course will invite students to explore the legal systems of other than their own native legal system. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic and Sharia. The class will also examine the diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines, successfully used by billions of people in various parts of the world. This course will pay special attention to law traditions explicitly functioning in United States of America, and United Arab Emirates. This class will offer a historical and cultural background related to the development of legal structures and substantive rules in both territories. Students will study existing judicial systems, and essential rules dealing with legal education and practice in U.S. and Emirates.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

POLSC-AD 152X Comparative Politics of the Middle East                                                                                         A focus on the &quot;Arab Middle East&quot; presupposes that regional culture is a significant factor in explaining political outcomes in the region. For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

POLSC-AD 159X Public Policy Challenges in the Middle East                                                                                         Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

VISAR-AD 103X Introduction to Visual Culture                                                                                         Visual Culture Studies branches away from the traditional preoccupations of Art History towards new subjects and methodologies. It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 131X A &amp; E ll: Contemporary Debates about the Middle East and Islamic World                                                        It is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration to suggest that there exists no other region or cultural grouping in the world today that has undergone such intense scrutiny as that of Middle East and Islamic world. With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

Arab Crossroads Major                       Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                                          Arab Crossroads Concentration                       This multidisciplinary concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

In recent years, Arabic language students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.

The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Students cap their language achievement by accessing and studying such genres as literature, song, film, folklore, etc., in the original language. The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course will invite students to explore the legal systems of other than their own native legal system. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic and Sharia. The class will also examine the diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines, successfully used by billions of people in various parts of the world. This course will pay special attention to law traditions explicitly functioning in United States of America, and United Arab Emirates.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. They design and execute a public opinion survey of U.S. and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other&mdash;using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life.

But in the Middle East states and national cultures are at the same time ancient and recently created. Here the complex processes of state-formation are still current, and the United Arab Emirates, which is barely forty years old, serves a rich and richly varied example for the comparative understanding of state-building, cultural imagination, and economic development.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

Arab Crossroads Major                       Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                                          Arab Crossroads Concentration                       This multidisciplinary concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

In recent years, Arabic language students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

principal means through which humans communicate and a major vehicle in the development of thought, culture, and aesthetic expression. Studying language makes one aware of other conceptual and cultural worlds and enables one to reach more effectively into those worlds and bridge cultures. NYU Abu Dhabi language courses are structured to increase competency at every level in speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills. Every language course introduces cultural material that highlights the connectedness of language, culture, and thought.   Many of our students are multilingual; English is a second, if not a third language. All graduate from NYUAD with a mastery of English. Our program emphasizes sophistication not just in writing, but in all aspects of communication. We recognize the close connection between culture and language: the cultural background of students influences their style of expression and class participation, and we work with them to thrive in the interactive approach to learning at NYUAD. The foundation course is Analysis and Expression, which develops critical thinking in tandem with written and verbal expression. Students seeking further support, whether to refine their writing skills, enhance their verbal fluency, or improve their articulation and accent, will find it at the Academic Resource Center, where instructors are trained in English as a second language. Periodic language assessments monitor the progress of students to assure they are on track to reach the goal of advanced proficiency in English.   Students are strongly encouraged to study a language other than English while at NYUAD. Language study opens a window into other cultures and ways of conceiving the world. Students who choose to acquire a new language or to pursue advanced study of a language with which they are already familiar, are better poised to realize their potential as 21st-century global citizens. Languages offered at NYUAD through regular coursework are Arabic and Chinese. Students are strongly encouraged to study Arabic, which is the first language of Abu Dhabi. Classroom learning is enhanced by opportunities to apply language skills in the community and to travel to other Arabic-speaking countries in the region. Students of Chinese are strongly encouraged to spend at least a semester at NYU's program in Shanghai and to attend NYU's summer Chinese language program in Beijing .     Students who wish to advance their proficiency in languages other than Arabic and Chinese may take advantage of the immersive language instruction offered at NYU's global sites in Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Paris, Tel Aviv, and Prague. With their mentor's approval, students may petition to study other languages offered at NYU New York through special tutorial arrangements.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 1 the student will perfect their knowledge of the Arabic writing/reading system; will learn how to produce accurate and coherent sentences in Arabic; and will utilize a variety of audio-visual material to begin to re-discover, debate, and express some of the key characteristics of Arab culture and identity.

Building on the students&#39; prior knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic, this course introduces the students to the unique aspects that make the Emirati dialect so lively and distinctive. From the heart of the ancient oasis of Al Ain where the course is taught, the course also serves as a gateway to accessing intimate aspects of life, culture, and heritage of the Gulf region. Using a bilingual textbook specifically designed by the course instructors to teach Emirati Arabic in formal and informal settings, students learn and experience the target dialect through direct instruction as well as through exploration of Emirati cultural life in folklore, song, film, art, and literature.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 2 the student will work to perfect their command of Arabic syntax; will learn to produce longer argumentative pieces; will begin to access, assess and taste some of Arabic&rsquo;s key modern literary and cultural products and will continue to debate, and explore various aspects of Arabic culture.

The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

This course is designed especially for those beginners who have no previous background in Chinese but would like to learn the language more intensively and more quickly. Unlike the regular Elementary Chinese I course which will teach ten chapters during one semester, this course will cover twenty chapters during the semester. The training that students get will be equal to one academic year of training, and after completing this course, students will be eligible to skip Elementary Chinese II and take Intermediate Chinese I directly.    The course will begin with introducing Pinyin, the phonetic system of Mandarin Chinese. After that, it will introduce radicals, some basic vocabulary, sentence structures, and grammar points. By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to read Chinese characters with correct tones; write characters in correct stroke order; compose short essays by using the vocabulary and grammar they have learned; understand by listening conversations about some easy topics; and handle certain informal topics that require an exchange of basic information related to study and leisure activities.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 130 Analysis and Expression II: Ideas of the Tragic                                             A man pokes his eyes out upon realizing he has killed his father and slept with his mother. A king returning from war finds his adulterous wife in a murdering mood, and before long he is dead. A wife betrayed by her philandering husband slaughters her two children as revenge. Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus&rsquo;s Agamemnon and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle&rsquo;s, Hegel&rsquo;s, and George Steiner&rsquo;s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan&rsquo;s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world. Possible topics range from online communities of mourning or the debate over how to commemorate the attacks and their consequences to the continuing influence of classical tragedy on contemporary culture in The Wire or Lars von Trier&rsquo;s Melancholia.

With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

WRIT-AD 210 Advanced Analysis and Expression                                             This course builds upon the skills from Analysis and Expression and the Writing-Intensive Core courses to prepare students for advanced writing across the curriculum. The course calls upon students to be creative, critical, and curious, as they rigorously practice their written and spoken expression. Students engage with a variety of texts and research topics to gain greater self-awareness and confidence with their writing. Each major assignment is the result of a progression of exercises with an emphasis on drafting and revision strategies. Students work collaboratively, offering constructive critique through class discussion, peer workshops, and one-on-one conferences.   Please note: students who have not achieved a pass in the Writing Placement exam, or a pass of 'B' or better in WRIT-AD 110 or WRIT-AD 111X will be dropped from this class prior to the start of the Add/Drop period.

Arabic Language Program     NYU Abu Dhabi has a vibrant Arabic program and boasts numerous opportunities for linguistic and cultural immersion. In recent years, Arabic students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Students cap their language achievement by accessing and studying such genres as literature, song, film, folklore, etc., in the original language. The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

In this course we trace the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day, drawing on primary sources and secondary readings from religious studies, the history of science, and anthropology.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course will invite students to explore the legal systems of other than their own native legal system. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic and Sharia. The class will also examine the diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines, successfully used by billions of people in various parts of the world. This course will pay special attention to law traditions explicitly functioning in United States of America, and United Arab Emirates. This class will offer a historical and cultural background related to the development of legal structures and substantive rules in both territories. Students will study existing judicial systems, and essential rules dealing with legal education and practice in U.S. and Emirates.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

POLSC-AD 152X Comparative Politics of the Middle East                                                                                         A focus on the &quot;Arab Middle East&quot; presupposes that regional culture is a significant factor in explaining political outcomes in the region. For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

POLSC-AD 159X Public Policy Challenges in the Middle East                                                                                         Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

VISAR-AD 103X Introduction to Visual Culture                                                                                         Visual Culture Studies branches away from the traditional preoccupations of Art History towards new subjects and methodologies. It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 131X A &amp; E ll: Contemporary Debates about the Middle East and Islamic World                                                        It is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration to suggest that there exists no other region or cultural grouping in the world today that has undergone such intense scrutiny as that of Middle East and Islamic world. With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

Arab Crossroads Major                       Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                                          Arab Crossroads Concentration                       This multidisciplinary concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

In recent years, Arabic language students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

principal means through which humans communicate and a major vehicle in the development of thought, culture, and aesthetic expression. Studying language makes one aware of other conceptual and cultural worlds and enables one to reach more effectively into those worlds and bridge cultures. NYU Abu Dhabi language courses are structured to increase competency at every level in speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills. Every language course introduces cultural material that highlights the connectedness of language, culture, and thought.   Many of our students are multilingual; English is a second, if not a third language. All graduate from NYUAD with a mastery of English. Our program emphasizes sophistication not just in writing, but in all aspects of communication. We recognize the close connection between culture and language: the cultural background of students influences their style of expression and class participation, and we work with them to thrive in the interactive approach to learning at NYUAD. The foundation course is Analysis and Expression, which develops critical thinking in tandem with written and verbal expression. Students seeking further support, whether to refine their writing skills, enhance their verbal fluency, or improve their articulation and accent, will find it at the Academic Resource Center, where instructors are trained in English as a second language. Periodic language assessments monitor the progress of students to assure they are on track to reach the goal of advanced proficiency in English.   Students are strongly encouraged to study a language other than English while at NYUAD. Language study opens a window into other cultures and ways of conceiving the world. Students who choose to acquire a new language or to pursue advanced study of a language with which they are already familiar, are better poised to realize their potential as 21st-century global citizens. Languages offered at NYUAD through regular coursework are Arabic and Chinese. Students are strongly encouraged to study Arabic, which is the first language of Abu Dhabi. Classroom learning is enhanced by opportunities to apply language skills in the community and to travel to other Arabic-speaking countries in the region. Students of Chinese are strongly encouraged to spend at least a semester at NYU's program in Shanghai and to attend NYU's summer Chinese language program in Beijing .     Students who wish to advance their proficiency in languages other than Arabic and Chinese may take advantage of the immersive language instruction offered at NYU's global sites in Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Paris, Tel Aviv, and Prague. With their mentor's approval, students may petition to study other languages offered at NYU New York through special tutorial arrangements.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 1 the student will perfect their knowledge of the Arabic writing/reading system; will learn how to produce accurate and coherent sentences in Arabic; and will utilize a variety of audio-visual material to begin to re-discover, debate, and express some of the key characteristics of Arab culture and identity.

Building on the students&#39; prior knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic, this course introduces the students to the unique aspects that make the Emirati dialect so lively and distinctive. From the heart of the ancient oasis of Al Ain where the course is taught, the course also serves as a gateway to accessing intimate aspects of life, culture, and heritage of the Gulf region. Using a bilingual textbook specifically designed by the course instructors to teach Emirati Arabic in formal and informal settings, students learn and experience the target dialect through direct instruction as well as through exploration of Emirati cultural life in folklore, song, film, art, and literature.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 2 the student will work to perfect their command of Arabic syntax; will learn to produce longer argumentative pieces; will begin to access, assess and taste some of Arabic&rsquo;s key modern literary and cultural products and will continue to debate, and explore various aspects of Arabic culture.

The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

This course is designed especially for those beginners who have no previous background in Chinese but would like to learn the language more intensively and more quickly. Unlike the regular Elementary Chinese I course which will teach ten chapters during one semester, this course will cover twenty chapters during the semester. The training that students get will be equal to one academic year of training, and after completing this course, students will be eligible to skip Elementary Chinese II and take Intermediate Chinese I directly.    The course will begin with introducing Pinyin, the phonetic system of Mandarin Chinese. After that, it will introduce radicals, some basic vocabulary, sentence structures, and grammar points. By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to read Chinese characters with correct tones; write characters in correct stroke order; compose short essays by using the vocabulary and grammar they have learned; understand by listening conversations about some easy topics; and handle certain informal topics that require an exchange of basic information related to study and leisure activities.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 130 Analysis and Expression II: Ideas of the Tragic                                             A man pokes his eyes out upon realizing he has killed his father and slept with his mother. A king returning from war finds his adulterous wife in a murdering mood, and before long he is dead. A wife betrayed by her philandering husband slaughters her two children as revenge. Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus&rsquo;s Agamemnon and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle&rsquo;s, Hegel&rsquo;s, and George Steiner&rsquo;s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan&rsquo;s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world. Possible topics range from online communities of mourning or the debate over how to commemorate the attacks and their consequences to the continuing influence of classical tragedy on contemporary culture in The Wire or Lars von Trier&rsquo;s Melancholia.

With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

WRIT-AD 210 Advanced Analysis and Expression                                             This course builds upon the skills from Analysis and Expression and the Writing-Intensive Core courses to prepare students for advanced writing across the curriculum. The course calls upon students to be creative, critical, and curious, as they rigorously practice their written and spoken expression. Students engage with a variety of texts and research topics to gain greater self-awareness and confidence with their writing. Each major assignment is the result of a progression of exercises with an emphasis on drafting and revision strategies. Students work collaboratively, offering constructive critique through class discussion, peer workshops, and one-on-one conferences.   Please note: students who have not achieved a pass in the Writing Placement exam, or a pass of 'B' or better in WRIT-AD 110 or WRIT-AD 111X will be dropped from this class prior to the start of the Add/Drop period.

Arabic Language Program     NYU Abu Dhabi has a vibrant Arabic program and boasts numerous opportunities for linguistic and cultural immersion. In recent years, Arabic students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.

vehicle in the development of thought, culture, and aesthetic expression. Studying language makes one aware of other conceptual and cultural worlds and enables one to reach more effectively into those worlds and bridge cultures. NYU Abu Dhabi language courses are structured to increase competency at every level in speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills. Every language course introduces cultural material that highlights the connectedness of language, culture, and thought.   Many of our students are multilingual; English is a second, if not a third language. All graduate from NYUAD with a mastery of English. Our program emphasizes sophistication not just in writing, but in all aspects of communication. We recognize the close connection between culture and language: the cultural background of students influences their style of expression and class participation, and we work with them to thrive in the interactive approach to learning at NYUAD. The foundation course is Analysis and Expression, which develops critical thinking in tandem with written and verbal expression. Students seeking further support, whether to refine their writing skills, enhance their verbal fluency, or improve their articulation and accent, will find it at the Academic Resource Center, where instructors are trained in English as a second language. Periodic language assessments monitor the progress of students to assure they are on track to reach the goal of advanced proficiency in English.   Students are strongly encouraged to study a language other than English while at NYUAD. Language study opens a window into other cultures and ways of conceiving the world. Students who choose to acquire a new language or to pursue advanced study of a language with which they are already familiar, are better poised to realize their potential as 21st-century global citizens. Languages offered at NYUAD through regular coursework are Arabic and Chinese. Students are strongly encouraged to study Arabic, which is the first language of Abu Dhabi. Classroom learning is enhanced by opportunities to apply language skills in the community and to travel to other Arabic-speaking countries in the region. Students of Chinese are strongly encouraged to spend at least a semester at NYU's program in Shanghai and to attend NYU's summer Chinese language program in Beijing .     Students who wish to advance their proficiency in languages other than Arabic and Chinese may take advantage of the immersive language instruction offered at NYU's global sites in Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Paris, Tel Aviv, and Prague. With their mentor's approval, students may petition to study other languages offered at NYU New York through special tutorial arrangements.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 1 the student will perfect their knowledge of the Arabic writing/reading system; will learn how to produce accurate and coherent sentences in Arabic; and will utilize a variety of audio-visual material to begin to re-discover, debate, and express some of the key characteristics of Arab culture and identity.

Building on the students&#39; prior knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic, this course introduces the students to the unique aspects that make the Emirati dialect so lively and distinctive. From the heart of the ancient oasis of Al Ain where the course is taught, the course also serves as a gateway to accessing intimate aspects of life, culture, and heritage of the Gulf region. Using a bilingual textbook specifically designed by the course instructors to teach Emirati Arabic in formal and informal settings, students learn and experience the target dialect through direct instruction as well as through exploration of Emirati cultural life in folklore, song, film, art, and literature.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 2 the student will work to perfect their command of Arabic syntax; will learn to produce longer argumentative pieces; will begin to access, assess and taste some of Arabic&rsquo;s key modern literary and cultural products and will continue to debate, and explore various aspects of Arabic culture.

The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

This course is designed especially for those beginners who have no previous background in Chinese but would like to learn the language more intensively and more quickly. Unlike the regular Elementary Chinese I course which will teach ten chapters during one semester, this course will cover twenty chapters during the semester. The training that students get will be equal to one academic year of training, and after completing this course, students will be eligible to skip Elementary Chinese II and take Intermediate Chinese I directly.    The course will begin with introducing Pinyin, the phonetic system of Mandarin Chinese. After that, it will introduce radicals, some basic vocabulary, sentence structures, and grammar points. By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to read Chinese characters with correct tones; write characters in correct stroke order; compose short essays by using the vocabulary and grammar they have learned; understand by listening conversations about some easy topics; and handle certain informal topics that require an exchange of basic information related to study and leisure activities.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 130 Analysis and Expression II: Ideas of the Tragic                                             A man pokes his eyes out upon realizing he has killed his father and slept with his mother. A king returning from war finds his adulterous wife in a murdering mood, and before long he is dead. A wife betrayed by her philandering husband slaughters her two children as revenge. Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus&rsquo;s Agamemnon and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle&rsquo;s, Hegel&rsquo;s, and George Steiner&rsquo;s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan&rsquo;s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world. Possible topics range from online communities of mourning or the debate over how to commemorate the attacks and their consequences to the continuing influence of classical tragedy on contemporary culture in The Wire or Lars von Trier&rsquo;s Melancholia.

With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

WRIT-AD 210 Advanced Analysis and Expression                                             This course builds upon the skills from Analysis and Expression and the Writing-Intensive Core courses to prepare students for advanced writing across the curriculum. The course calls upon students to be creative, critical, and curious, as they rigorously practice their written and spoken expression. Students engage with a variety of texts and research topics to gain greater self-awareness and confidence with their writing. Each major assignment is the result of a progression of exercises with an emphasis on drafting and revision strategies. Students work collaboratively, offering constructive critique through class discussion, peer workshops, and one-on-one conferences.   Please note: students who have not achieved a pass in the Writing Placement exam, or a pass of 'B' or better in WRIT-AD 110 or WRIT-AD 111X will be dropped from this class prior to the start of the Add/Drop period.
