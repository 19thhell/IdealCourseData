These programs encompass the following degrees: Ph.D. in Middle Eastern    Studies (Dept. of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies), Ph.D. in History and Middle Eastern    Studies (joint degree of the Dept. of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies and the History    Dept.), M.A. and Ph.D. in Hebrew and Judaic Studies, M.A. in Near Eastern    Studies (offered through the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies),    M.A. in Near Eastern Studies and Journalism (KCNES), M.A. in Near Eastern    Studies with a concentration in Museum Studies (KCNES), and M.A. in Near    Eastern Studies with a Business Option (KCNES and the Graduate School    of Business). The Dept. of Middle East and Islamic Studies and Skirball Dept. of Hebrew    and Judaic Studies also offer majors and minors for the B.A. degree. The    Program in Near Eastern Studies is interdisciplinary, drawing its faculty    from a number of FAS and GSAS departments. Consequently, the collection    also supports research and curricular needs in the departments of Anthropology,    Economics, Sociology, Comparative Literature, Music, Cinema Studies, Fine    Arts, and Religious Studies.    Program emphases which affect this collection statement are the Middle    East since the rise of Islam, the Ancient Near East, and Biblical Studies.                 Scope        Language     Materials in modern and classical Arabic, Persian, Ottoman and modern     Turkish, and Biblical and modern Hebrew are collected most heavily.     Egyptian, Akkadian, Ugaritic, Assyrian, and Sumerian are acquired     actively, but selectively. Coptic, Pushtu, Urdu, other Iranian and     Turkic languages are collected very selectively. The Library does     not collect materials in Armenian and the languages of the Caucasus.     The Library also acquires very comprehensively materials in European     languages; in particular English, French, and German, and to a lesser     degree in Italian, Spanish, Russian, and other European languages.         Geographical Areas     Areas collected most intensively include all of North Africa and     the Middle East from Morocco through Afghanistan. Materials on or     from Central Asia, Muslim Europe, and the diaspora communities are     collected more selectively; those on or from Pakistan and Muslim India,     sub-Saharan Africa, and East Asia are acquired very selectively.         Chronological Periods and Subject Areas     The collection encompasses a broad chronological spectrum. For the     Ancient Near East, materials on the Syro-Palestinian region and Biblical     Studies are collected most heavily. Mesopotamia and Egypt are collected     more selectively. The Library is highly selective in the acquisition     of materials on other areas of the Ancient Near East. Emphasis is     on historical, linguistic, literary, and religious material. Archaeological     material is collected only if it encompasses these four areas.     For the classical and modern Middle East, the Library acquires materials     for all of the geographic areas detailed in IIB. Major emphasis is     on language, literature, history (including political and social history),     religion, culture, women's studies, and urbanism. Politics, sociology,     anthropology, economics, and the fine and performing arts are collected     somewhat more selectively, but actively.                        Types of Materials        Included     Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, proceedings,     facsimiles, reprints, government documents, microforms, audio-visual     and electronic media. Exhibition catalogs, maps, textbooks for language     instruction and dissertations are acquired very selectively.         Excluded     Manuscripts (except in very rare circumstances), textbooks, ephemera,     translations from other languages into Near Eastern languages.                        Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection    Strengths    In general, Bobst Library is strong in Arabic and Islamic reference sources,    classical and modern Arabic literature, and the history of the Middle    East. The collection is moderately strong in materials dealing with Biblical    Studies (excluding the New Testament) and the modern political and social    history of the Arab world and Iran.    The stacks collection includes approximately 4,000 books and journals    from the library of the late Islamic scholar Gaston Wiet. The materials    are in Arabic and Western languages and emphasize classical Arabic belle-lettres.    The stacks also contain the library of the Toumlilene Monastery of Azrou,    Morocco. It includes 2,000 books and journals in Arabic and Western languages    with an emphasis on North Africa. Other important collections of smaller    dimensions, housed in the general stacks, include the following: parts    of the libraries of the Egyptian writer and publisher Muhammad Mas'ud,    Islamic numismatist George C. Miles, Islamic art historian Richard Ettinghausen,    Aramco, and Mobil Oil.    In addition, Bobst Special Collections contain the Hewitt collection    of approximately 300 volumes in Ottoman Turkish which was a gift of the    last Ottoman sultan, Abd al-Hamid II. The stacks collection is actively    expanded through a current acquisitions program which encompasses extensive    approval and blanket order plans for the U.S., Europe, the Arab World,    Iran, Israel, and Turkey; as well as current and retrospective purchase    of individual titles.    Weaknesses    Following are areas and types of materials in need of additional attention    for the acquisition of materials:        Research and Curricular Emphases          Turkish Studies      Islamic Law             Serials     Although the Library owns almost all of the major periodicals in     the field, particularly in European and Arabic languages, there are     additional titles covered by indexing sources, which the Library needs     to acquire.         Electronic Resources     Although previously there has not been much published in electronic     format in Middle East Studies, there are current and forthcoming titles     which we need to acquire.         Document Collections     The Library needs to acquire primary resource collections which have     been issued in microform or in reprint, such as the Ottoman provincial     and ministry yearbooks, and the Records series published by Archive     Editions.         Preservation Issues     Many of the items in the Wiet and Toumlilene collections have serious     preservation problems and will need to be replaced by filming or purchase.                        Other Resources        Other NYU Collections     The Library of the Institute of Fine Arts is strong in materials dealing     with Islamic and other Middle Eastern art and architecture; the art     and archaeology of the ancient Near East, particularly Egyptology.     The Law School Library is strong in constitutional law materials from     the Arab world and Israel.     The Ettinghausen Library in the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies     is actually an extension of the Bobst collection. Its collection consists     of reference materials which duplicate resources available in Bobst.        Other Area Libraries     Princeton and NYU are a joint National Resource Center in Middle     East Studies. Princeton libraries are a major resource for Middle     Eastern materials and are strong in manuscripts and printed texts     in Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, and Turkish. Subjects emphasized are:     Islam, Judaism, classical and modern Middle Eastern culture, history,     language, and literature.     Columbia University Libraries (Butler and Lehmann) also have a strong     Middle East collection. The collection is an area resource in Turkish,     Armenian, and Georgian materials.     The New York Public Library, through its general collection and the     Oriental Division and the Map Division, is a strong resource for filling     Bobst gaps in Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew language materials, Near     East travel literature, Near Eastern Christianity, and Islam. The     NYPL is an area resource for newspapers of the Middle East and diaspora     communities.                        Subject &amp; Collection Levels    Forthcoming.
