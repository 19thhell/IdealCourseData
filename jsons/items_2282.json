In this class our aim is to read a range of difficult texts from both antiquity and modernity slowly and carefully, examining closely a series of important philosophical conjunctions. By examining these scenes of reception, both the ancient text and the modern shed light upon one another \u2013why do certain ancient texts come to illustrate and illuminate modern philosophy, and how do modern concerns come to re-animate the ancient texts? The conjunctions will include Sophocles\u2019 Antigone and Hegel; Presocratic philosophy and Nietzsche; Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Tyrannos and Freud; Plato\u2019s Phaedrus and Derrida; Plato\u2019s Republic and Irigaray; Antigone and Judith Butler. This class recommended for students with some experience with theory and continental philosophy who wish to deepen their understanding of these difficult thinkers. Topics: Lyric Subjectivity and Transculturation Duffy This course will explore the development of lyric poetry from the troubadours to the European metaphysicals, exploring imitation, competition, and anxiety as driving forces of lyric production within a transcultural framework. Primary Texts will include works by Arnaut Daniel, Dante, Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, Garcilaso de la Vega, Lu\u00eds Vas de Cam\u00f5es, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, Jan Van der Noot, Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, Jean de Sponde, Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Herrera, Giambattista Marino, George Herbert, and Richard Crashaw. Critical works will include those by Thomas Greene, Leonard Forster, Teodolinda Barolini, Roland Greene, Terence Cave, Maria Rosa Menocal, Ignacio Navarette, Mario Praz, Gilles Deleuze, Heather DuBrow, and others.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Enlightenment Evil Gadberry This semester, we will investigate a series of attempts to justify the existence of evil in the world \u2013 and in us. As we read poems, novels, letters, and works of philosophy of the long eighteenth century, we will study the complaints hurled at an incomprehensibly unjust universe in a moment known for its confidence in the powers of the understanding. Our inquiry will take us from texts that try to justify a system that makes us rotten from the very beginning, to works that suggest we live in the best of possible worlds, to scathing satires of these defenses, and \u2013 most scandalously of all \u2013 to outright celebrations of wickedness. We will look at the impersonal evil of natural calamities (in the writings that emerged around the devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755) to the carefully wrought cruelties of sadism (in the Marquis deSade\u2019s Justine, for instance). As we do so, we\u2019ll think about how Enlightenment reason grapples with problems that seem to resist reason, how Enlightenment optimism stands up to critique, and how some instrumentalize (and even eroticize!) reason in pursuit of amoral pleasures. Required works will include the following primary works, many of which will be available in a coursepack: Kant, \u201cOn the Miscarriage of All Philosophical Trials in Theodicy\u201d; Kleist, \u201cThe Earthquake in Chile\u201d; Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons; Leibniz, Theodicy (selections); John Milton, Paradise Lost (selections); Pope, \u201cAn Essay on Man\u201d; Rousseau, letter to Voltaire defending Pope and Leibniz and selections from the Confessions and Social Contract; Sade, Justine; Voltaire, Candide and \u201cPoem on the Lisbon Disaster.\u201d The coursepack will also include secondary readings by Bakunin, Foucault, Lacan, and others.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Cosmopolitanism and Urban Spaces Halim The notion of cosmopolitanism has been associated, traditionally, with the city, the cosmopolite being conceived of as a privileged urbanite. Although much has changed in the way we have come to think of cosmopolitanism in recent years, we still need to ask: to what extent is everyone potentially a cosmopolite nowadays? Are there good and bad candidates for that status, and if so, what are the criteria, and who gets to decide? Are all the world\u2019s cities global cities? And what of \u201cvillage\u201d in \u201cglobal village\u201d? If we bear in mind that a substantial portion of the world\u2019s population still lives in relatively deprived semi-rural areas, how would that alter our understanding of this new cosmopolitanism, or propose other forms? In what way does the city-bred cosmopolite\u2019s thirst for pastoral images and idyllic vistas impact peasants and the countryside? What, if any, are the tactics to which rural migrants in big urban centers resort to rework old patterns of belonging and forge new attachments? In this course, we will attend to these and other questions of cosmopolitanism and globalization in rural and urban spaces through theory, literary texts and films from the Middle East, Europe and the USA.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Violence and Technology Kaffen Frequently characterized as an aberration within modernity, pervasive violence in its various forms (war, terror, crime, culture) has proven disastrously resistant to the ideals of the enlightenment, throwing them into question if not crisis. More, its relationship to technology in particular remains among the most fraught legacies of modernity. Indeed, the intersections of technology and violence have engendered the most profound critical debates and contentious cultural and artistic works of the twentieth century. In the interest of grappling with the ever increasing complexity of this relationship, we will read a broad array of critical writings on violence and technology, as they intersect with questions of politics, security, and sovereignty. At the same time, we will pay attention to the cultural and artistic expressions that critically engage with these issues from literature, music, architecture, painting, photography, cinema, video games, and assorted new media. Readings will include Eyal Weizman, George Bataille, Paul Virilio, Sasaki Ataru, TJ Clark, Walter Benjamin, Adriana Caverero, Hannah Arendt, Carl von Clausewitz, Ariella Azoulay, Jean Genet, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt, George Didi- Huberman, W.G. Sebald, Ernst Junger.  Topics: Fascism/Violence/Memory: The Case of the Spanish Civil War Matos-Martin The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) is the defining event in Spanish modern history as well as widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those three years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of the course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice.  Topics in 19th Century History: Century Literary History: Arthur Rimbaud Ross A seminar devoted to the poetry, cultural, and political context of Arthur Rimbaud.   Students must have some reading knowledge of French (there will surely be differing   levels of familiarity with French in the group) and a good French dictionary. Discussion conducted in English.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards. Requirements: One 12-15 page paper and an oral presentation. Students who want to work on a comparative project that brings in film or visual media may do so with instructor's approval.    Introduction to Comp Lit: Necessary Fiction  Basterra We like to think of ourselves as acting freely, creating our own ideas and objects. In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Salinas, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?    Junior Theory Seminar: Philosophy of the Body Bianchi What is a body, and how has the body figured in the history of Western thought? How is the body constituted in relation to its others: mind/spirit/soul? How does the body appear as an object both natural and technological? How do bodies come to bear social and political significance: in relation to sex, gender, class, race, sexuality, and bodily ability among others? How are bodies fashioned and produced by personal and cultural practices? In this class we will address the devaluation of the body and somatophobia in the history of Western philosophy, and track the resurgence of the body in 20th and 21st century thought, including existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, race theory, queer theory, disability theory and \u201cnew materialisms.\u201d Lastly, we will examine critical analyses of bodily regimes and practices, which may include (according to class interest) dieting, body modification, bodily violence, medical technologies.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Comparative Theory and the Intellectual Dopico   Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Garcia What is the relationship of autobiographical acts to history? How does the decline of history as an \u201cautonomous and self-authenticating mode of thought,\u201d to borrow from Hayden White, alter how we read autobiographies? Turning to literary analysis, how does autobiography figure in the tasks of autocritique associated with comparative thinking? What happens when we think of autobiographies less as \u201clife stories\u201d and more as \u201cactors,\u201d as Bruno Latour puts it, with which we interact as \u201cco-actors\u201d and by way of complex affects and associations? This course will turn periodically to theorizations of history, selfhood and objecthood. But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration. Primary writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Isaac Rosa, Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa, Guillermo del Toro, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Bernardo Atxaga, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui, Iciar Bolla\u00edn, Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez Salm\u00f3n, Chus Guti\u00e9rrez, Manuel Huerga or Agust\u00edn Villaronga. We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art.

In this class our aim is to read a range of difficult texts from both antiquity and modernity slowly and carefully, examining closely a series of important philosophical conjunctions. By examining these scenes of reception, both the ancient text and the modern shed light upon one another \u2013why do certain ancient texts come to illustrate and illuminate modern philosophy, and how do modern concerns come to re-animate the ancient texts? The conjunctions will include Sophocles\u2019 Antigone and Hegel; Presocratic philosophy and Nietzsche; Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Tyrannos and Freud; Plato\u2019s Phaedrus and Derrida; Plato\u2019s Republic and Irigaray; Antigone and Judith Butler. This class recommended for students with some experience with theory and continental philosophy who wish to deepen their understanding of these difficult thinkers. Topics: Lyric Subjectivity and Transculturation Duffy This course will explore the development of lyric poetry from the troubadours to the European metaphysicals, exploring imitation, competition, and anxiety as driving forces of lyric production within a transcultural framework. Primary Texts will include works by Arnaut Daniel, Dante, Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, Garcilaso de la Vega, Lu\u00eds Vas de Cam\u00f5es, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, Jan Van der Noot, Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, Jean de Sponde, Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Herrera, Giambattista Marino, George Herbert, and Richard Crashaw. Critical works will include those by Thomas Greene, Leonard Forster, Teodolinda Barolini, Roland Greene, Terence Cave, Maria Rosa Menocal, Ignacio Navarette, Mario Praz, Gilles Deleuze, Heather DuBrow, and others.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Enlightenment Evil Gadberry This semester, we will investigate a series of attempts to justify the existence of evil in the world \u2013 and in us. As we read poems, novels, letters, and works of philosophy of the long eighteenth century, we will study the complaints hurled at an incomprehensibly unjust universe in a moment known for its confidence in the powers of the understanding. Our inquiry will take us from texts that try to justify a system that makes us rotten from the very beginning, to works that suggest we live in the best of possible worlds, to scathing satires of these defenses, and \u2013 most scandalously of all \u2013 to outright celebrations of wickedness. We will look at the impersonal evil of natural calamities (in the writings that emerged around the devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755) to the carefully wrought cruelties of sadism (in the Marquis deSade\u2019s Justine, for instance). As we do so, we\u2019ll think about how Enlightenment reason grapples with problems that seem to resist reason, how Enlightenment optimism stands up to critique, and how some instrumentalize (and even eroticize!) reason in pursuit of amoral pleasures. Required works will include the following primary works, many of which will be available in a coursepack: Kant, \u201cOn the Miscarriage of All Philosophical Trials in Theodicy\u201d; Kleist, \u201cThe Earthquake in Chile\u201d; Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons; Leibniz, Theodicy (selections); John Milton, Paradise Lost (selections); Pope, \u201cAn Essay on Man\u201d; Rousseau, letter to Voltaire defending Pope and Leibniz and selections from the Confessions and Social Contract; Sade, Justine; Voltaire, Candide and \u201cPoem on the Lisbon Disaster.\u201d The coursepack will also include secondary readings by Bakunin, Foucault, Lacan, and others.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Cosmopolitanism and Urban Spaces Halim The notion of cosmopolitanism has been associated, traditionally, with the city, the cosmopolite being conceived of as a privileged urbanite. Although much has changed in the way we have come to think of cosmopolitanism in recent years, we still need to ask: to what extent is everyone potentially a cosmopolite nowadays? Are there good and bad candidates for that status, and if so, what are the criteria, and who gets to decide? Are all the world\u2019s cities global cities? And what of \u201cvillage\u201d in \u201cglobal village\u201d? If we bear in mind that a substantial portion of the world\u2019s population still lives in relatively deprived semi-rural areas, how would that alter our understanding of this new cosmopolitanism, or propose other forms? In what way does the city-bred cosmopolite\u2019s thirst for pastoral images and idyllic vistas impact peasants and the countryside? What, if any, are the tactics to which rural migrants in big urban centers resort to rework old patterns of belonging and forge new attachments? In this course, we will attend to these and other questions of cosmopolitanism and globalization in rural and urban spaces through theory, literary texts and films from the Middle East, Europe and the USA.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Violence and Technology Kaffen Frequently characterized as an aberration within modernity, pervasive violence in its various forms (war, terror, crime, culture) has proven disastrously resistant to the ideals of the enlightenment, throwing them into question if not crisis. More, its relationship to technology in particular remains among the most fraught legacies of modernity. Indeed, the intersections of technology and violence have engendered the most profound critical debates and contentious cultural and artistic works of the twentieth century. In the interest of grappling with the ever increasing complexity of this relationship, we will read a broad array of critical writings on violence and technology, as they intersect with questions of politics, security, and sovereignty. At the same time, we will pay attention to the cultural and artistic expressions that critically engage with these issues from literature, music, architecture, painting, photography, cinema, video games, and assorted new media. Readings will include Eyal Weizman, George Bataille, Paul Virilio, Sasaki Ataru, TJ Clark, Walter Benjamin, Adriana Caverero, Hannah Arendt, Carl von Clausewitz, Ariella Azoulay, Jean Genet, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt, George Didi- Huberman, W.G. Sebald, Ernst Junger.  Topics: Fascism/Violence/Memory: The Case of the Spanish Civil War Matos-Martin The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) is the defining event in Spanish modern history as well as widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those three years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of the course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice.  Topics in 19th Century History: Century Literary History: Arthur Rimbaud Ross A seminar devoted to the poetry, cultural, and political context of Arthur Rimbaud.   Students must have some reading knowledge of French (there will surely be differing   levels of familiarity with French in the group) and a good French dictionary. Discussion conducted in English.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards. Requirements: One 12-15 page paper and an oral presentation. Students who want to work on a comparative project that brings in film or visual media may do so with instructor's approval.    Introduction to Comp Lit: Necessary Fiction  Basterra We like to think of ourselves as acting freely, creating our own ideas and objects. In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Salinas, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?    Junior Theory Seminar: Philosophy of the Body Bianchi What is a body, and how has the body figured in the history of Western thought? How is the body constituted in relation to its others: mind/spirit/soul? How does the body appear as an object both natural and technological? How do bodies come to bear social and political significance: in relation to sex, gender, class, race, sexuality, and bodily ability among others? How are bodies fashioned and produced by personal and cultural practices? In this class we will address the devaluation of the body and somatophobia in the history of Western philosophy, and track the resurgence of the body in 20th and 21st century thought, including existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, race theory, queer theory, disability theory and \u201cnew materialisms.\u201d Lastly, we will examine critical analyses of bodily regimes and practices, which may include (according to class interest) dieting, body modification, bodily violence, medical technologies.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Comparative Theory and the Intellectual Dopico   Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Garcia What is the relationship of autobiographical acts to history? How does the decline of history as an \u201cautonomous and self-authenticating mode of thought,\u201d to borrow from Hayden White, alter how we read autobiographies? Turning to literary analysis, how does autobiography figure in the tasks of autocritique associated with comparative thinking? What happens when we think of autobiographies less as \u201clife stories\u201d and more as \u201cactors,\u201d as Bruno Latour puts it, with which we interact as \u201cco-actors\u201d and by way of complex affects and associations? This course will turn periodically to theorizations of history, selfhood and objecthood. But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration.

We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia.

COLIT-UA 998         Course Descriptions  Readings in Contemporary Lit: The form of Planetary Criticism/Death Drive/Aesthetics of Catastrophe Apter This   course will examine theories of the death drive in the aesthetics of   catastrophism drawing on classic texts by Freud, Italo Svevo, Melanie   Klein, Lacan, Georges Bataille and Marguerite Duras, as well as recent   work on worlds as places of catastrophe, dystopia, planetary dysphoria   (depression), and earthly extinction (Ray Brassier\u2019s \u201cnihil unbound,\u201d   Eugene Thacker\u2019s \u201cdark pantheism\u201d). The aim will be to emphasize   psychical processes in diagnoses of planetarity, while trying to avoid a   heavy-handed reliance on allegories of World System or the Planet or   Capital that impute subjective personalities to political entities and   geographic phantasms. We will experiment with an \u201cecology\u201d of what   Melanie Klein called \u201cthe depressive position,\u201d as it suffuses every   aspect of everyday life.   Readings in Contemporary Lit: Feminist Theory and Philosophy  Bianchi In   this course we will address key texts and debates in feminist and   gender theory. We will consider various theoretical foundations -   Marxism, psychoanalysis, structuralism \u2013 that have informed feminist   politics and thought, and focus on conflicts within feminism emerging   along lines of class, race, and sexual and gender identity. The course   will examine feminist approaches to knowledge and power, in particular   feminist/queer approaches to pornography, sexuality and sex work in a   global frame, and feminist critiques of science.  Junior Theory Seminar: Black Atlantic Writers  Garcia What kind of designation is the \u201cBlack Atlantic\u201d and which writers belong within its reach? This seminar explores European, Caribbean and American texts alongside theories of the Black Atlantic and other accounts of modern racial formation. Writers include Frederick Douglass, Alain Locke, Edouard Glissant, Nella Larsen, W. E. B. Du Bois, Fernando Ortiz, C. L. R. James and Stuart Hall. Topics include modernism in African American literary culture, the reading of \u201crace\u201d in British cultural studies, and the history of Afro-Cuban modernity.  Comparative Imperialisms: Anglophone Middle Eastern Literature   Halim Although literature by Middle Easterners, particularly Arabs, in English not a new phenomenon, it has boomed in recent decades. In addressing Anglophone Middle Eastern literatures, this course covers the output of both writers resident in their country of origin and ones living in the diaspora, across a range of genres, including poetry, fiction, essay, and memoir (especially cookbook memoirs). Focusing on the increasing racialization of Arabs and Muslims in the USA after 9/11 and the War on Iraq, we will pay special attention to Anglophone literature by Arab-Americans and the riposte to stereotypes it represents. Drawing on postcolonial theory and transnational studies, the course will pose, among others, the following questions: How do we parse the legacy of Orientalism in the way religion and gender inflect the perceptions of Middle Easterners, for example in the image of the veil in relation to the trope of the harem? Are there certain genres that have been privileged over others by \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the Middle East, and if so, how would we explain this? What risks of complicity may come with identities hyphenated across warring sides? What are the uses and perils at stake in deploying \u201cexile\u201d as a metaphor? Just to what extent are the terms available to describe these \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2013 \u201cArab-American\u201d; \u201cIranian-American\u201d; \u201cAmerican Muslim\u201d; \u201cMiddle Easterner\u201d \u2013 adequate or incisive? In what way has the Arab Spring affected perceptions of Middle Easterners in Norh America? Readings by, among others: Diana Abu-Jaber; Carol Bardenstein; Hamid Dabashi; Suheir Hammad; Mohja Kahf; Hisham Matar; Nadine Naber; Azar Nafisi; Edward W. Said; Ahdaf Soueif.  Intro to Comp Lit: ECSTASY  Lezra Ec-stasy , to be drawn out of one\u2019s place, out of oneself; to be moved, enraptured, captivated. A religious experience, an erotic one, an aesthetic one; the fruit of alcohol or psychotropics, of reading or thinking, of a transcendent vision, of a sublime experience, of the touch of flesh on flesh. Also a hint of the dangerous: to lose oneself, or to lose the self\u2014with the threat that one will be unable to return to what one was, or that one will be destroyed. A fringe-concept and a fringe-experience. Literature\u2014itself a sort of border-concept, attached to different forms of expression: philosophy, theology, mythology, visual art, film, music\u2014has an old, peculiar relation to ecstasy. That relation is the subject of our class. This course serves as an Introduction to Comparative Literature through ecstasy. We will read, watch, view and listen to philosophical works by Plato (the \u201cSymposium\u201d and the \u201cPhaedrus\u201d), Kant ( Critique of Judgment ), Bataille, Adorno, Irigaray, Williams, Foucault, Deleuze, Berlant and others; fiction by Woolf ( To the Lighthouse ), Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and Lispector; religious/autobiographical works by Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross; poetry by Ovid, Petrarch, Donne, Ronsard, Shakespeare, Quevedo, Shelley, Hopkins, and Moore; films by Bu\u00f1uel ( Belle de jour ), Almod\u00f3var ( Matador ), Hitchcock ( Rope ); Mozart/da Ponte\u2019s opera Don Giovanni ); selections from Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio , and albums by Patti Smith, the Velvet Underground, the Doors, and Nirvana; and sexological treatises by Sacher-Masoch. (Not all of these, but many of them.)  The Spanish Civil War: Fascism, Violence and Memory  Matos-Martin Widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II, the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) \u201crevealed what war on European soil could mean, presaging the purificatory, genocidal, and retributive conflicts of those many other civil wars waged across the continent between 1939 and the end of the 1940s,\u201d as historian Helen Graham argues. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those conflict years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of this course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war through its politics of death and repression, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed might include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice. Writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Max Aub, Guillermo del Toro, Ken Loach, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, Rafael Alberti, Pablo Neruda, Isaac Rosa, David Trueba, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuerda, Pablo Picasso, and Isaac Rosa.  Text and Ideas: Paranoia  Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works, such as Daniel Paul Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four , Bessie Head\u2019s A Question of Power , J.M. Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction  Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive, 2)word/image relations, and 3) fiction vs. document. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in an archive of your choice.
