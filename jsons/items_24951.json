Undergraduate, masters and doctoral courses are offered in both general and specialized research areas. [Note: IDRS does not offer stand alone degree programs.]    Because the combinations of research courses required by various programs differ, students are urged to register for these research courses only after consultations with their advisors and, if needed, in consultation with the IDRS co-directors Marc Scott (quantitative) and Lisa Stulberg (qualitative). A set of suggested classes is given next.    NOTE: Applied Statistics courses are now listed primarily as part of the Applied Statistics for Social Science Research (A3SR) masters program and use a new prefix, APSTA. When they have broader appeal and purpose, we list them below.    At the masters and undergraduate level, courses are offered in basic statistics (undergraduate: APSTA-UE 0020 or APSTA-UE 1085; masters: APSTA-GE 2085 - APSTA-GE 2086). Many of the doctoral course offerings are open to advanced master's students. In particular, master's students who intend to take additional statistics classes must begin with APSTA-GE 2001-APSTA-GE 2002, described next, rather than APSTA-GE 2085-APSTA-GE 2086. Consultation with advisor and instructor is highly recommended    At the doctoral level, the required quantitative sequence is statistics for the social and behavioral sciences I &amp; II (APSTA-GE 2001 - APSTA-GE 2002) followed by intermediate and advanced quantitative methods (APSTA-GE 2003 - APSTA-GE 2004). For quantitative work, it is recommended that the first year of statistics be taken in the first year of the course of study. Possible variations on this sequencing may be found on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pages. APSTA-GE 2003-APSTA-GE 2004 are gateway courses that serve as prerequisites for advanced topics such as causal inference (APSTA-GE 2012) and multilevel models (APSTA-GE 2040/41-APSTA-GE 2042).    Biostatistics I &amp; II (APSTA-GE 2995, APSTA-GE 2996) form an alternate first year statistics sequence. They are recommended for master's students specializing in the health professions and for some doctoral students in nursing and health related disciplines. You are advised to consult the links on FAQ pages regarding the appropriateness of this sequence for your field of study.    For graduate students interested in doing qualitative research projects, especially doctoral students who plan to write dissertations involving qualitative interviews or fieldwork, we offer a number of qualitative methods courses. The first class in the series for many students is RESCH-GE 2140. Approaches to Qualitative Inquiry. This is a prerequisite for a number of advanced courses in the qualitative methods series, like RESCH-GE 2141. Case Study and Ethnographic Inquiry, RESCH-GE 2141. Interviewing and Observation, and RESCH-GE 2147. Fieldwork: Data Collection. Other qualitative specialization courses -- which do not require RESCH-GE 2140 as a prerequisite -- include historical research (RESCH-GE 2135) and participatory action research (RESCH-GE 2143).    Doctoral students often take writing empirical research (RESCH-GE 2138) and dissertation proposal seminar (TCHL-GE 3001) as well.    Students should take several 3-point design courses: empirical methods (RESCH-GE 2132) or its equivalent, followed by survey research (APSTA-GE 2139) and/or Large Databases (APSTA-GE 2110).

The program brings together a group of students with quantitatively-focused interests and career ambitions to provide them with rigorous training in quantitative techniques and applied statistical analysis. The structure of the program is designed to improve students' understanding of quantitative research and prepare them for a number of possible careers in the private or public sector, as well as for further academic study. Students in the AQR program complete a 34 credit curriculum , gaining a strong foundation in the statistical tools and theoretical perspectives used in the social sciences while allowing them flexibility to pursue their own interests and develop specialized skills. In addition to the mandatory core courses in the program, students also choose elective courses from the Sociology Department and from the offerings of other departments and schools at NYU. Students draw on these resources to make the most of their experience at the University. Graduates of the program will acquire the tools necessary for a variety of professional endeavors. A large percentage of graduates of the program will take up research positions in non-profit and government agencies at the federal, state, and local levels, while some will enter careers in evaluation, marketing or finance, using the tools developed through the program for analysis of data. Other graduates will enter doctoral programs in the social sciences at top universities in the United States and abroad. The tools that students develop through the AQR program will allow them to find employment opportunities in a number of traditional or emerging fields requiring the use of advanced statistical training.

Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This course offers a hands-on opportunity for doctoral and advanced masters students to experience the practice of qualitative research. We will address the nature of qualitative research in the administrative and policy sciences, with ample opportunities to discuss the implications of the choices made in designing, implementing and reporting on the findings of a \u201cmock\u201d project which we will determine in class, with your input. The course will require a considerable investment of time, with intensive reading and writing, recurrent team discussions based on assignments, and individual fieldwork (with journal writing before, during and after site visits). The course is a program requirement for doctoral students. For all masters students, it will help develop skills to collect qualitative data during capstone projects and for policy/finance students interested in a methods course sequence, it will also serve as a good complement to the available quantitative courses. For all students, understanding the basics of qualitative research will make you a better researcher (independent of whether your research is only qualitative or only quantitative) and will increase your research competency by offering a foundation to do mixed methods.    Prerequisites: Doctoral Research Seminar: Research Methods (or equivalent, approved by instructor). Masters students must fill an application and be approved to take the course.

Undergraduate, masters and doctoral courses are offered in both general and specialized research areas. [Note: IDRS does not offer stand alone degree programs.]    Because the combinations of research courses required by various programs differ, students are urged to register for these research courses only after consultations with their advisors and, if needed, in consultation with the IDRS co-directors Marc Scott (quantitative) and Lisa Stulberg (qualitative). A set of suggested classes is given next.    NOTE: Applied Statistics courses are now listed primarily as part of the Applied Statistics for Social Science Research (A3SR) masters program and use a new prefix, APSTA. When they have broader appeal and purpose, we list them below.    At the masters and undergraduate level, courses are offered in basic statistics (undergraduate: APSTA-UE 0020 or APSTA-UE 1085; masters: APSTA-GE 2085 - APSTA-GE 2086). Many of the doctoral course offerings are open to advanced master's students. In particular, master's students who intend to take additional statistics classes must begin with APSTA-GE 2001-APSTA-GE 2002, described next, rather than APSTA-GE 2085-APSTA-GE 2086. Consultation with advisor and instructor is highly recommended    At the doctoral level, the required quantitative sequence is statistics for the social and behavioral sciences I &amp; II (APSTA-GE 2001 - APSTA-GE 2002) followed by intermediate and advanced quantitative methods (APSTA-GE 2003 - APSTA-GE 2004). For quantitative work, it is recommended that the first year of statistics be taken in the first year of the course of study. Possible variations on this sequencing may be found on the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) pages. APSTA-GE 2003-APSTA-GE 2004 are gateway courses that serve as prerequisites for advanced topics such as causal inference (APSTA-GE 2012) and multilevel models (APSTA-GE 2040/41-APSTA-GE 2042).    Biostatistics I &amp; II (APSTA-GE 2995, APSTA-GE 2996) form an alternate first year statistics sequence. They are recommended for master's students specializing in the health professions and for some doctoral students in nursing and health related disciplines. You are advised to consult the links on FAQ pages regarding the appropriateness of this sequence for your field of study.    For graduate students interested in doing qualitative research projects, especially doctoral students who plan to write dissertations involving qualitative interviews or fieldwork, we offer a number of qualitative methods courses. The first class in the series for many students is RESCH-GE 2140. Approaches to Qualitative Inquiry. This is a prerequisite for a number of advanced courses in the qualitative methods series, like RESCH-GE 2141. Case Study and Ethnographic Inquiry, RESCH-GE 2141. Interviewing and Observation, and RESCH-GE 2147. Fieldwork: Data Collection. Other qualitative specialization courses -- which do not require RESCH-GE 2140 as a prerequisite -- include historical research (RESCH-GE 2135) and participatory action research (RESCH-GE 2143).    Doctoral students often take writing empirical research (RESCH-GE 2138) and dissertation proposal seminar (TCHL-GE 3001) as well.    Students should take several 3-point design courses: empirical methods (RESCH-GE 2132) or its equivalent, followed by survey research (APSTA-GE 2139) and/or Large Databases (APSTA-GE 2110).
