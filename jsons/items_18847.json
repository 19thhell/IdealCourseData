Connect to NYU Libraries Resources    Some NYU Libraries resources can be accessed through the Research Tab in   NYUHome . Some online Libraries resources require a  specific proxy configuration, so the subscription resources that NYU makes available to students,  faculty, and staff recognize that you are a part of the NYU community. For more information on  which Libraries resources require NYU-NET Proxy, and instructions on how to  configure proxy settings for your computer, see the NYU-NET Proxy page  of this website.
