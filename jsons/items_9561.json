One   can argue that the discipline itself has developed through the study of   Hollywood cinema during the Studio Era. From Bellour\u2019s   semiotic-psychoanalytic approach to the theory of the \u201cprogressive   text\u201d, to Feminist Film Theory, to Bordwell\u2019s neo-formalist approach,   etc.: each new methodology has built up its conceptual framework by   considering first of all classical American cinema. The centrality of   Hollywood cinema was first put into question by the new historical   approach that emerged in the late \u201880s and which took early cinema as   its object of study. Working within the domain of modernity, scholars   like Gunning and Hansen redefined the field in many ways. Besides   working primarily on early cinema they also displaced the centrality of   theory and of film analysis by advocating a convergence of theory and   history. This \u201cparadigm shift\u201d heavily redefined Feminist Film Theory   and spurred a new historical trend in Women/Gender Film Studies which   keeps producing important work.  Starting from these   assumptions, my talk will offer a critical reading of the different   methodologies that have developed in Film Studies in relation to   Hollywood cinema. Then I will show why, to my mind, a convergence of   history and theory along the lines initiated by Gunning and Hansen also   suits an interpretation of classical Hollywood cinema. I will detail my   position by historicizing one of the most influential concepts, namely   Gunning\u2019s (and Mulvey\u2019s) notion of attraction.
