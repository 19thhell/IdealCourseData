The program&rsquo;s internationally recognized faculty encourage MCC majors to think deeply and broadly about culture and media using theoretical and historical frameworks. The components of the major include core courses in theory and analysis, and upper-level courses in two of the following fields of study : Global and Transcultural Communication, Images and Screen Studies, Interaction and Social Processes, Persuasion and Politics, Technology and Society .    A majority of MCC students take advantage of study opportunities abroad to cultivate a deeper knowledge of the global and transnational issues associated with the production, circulation, and reception of contemporary media.

What You'll Learn Upon completion of program requirements, undergraduate majors are expected to be able to:       Demonstrate analytical and critical thinking, formulate pertinent research questions and appropriate methodologies, evaluate and use suitable reference materials and primary and secondary sources    Know and understand the key concepts in the study of media, culture, and communication and have fluency in the core scholarly work in these fields    Undertake close readings of written, aural, audio and visual texts    Utilize global and cosmopolitan approaches in the transnational study of media and culture    Attain facility with project-based and fieldwork data collection, and a range of modes for the presentation of findings       Careers The Media, Culture, and Communication program offers students a theoretical background for entry into a wide range of careers and graduate study. New York University was named the best school for media professionals by LinkedIn, in large part because of the success of MCC graduates. A 2014 survey of recent MCC alumni showed that 95% of responders were either full-time employees or in graduate school. In addition, 73% of responders had accepted offers for full-time employment within the first 3 months after graduating.    Our alumni work for companies and organizations such as Viacom, Buzzfeed, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Simon and Schuster, CBS News, ESPN, NBC Universal, Sony Pictures, The New York Times, Capitol Music Group, the United Nations, the BBC, Nielsen, Conde Nast, among many others. They are enrolled in graduate study at universities across the globe, including Harvard, Columbia, Duke, Brown, Cambridge (UK), McGill (Canada), and Ritsumeikan University (Japan).
