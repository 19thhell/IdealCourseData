One of the United State's most creative and energetic cities, New York City's historic neighborhoods have attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals.   Beyond the the campus, New York City becomes an extension of the University's campus. With institutes and centers on the Upper East Side and academic buildings down in the Financial District, getting from place to place at NYU requires a little assistance.                                                          Public Transit                                                                                               Hop Stop Your Way Around NYC                                                                                         Find Your Way Around Campus                                         Luckily, there are a lot of options available to get around New York City. NYU Transportation services run between the Washington Square campus and NYU residence halls. The MTA runs the subway, train and bus systems that will get you where you need to go.   If all else fails, head over to Broadway to catch a cab downtown (yellow cabs only, please) or over to Sixth Avenue to catch one going uptown.                                Jeffrey S.

There are limited lodging options in the immediate NYU area, so you may want to consider staying further uptown, or even outside of the city. Read More                   Transportation The NYU Department of Public Safety manages campus transportation services between the Washington Square campus and student residence halls and apartment buildings that are located beyond walking distance.
