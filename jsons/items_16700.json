Want to learn the right areas of CS to help you have relevant and useful skills for entering the game industry? Curious about game engineering research and interested in participating while you are an undergraduate? This minor may be of interest to you. Take a look at the requirements (below), and then either attend the Open House at the MAGNET center on Friday, October 25 at noon (lunch provided), or direct inquiries to the CSE academic advising coordinator, Susana Garcia-Henriquez ( sgarcia@poly.edu )               Structure of the Minor:               Prerequisites  (12 credits)        Students will be expected to complete a minimal core curriculum in the CSE undergraduate program before enrolling in the minor, in order to be well prepared for the game engineering coursework. This means students who would like to receive the minor who are not also CSE majors will have to complete these courses (or show equivalent mastery) in addition to the minor requirements. These courses are: Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures and Algorithms.                Note  : students completing the minor from outside CSE can request permission to apply a portion of these prerequisite credits to the overall credit total for the minor. No more than 6 credits may be applied.               Minor Courses:        The minor consists of 15 credit units. Each course taken may count for only one requirement (so a single class may not serve two requirements simultaneously).               Core (6 credits):        All students will need to complete the Game Programming course and at least one game development course. Courses meeting the game development requirement are Minimalist Game Design, Game Development Studio 1 (cross-listed DM/CSE), and Game Development Project Studio (Tisch School of the Arts Game Center).               Core electives (6 credits):        In addition to these two courses, students must take 2 additional game engineering courses within NYU-Poly CSE curriculum. Course options include:                     Introduction to Computer Graphics                Introduction to Artificial Intelligence                Introduction to Human Computer Interaction                Mobile Application Development                Minimalist Game Design                     University-wide electives (3 credits):        Students may take an additional CSE Game Engineering elective, or they may submit another Game Engineering-related elective for consideration for approval as part of their minor, from anywhere within NYU and NYU-Poly. Sample courses that could be relevant from across the university include:                     3D Graphics Studio I in Poly Digital Media program                Introduction to Game Design, Game Development Project Studio, and Games 101 in Tisch School of the Arts Game Center                Designing Simulations and Games for Learning in Steinhart Digital Media and Design for Learning program                Social Multiplayer Games and Computer Games, Courant Institute Computer Science Department                                                                        Search for:                                                                                                                                           Events               No Upcoming Events                                          Gallery         Google+                                                                    All content 2014 Game Innovation Lab and NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.

Want to learn the right areas of CS to help you have relevant and useful skills for entering the game industry? Curious about game engineering research and interested in participating while you are an undergraduate? This minor may be of interest to you. Take a look at the requirements (below), and then either attend the Open House at the MAGNET center on Friday, October 25 at noon (lunch provided), or direct inquiries to the CSE academic advising coordinator, Susana Garcia-Henriquez ( sgarcia@poly.edu )               Structure of the Minor:               Prerequisites  (12 credits)        Students will be expected to complete a minimal core curriculum in the CSE undergraduate program before enrolling in the minor, in order to be well prepared for the game engineering coursework. This means students who would like to receive the minor who are not also CSE majors will have to complete these courses (or show equivalent mastery) in addition to the minor requirements. These courses are: Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures and Algorithms.                Note  : students completing the minor from outside CSE can request permission to apply a portion of these prerequisite credits to the overall credit total for the minor. No more than 6 credits may be applied.               Minor Courses:        The minor consists of 15 credit units. Each course taken may count for only one requirement (so a single class may not serve two requirements simultaneously).               Core (6 credits):        All students will need to complete the Game Programming course and at least one game development course. Courses meeting the game development requirement are Minimalist Game Design, Game Development Studio 1 (cross-listed DM/CSE), and Game Development Project Studio (Tisch School of the Arts Game Center).               Core electives (6 credits):        In addition to these two courses, students must take 2 additional game engineering courses within NYU-Poly CSE curriculum. Course options include:                     Introduction to Computer Graphics                Introduction to Artificial Intelligence                Introduction to Human Computer Interaction                Mobile Application Development                Minimalist Game Design                     University-wide electives (3 credits):        Students may take an additional CSE Game Engineering elective, or they may submit another Game Engineering-related elective for consideration for approval as part of their minor, from anywhere within NYU and NYU-Poly. Sample courses that could be relevant from across the university include:                     3D Graphics Studio I in Poly Digital Media program                Introduction to Game Design, Game Development Project Studio, and Games 101 in Tisch School of the Arts Game Center                Designing Simulations and Games for Learning in Steinhart Digital Media and Design for Learning program                Social Multiplayer Games and Computer Games, Courant Institute Computer Science Department                                                                        Search for:                                                                                                                                           Events               No Upcoming Events                                          Gallery         Google+                                                                    All content 2014 Game Innovation Lab and NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.

Both were named as top places to study video game design in the Review&rsquo;s 2011-2012 survey of 150 institutions offering undergraduate and graduate coursework and degrees in the United States and Canada.   &ldquo;We have an engineering and computer science focus at NYU-Poly, which allows students to go deeper into the programming and hardware side of games than they can at other schools,&rdquo; explained Katherine Isbister, director of NYU-Poly&rsquo;s Game Innovation Lab and associate professor of computer science and engineering. NYU-Poly&rsquo;s state-of-the-art Game Innovation Lab and its user-research facility are just two components in a richly integrated ecosystem NYU-Poly and NYU have created for students to get theoretical and practical experience designing games.   NYU already offers undergraduate and graduate courses, concentrations, and degrees that prepare students for careers in the more than $10.5 billion video game industry, but beginning in the fall of 2012, the NYU Game Center will begin to offer a Master of Fine Arts degree in game design. The program is unique because it looks at gaming across a variety of media, including consoles, PCs, smartphones and social networks.   &ldquo;Games are the defining cultural form of this century and the NYU Game Center MFA is dedicated to exploring their potential,&rdquo; says Director Frank Lantz. &ldquo;There are places to study the technical and business aspects of games, but the Game Center MFA has a unique creative focus on games for today&rsquo;s platforms.&rdquo;   As gaming takes a larger chunk of the media and entertainment market &mdash;the entertainment software industry&rsquo;s annual growth rate from 2005 to 2009 was more than 10 percent according to the Entertainment Software Association&mdash; it also benefits gaming students to be in the media capital of New York City.   &ldquo;New York City itself has a thriving community of independent game developers and companies small and large, where students can intern, and from whom we have frequent invited lectures to encourage real-world problem solving and innovation among the students,&rdquo; says Isbister.   The Princeton Review asked administrators 50 questions, covering topics from academics and faculty credentials to graduates&#39; employment and career achievements, in its survey. Criteria for selections included the quality of the curriculum, faculty, facilities, and infrastructure. The survey also factored in data on scholarships, financial aid, and career opportunities.
