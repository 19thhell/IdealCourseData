In fact, their needs are more varied and meeting those needs may take some creativity on your part. School-age child care services may be needed for before-school, after-school, and during holiday/vacation days, and summer vacation weeks.   There are several options one might consider when scheduling your child's out-of-school time including:     Hire your child's regular care provider for additional hours and days;   Talk with other parents about sharing care, trading play dates, etc.   Hire a responsible high school, college student, or adult to care for your child alone or with a friend or two;   Determine if your child's school offers an organized program;   Determine if your local library or museum offers a special program or activity.   Explore and enroll your child in a special holiday/vacation camp program .       NYC School-Age Child Care Licensing Regulations     In New York City school-age services are a licensed form of care.
