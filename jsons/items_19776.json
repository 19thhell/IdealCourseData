Finally, if your show idea is accepted, you will be allowed to create a pilot of your show.      Your success for Steps 1 - 3 will determine if your show will become a regular part of NYU-TV programming.                                            I produced my own video. Can I air it on NYU-TV?                      Yes. NYU-TV welcomes submissions from faculty, staff, and students. Submit a request through our Programming Request Form . Have a DVD or VHS preview copy that can be dropped off at our offices. As with any broadcast, copyright issues may apply.                                            When will we be able to watch NYU-TV online?                      It is possible to watch a selection of mulitmedia clips from NYU Events in the form of webcasts and podcasts online right now . At the moment, none of the NYU-TV channels are available via streaming. Until this is possible, we will be adding streaming content of different programs to our website.                                            Is it possible to get/watch NYU-TV off campus?                        Unfortunately, it is not. NYU-TV and Campus Cable are both private, closed-circuit systems and can only be viewed from campus residence halls and academic buildings.

The schedule for the rest of the cable channels can be found at: ZAP2IT .                                             Why dont movies on Channel 15 run 24 hours a day?                      The movies on the NYU-TV movie channel do run throughout a 24 hour period, but they are on a schedule of three movies per day, airing three times each. With set start times, weve found that it is much easier for our viewers to have a consistent schedule to know when to tune in for the beginning of each film.                                             Why is there so much dead air between movies?                       Because NYU-TVs Movie Channel has a set schedule of start times for each movie, the length of time between each movie can vary. Some movies are only ninety minutes long, while others are nearly three hours long. Unless otherwise noted on the schedule, you can find a movie on the movie channel every two and half hours.

Can I air a documentary or film on NYU-TV for my students to see outside the classroom?                      NYU-TV works with the Avery Fisher Center to secure public performance rights for videotapes to air for educational use. There are a number of distributors who allow NYU-TV to air videotapes purchased by the Avery Fisher Center. Consult Bobcat to see if the videotape is already in the library. Regarding feature films, rights must first be secured in order to air them. Call NYU-TVs programming dept. at 212.998.5168 to see if we already have rights or if they can be secured. Students can view NYU-TV in residence halls and various locations in campus buildings.                                   My department is holding an event.

Why is there so much dead air between movies?                       Because NYU-TVs Movie Channel has a set schedule of start times for each movie, the length of time between each movie can vary. Some movies are only ninety minutes long, while others are nearly three hours long. Unless otherwise noted on the schedule, you can find a movie on the movie channel every two and half hours.                                           Is there an NYU forum where I can get regular email on whats playing/new?                      There sure is. The NYU-TV listserve is an announcement only list, which is sent out once or twice per month to announce new programming and special events. Go to the In the Know page to for instructions on how to join.                 Faculty Services                                      I show video, documentary, and film clips in my class. Can I air a documentary or film on NYU-TV for my students to see outside the classroom?                      NYU-TV works with the Avery Fisher Center to secure public performance rights for videotapes to air for educational use. There are a number of distributors who allow NYU-TV to air videotapes purchased by the Avery Fisher Center. Consult Bobcat to see if the videotape is already in the library. Regarding feature films, rights must first be secured in order to air them. Call NYU-TVs programming dept. at 212.998.5168 to see if we already have rights or if they can be secured. Students can view NYU-TV in residence halls and various locations in campus buildings.                                   My department is holding an event. Can I publicize it via NYU-TV?                      You bet. NYU-TVs Happenings Channel provides listings of on-campus or NYU-related events via an electronic billboard system.
