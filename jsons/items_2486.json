The degree of master of arts in French literature is prerequisite to the doctor of philosophy. All doctoral candidates in French should complete at least one course (including M.A. work) in each of seven areas of French and Francophone literature and one course in literary theory. All students are required to take the Proseminar, FREN-GA 2957 and the two-credit seminar in Teaching French as a Foreign Language, FREN-GA 1012. In consultation with the director of graduate studies, doctoral students may enroll in a limited number of courses outside the department in areas related to their interests, or they may choose a field of study of up to five courses in another discipline: linguistics, art history, cinema studies, performance studies, or comparative literature. Knowledge of a second foreign language is required by the French department for the doctorate and must be demonstrated before completion of 60 points by any of the methods described in the Degree Requirements section of this bulletin or by passing with a grade of B or better a graduate course taught in that language. To have approved a language other than German, Italian, Spanish, or Latin as the second foreign language a student must meet with the Director of Graduate Studies. Decision is taken on the basis of the need of that language for the student's work. An examination composed of a two-hour oral portion and a take-home written portion is taken on completion of the required course work. This examination is structured as a series of inquiries (major authors, genres, and special topics) selected by the candidate, in consultation with the faculty. As soon as possible, but no later than two semesters after the successful completion of the Ph.D. qualifying examination, the student must submit a dissertation prospectus on which he or she will be orally examined for one hour. When the student has completed at least one year in residence and all course and language requirements, and passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination and the dissertation proposal examination, the student is formally admitted to candidacy for the doctorate, and a dissertation committee of five members is named. When the dissertation is completed and approved by the adviser and readers, an oral examination is held at which the candidate presents and defends research results to a faculty committee of five.

His works allow us to rethink the traditional   relationship between the author and the reader. For my research, I have   selected texts by Artaud in which the suspension of interpretation is   particularly blatant. By analyzing these different experiences of   reading, I demonstrate how the closure of interpretation takes place,   allowing to theorize a non-hermeneutical reading. Research Interests: 20th   century literature and poetry, literary theory &amp; theories of   reading, intersection of literature and philosophy, the sacred,   epistolary writing, literary reviews.

He investigates how these students experience curricular, student-life, and social-aid offerings in the wake of demographic changes to the profile of \u201cthe student.\u201d His work also examines how universit\u00e9s teach and administer poverty- and working-class students amid the political context of uncertainty regarding educational \u201cdemocratization,\u201d \u201cmeritocracy,\u201d and \u201cequality of opportunity.\u201d Additionally, Nicholas has designed an undergraduate syllabus that uses detective fiction to approach the study of literary genres and consecration as well as problems in French history.
