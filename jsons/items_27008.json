The M.A. and Ph.D. programs offer a broad-based intellectual, critical, and aesthetic foundation along with opportunities for frequent collaboration among scholars, actors, directors, playwrights, designers, and performance and new media artists -- in the classroom and in production. Graduate students may serve as dramaturgs and literary-historical resource people on M.F.A. creative projects. New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, Department of Performance Studies http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/performance/ The Department of Performance Studies offers the first MA/Ph.D. program in the world to focus on performance as the object of analysis. Using performance as an organizing concept, we study a broad spectrum of performances from postmodern dance and Hip Hop to political rallies, Butoh, and vaudeville. Although we are primarily an academic program, students can integrate theory and practice in such workshops and courses as performance composition, performance writing, dramaturgy, theories of directing, and performance and technology. Northwestern University, School of Communication, Performance Studies http://www.communication.northwestern.edu/performancestudies/ Performance Studies has at its center the written and spoken word, gesture and image, text and body, performance and analysis. Historically grounded in the oral interpretation of poetry and fiction, Performance Studies as an evolving practice seeks to engage performance at every front, to open and broaden the definition of performance and the texts that prompt them, to explore performance practices and test the ground on which they rest. Roehampton Univeristy of Surrey, UK, Performance Studies http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/pg/ps/ The MA/MRes Performance Studies programmes have an identity and profile distinct from existing provision in the field. Their particular research and critical agendas stage a timely intervention in the international direction of the discipline. The perspectives they mobilise, and their engagement with questions of performance and space, ethics, cultural politics and critical practices, provide a unique and stimulating programme of study for the student who wishes to address the discipline at its cutting edge. The Scarborough School of Arts, UK, Performance Studies http://www.scar.hull.ac.uk/arts/performance/perf_studies.htm The program is practical as well as theoretical, encouraging engagement in issues pertinent to the complex and changing world in which you live. Importance is given to making art as a reaction to and communication in culture through processes of collaboration alongside evolving independent practice. A core series of Performance Studies modules establishes the theoretical and practical connections that address 21st century performance as a cultural phenomenon and ensure educational coherence. The core provides introduction and practise in the activities, theories and politics of performance including the skills of collaboration in art making processes. University of California, Berkeley, Department of Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/theater/ The program is an unusually flexible one, designed to prepare students for advanced research in the field of theater and performance studies. The program at Berkeley draws its strengths from a Graduate Group of faculty in disciplines ranging across a host of fields and departments; we encourage students to take the initiative in developing a program of coursework that will lead both to a solid command of a given field and to the kind of interdisciplinary research characteristic of the strongest work in theater and performance studies today. University of Mainz, Germany, PhD Program in Performance and Media Studies http://www.performedia.uni-mainz.de The University of Mainz, together with the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the German Research Association (DFG), has launched an international doctoral program in Performance and Media Studies (Theater, Film and Television). The program is designed to support interdisciplinary doctoral research at an internationally competitive level in the fields of theatre, drama, performance, film, television and the new media. The program offers a unique combination of intensive individual supervision by the local program-faculty and an internationally oriented and interdisciplinary course-program within a network of seven international partner-institutions. University of Maryland, Ph. D. in Theater and Performance Studies http://www.theatre.umd.edu/Graduate/PhD.htm The Ph.D is an interdisciplinary degree that prepares teachers and scholars of theatre and performance studies. The program offers students two interrelated areas of concentration: 1) history & theory of theatre and drama 2) theatre and performance studies. Area studies in the history and theory of drama and theatre focus primarily on developments in Western theatre practice and dramatic literature. Area studies in theatre and performance studies focus on a broad spectrum of international and American performance traditions as seen through a flexible framework of interdisciplinary methodologies. Although points of intersection are inevitable between traditional study of theatre and drama and the evolving field of performance studies, the latter is distinguished by its broadly conceived definitions of performance. University of Sydney, the School of Society, Culture and Performance http://www.arts.usyd.edu.au/departs/perform/ University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies, in conjunction with the Center for Performance Research http://www.aber.ac.uk/publications/ug/tfts/performance-modules.html The program is organized by three individual modules: Principles of Performance 1, 2, and Performance in Context. The module is comprised of 10 one-and-a-half hour lectures and two one-and-a-half hour seminars related to your assessment assignments. The object of the module is to provide working definitions of the phenomenon of performance, provide an introduction to the field of performance theory, to examine approaches to the analysis of performative behaviours and non-textual genres of performance and to encourage practical initiatives in the area of conceiving performance. top Institutes, Centers, Professional Associations Center for Performance Research, University of Wales, Aberystwyth http://www.thecpr.org.uk/ Established in 1988, by Richard Gough and Judie Christie, the Centre for Performance Research is a theatre organization based in Wales and working internationally. It produces: innovative performance work; arranges workshops, conferences, lectures and master classes; collaborates and exchanges with theatre companies of international significance; publishes and distributes theatre books and runs a multi-cultural performance resource centre that encourages international exchange. The Center publishes the journal Performance Research. Hemispheric Institute for Performance and Politics, New York University http://www.hemi.nyu.edu/ Hemispheric Institute draws on the emerging discipline of Performance Studies to foster intellectual and artistic relationships across boundaries of geography, institutions, languages, and academic disciplines. Studying performance in its myriad manifestations (as act, as masquerade, as intervention), scholars, activists and artists can analyze the ways in which performance is used to communicate social or religious values, to elicit identification, or to forge a sense of community. But politics itself also provides a rich arena for performance analysis: electoral politics, populism, protest movements, military parades, and mass rallies are just a few of the spectacles that can be best analyzed using a performative lens. The Institute thus explores the ways in which performance and politics are mutually formative: performance as a practice of politics, politics as a mode of performance. International Directory of Performing Arts collections and Institutions http://www.theatrelibrary.org/sibmas/idpac/ Performance Studies Focus Group http://www.ihc.ucsb.edu/research/rfgs/performance.html PSi Performance Studies International http://www.psi-web.org/ PSi PERFORMANCE STUDIES international is a professional association founded in 1997 to promote communication and exchange among scholars and practitioners working in the field of performance studies. PSi organizes an annual conference. Te Puna Toi, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand http://www.drama.canterbury.ac.nz/TePunaToi/index.htm Te Puna Toi (Performance Research Project, New Zealand) was created by the Department of Theatre and Film Studies in collaboration with the Centre for Performance Research (Aberystwyth, Wales) to support the work of New Zealand scholars and artists and to encourage international exchange. Activities include workshops, colloquia and performances. Te Puna Toi is the Christchurch home for the New Zealand Film Archive's public video library, Vaccess.
