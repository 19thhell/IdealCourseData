Medieval Archaeology: An Encyclopedia , New York: Garland Publishing.      Current News/Projects Updated November 2012 My primary area of research has focused on the study of animal bone remains from Anglo-Saxon sites in southeast England as a way of understanding early medieval animal husbandry practices, hunting patterns, and diet. My new book, Middle Saxon Animal Husbandry in East Anglia, was published this summer. It is an analysis of the animal bone remains from three Middle Saxon (ca. 700-850 CE) sites in eastern England--Brandon, Ipswich, and Wicken Bonhunt. My research on the Anglo-Saxon animal remains from St. Albans Abbbey in Hertfordshire will be published later this year as part of the excavation report. The volume will be authored and edited by Martin Biddle, it should appear in the BAR (British Archaeological Reports) series. I am also working on a book on the rebirth of towns in England in the early Middle Ages. I have taken on several new projects in the past few years. I am now the zooarchaeologist for the Amheida Project in the Dakleh Oasis of Egypt, the Early Bronze Age site of Shengavit in Yerevan, Armenia, and the Kyzyltepe project in Uzbekistan. I will also begin work on the Late Bronze Age to Iron Age of Kinik in southern Cappadocia this summer. In June I attended the ICAANE   (International Conference on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East)   in Basel. I represented a paper on my research on the animal bone   remains from the Iron Age, Hellenistic, and Medieval site of Kinik Hoyuk   in Southern Cappadocia, Turkey. In July I returned to Kinik Hoyuk,   supported by a grant from ARIT (American Research Institute in Turkey)   to analyse the animal bone remains from the Achaemenid (Persian Period)   features at the site. I also spent some time at the Neolithic and   Chalcolithic site of Ciftlik/Tepecik, where Doug Campana and I   arranged to collaborate with our Turkish colleagues on the study of the   animal bones and bone tools. I spent the last two weeks of the summer   in Antwerp working on the animal bones from the recent 9th-10th century   excavations there.

Medieval Archaeology: An Encyclopedia , New York: Garland Publishing.      Current News/Projects Updated November 2012 My primary area of research has focused on the study of animal bone remains from Anglo-Saxon sites in southeast England as a way of understanding early medieval animal husbandry practices, hunting patterns, and diet. My new book, Middle Saxon Animal Husbandry in East Anglia, was published this summer. It is an analysis of the animal bone remains from three Middle Saxon (ca. 700-850 CE) sites in eastern England--Brandon, Ipswich, and Wicken Bonhunt. My research on the Anglo-Saxon animal remains from St. Albans Abbbey in Hertfordshire will be published later this year as part of the excavation report. The volume will be authored and edited by Martin Biddle, it should appear in the BAR (British Archaeological Reports) series. I am also working on a book on the rebirth of towns in England in the early Middle Ages. I have taken on several new projects in the past few years. I am now the zooarchaeologist for the Amheida Project in the Dakleh Oasis of Egypt, the Early Bronze Age site of Shengavit in Yerevan, Armenia, and the Kyzyltepe project in Uzbekistan. I will also begin work on the Late Bronze Age to Iron Age of Kinik in southern Cappadocia this summer. In June I attended the ICAANE   (International Conference on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East)   in Basel. I represented a paper on my research on the animal bone   remains from the Iron Age, Hellenistic, and Medieval site of Kinik Hoyuk   in Southern Cappadocia, Turkey. In July I returned to Kinik Hoyuk,   supported by a grant from ARIT (American Research Institute in Turkey)   to analyse the animal bone remains from the Achaemenid (Persian Period)   features at the site. I also spent some time at the Neolithic and   Chalcolithic site of Ciftlik/Tepecik, where Doug Campana and I   arranged to collaborate with our Turkish colleagues on the study of the   animal bones and bone tools. I spent the last two weeks of the summer   in Antwerp working on the animal bones from the recent 9th-10th century   excavations there.
