Outspoken is a group of undergraduate students who have completed an intensive training on issues that are current and necessary to the understanding of the concerns in the LGBTQ community. Peer Educator training consists of: a one week training in mid-August, monthly continuing education sessions throughout the Fall and Spring semesters, and a one day Retreat in January. After this training, Outspoken members help to facilitate the various programs described below on a volunteer basis, work together to strengthen Outspoken, and work toward the achievement of its mission.   One of our most popular and well known programs is:     Safe Zone I: NYU LGBTQ 101   This is a campus wide program designed to visibly identify students, staff, and faculty peers who support the LGBTQ population, understand some of the issues facing LGBTQ individuals, and are aware of the various LGBTQ resources. The three hour training session provides a foundation of knowledge needed to be an effective ally to LGBTQ students and those questioning their sexuality. Campus wide trainings are offered twice a semester, but training sessions can be arranged for other groups by request. For more information about Safe Zone trainings, check out our Safe Zone page. Also, be on the lookout for Safe Zone II workshops--entire workshops designed for those that have completed a Safe Zone training and are interested in gainining a deeper understanding of issues and topics within the LGBTQ community.

My goal in life is to have my own talk show so I can continue to be outspoken about various lgbtqia issues. Hopefully one day you will all see me on the small screen!

Elana Blank                               Elana is a senior at Gallatin, where she is studying the destigmatization of queerness, sexuality and mental illness, and pursuing a Social Work minor. Originally from Westchester County, Elana completed three semesters at NYU before taking some time off and moving to Vermont, where she interned at an LGBTQ community center and was shocked to discover that she actually likes nature (kind of). Now that she's back in New York, Elana can be found at the Center or in her bed eating Nutella and watching Bob's Burgers.                                                                Robert Taylor                               Robert is a sophomore in the College of Arts and Science studying History and Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies on the Pre-Law track. Hoping to blend his studies together, he takes delight in one day knowing that he will be able to fend for the rights of the oppressed. As a person of Caribbean decent, he plans to use the skills acquired as an OUTSpoken Peer Educator to bring light to LGBTQ issues within his community. On any given day, one will find him doing one of three things: (1) crocheting a baby blanket,(2) being EXtremely loud, or (3) declaring things DELICIOUS with a dash of the RAINBOW!                                                                Mariah Young-Jones                               Mariah is a sophomore at Gallatin studying Human Rights and Music Production. She chose to be an OUTSpoken Peer Educator, because she wants to both better herself, as an ally, and the world at large. When she is not frequenting the LGBTQ Student Center or studying, she can be found trying out new recipes in her kitchen, writing music, or quietly planning world domination.
