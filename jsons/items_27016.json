Led by industry professionals, dedicated sessions will address the creative process, orchestrating, conducting, music editing, and MIDI mockups. Participants can opt for one of two tracks - orchestral or hybrid - and choose a clip from a selection of rough cuts, representing a variety of genres. The workshop will culminate in a full day of recording sessions at NYU state of the art facilities, featuring New York City's top-tier studio musicians. Previous workshops included players from the NY Philharmonic and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.    Hybrid Scoring Track    The Hybrid Scoring Track recognizes that big changes have taken place in production methods for film scoring over the last 20 years which have effected not only the means of production, but the aesthetic. Most music for modern media production takes place within the composers studio. The composer is able to realize their vision from inception thru completion using a DAW and a microphone. We'll examine techniques for finessing your sound and workflow to meet the demands of modern film composition. Both Hybrid and Classic Hollywood tracks will share sessions on music editing, spotting and panels on scoring. The Hybrid Track will add to this process sampling, recording of specialists and mixing. Our acoustic recording sessions will feature first call soloists David Weiss on woodwinds ( The Rookie , Noah , Lion King ) and John Benthal on guitar (Idina Menzel, Nanny Diaries , Lion King ).    Classic Hollywood Scoring Track    Following in the vision and legacy of Buddy Baker, the 2014 NYU/ASCAP Foundation Film Scoring Workshop will continue to present the rich traditions of classical Hollywood film scoring. Dedicated sessions will address the creative process, orchestrating, conducting, and MIDI mockups. Participants will choose a clip from a selection of rough cuts, representing a variety of genres. The workshop will culminate in a full day of recording sessions, featuring New York City's top-tier studio musicians. Previous workshops included players from the NY Philharmonic and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and have been recorded by such top flight engineers as Paul Geluso and Lawrence Manchester.    Faculty    The workshop is taught by some of today&rsquo;s most creative composers and orchestrators, led by Sean Callery ( Homeland , Elementary ) and Michael Levine ( Cold Case , Close to Home ). Veteran core faculty member Mark Snow ( X-Files , Blue Bloods ) and NYU Film Scoring faculty member Ira Newborn ( Naked Gun series) will be featured. Other participating NYU faculty include Mike Patterson , Mark Suozzo , Todd Kasow, and Ron Sadoff . The ASCAP Foundation and the Society of Composers and Lyricists, with SCL President and veteran composer Dan Foliart ( 7th Heaven ), will headline additional presentations on the art and business of film music.

Led by industry professionals, dedicated sessions will address the creative process, orchestrating, conducting, music editing, and MIDI mockups. Participants can opt for one of two tracks - orchestral or hybrid - and choose a clip from a selection of rough cuts, representing a variety of genres. The workshop will culminate in a full day of recording sessions at NYU state of the art facilities, featuring New York City's top-tier studio musicians. Previous workshops included players from the NY Philharmonic and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.    Hybrid Scoring Track    The Hybrid Scoring Track recognizes that big changes have taken place in production methods for film scoring over the last 20 years which have effected not only the means of production, but the aesthetic. Most music for modern media production takes place within the composers studio. The composer is able to realize their vision from inception thru completion using a DAW and a microphone. We'll examine techniques for finessing your sound and workflow to meet the demands of modern film composition. Both Hybrid and Classic Hollywood tracks will share sessions on music editing, spotting and panels on scoring. The Hybrid Track will add to this process sampling, recording of specialists and mixing. Our acoustic recording sessions will feature first call soloists David Weiss on woodwinds ( The Rookie , Noah , Lion King ) and John Benthal on guitar (Idina Menzel, Nanny Diaries , Lion King ).    Classic Hollywood Scoring Track    Following in the vision and legacy of Buddy Baker, the 2014 NYU/ASCAP Foundation Film Scoring Workshop will continue to present the rich traditions of classical Hollywood film scoring. Dedicated sessions will address the creative process, orchestrating, conducting, and MIDI mockups. Participants will choose a clip from a selection of rough cuts, representing a variety of genres. The workshop will culminate in a full day of recording sessions, featuring New York City's top-tier studio musicians. Previous workshops included players from the NY Philharmonic and The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and have been recorded by such top flight engineers as Paul Geluso and Lawrence Manchester.    Faculty    The workshop is taught by some of today&rsquo;s most creative composers and orchestrators, led by Sean Callery ( Homeland , Elementary ) and Michael Levine ( Cold Case , Close to Home ). Veteran core faculty member Mark Snow ( X-Files , Blue Bloods ) and NYU Film Scoring faculty member Ira Newborn ( Naked Gun series) will be featured. Other participating NYU faculty include Mike Patterson , Mark Suozzo , Todd Kasow, and Ron Sadoff . The ASCAP Foundation and the Society of Composers and Lyricists, with SCL President and veteran composer Dan Foliart ( 7th Heaven ), will headline additional presentations on the art and business of film music.
