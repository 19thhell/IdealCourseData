She holds an AB in English from Vassar College, an MA in History from the University of Texas at Austin, and PhD in History from the University of Michigan. She has been teaching at NYU since January, 1995.      Her research focuses on the history of slavery, race, and revolution in Latin America, with a particular interest in the history of Cuba, Haiti, and the Caribbean. She is also interested in questions of historical method, archives, and historical writing. Her first book, Insurgent Cuba: Race, Nation, and Revolution, 1868-1898 (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), explored the history of racism and antiracism in Cuba\u2019s wars of independence, in which slaves and former slaves were majority participants. It received the 2000 Berkshire Book Prize for the best first book by a woman in any field of history. A French translation was published by P\u00e9rseides (Paris) in 2010 and Spanish translation by Editorial de Ciencias Sociales (Havana) in 2011. Her second book, Freedom\u2019s Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution, was published by Cambridge University Press in December 2014. The book examines the links between the Haitian Revolution in Saint-Domingue and the entrenchment of slavery in colonial Cuba. It received Honorable Mention for the PROSE Award in European and World History, 2015. She continues to work on the 1812 antislavery conspiracy led by free black carpenter in Havana, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aponte, while also doing research on several other projects on C.L.R. James, Antonio Maceo, C\u00e1diz, and Maine (the state, not the ship).      She teaches undergraduate and graduate courses on the history of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Cuba, as well as colloquia on a range of topics from comparative slavery, Afro-Latin America, the Haitian Revolution and the Atlantic World, and comparative revolution, among other topics.
