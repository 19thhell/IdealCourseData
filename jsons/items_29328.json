This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

It will focus on the how environmental health issues are defined and approached by civic groups, governmental officials and researchers. It will highlight how environmental threats come to the attention of the public and weigh the options for addressing these threats. Finally, it will underscore the need for multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding these threats and crafting solutions. We will focus on prevention of environmentally mediated diseases and discuss challenges to effective prevention.                                                              UGPH-GU 60 Undergraduate Experiential Learning in Global Public Health                               The global health undergraduate internship has a three-fold goal: It: 1) broadens the student\u2019s exposure to public health issues, 2) facilitates opportunities for student\u2019s to observe public health work and leadership in action, and 3) increases the student\u2019s knowledge of specific career opportunities. The internship is a semester long course where the student engages in fieldwork (a minimum of 90 hours) and attends in-class seminar sessions. The integration of didactic and practice experiences provide the student with opportunities to critically reflect on the fieldwork experience, complete a public health project that is mutually beneficial to the student and the organization, and synthesize public health knowledge, skills, and attitudes.                              Global Public Health Electives        The following courses may be used to satisfy the elective requirement for the global public health major. Please note that the relevant electives use to fulfill the requirement may be taken either through the GPH major (starting with UGPH-GU) or through the major department).                                                  UGPH-GU 80 Public Health Entrepreneurial Ventures                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: UGPH-GU 30 and UGPH-GU 40   A new GIPH course focused on creating sustainable and scalable Public Health business models, either as stand-alone entities or within a larger corporation. Teams of undergraduate students will explore specific Public Health needs that can be addressed via innovative, entrepreneurial ventures and gain increased business and entrepreneurship skills in a Public Health context.                                                              UGPH-GU 90 Topics in Public Health: Controversies and Debates                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: none   The provocative controversy as to whether New York City should ban sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces to lower rates of obesity and diabetes is merely the latest example of the ongoing historical debate over how we should be best protect the public\u2019s health while respecting civil liberties. Modern public health began with the sanitation movement in England in the mid-nineteenth century. Since then, health officials have instituted mandatory vaccine programs, detained infectious patients and passed laws to limit smoking, change people\u2019s diets and mandate traffic safety measures. Despite the improved health that these measures have helped to produce, industry, politicians and libertarian critics have opposed aspects of these initiatives using the mantle of preserving civil rights. This class will use primary and secondary written documents as well as public-service announcements, movies and documentaries to explore how these issues have been characterized and debated in the United States over the past 150 years. Have specific groups in society been unfairly stigmatized by public health efforts? Do we have the right to compel \u201cbetter\u201d behaviors if people are only hurting themselves and not others? Did health officials deliberately exaggerate the dangers of \u201csecond-hand smoke\u201d to get stricter anti-smoking laws passed? Why do we call drunk driving crashes \u201caccidents\u201d when the behavior of drunk drivers is not at all accidental? This course will be multidisciplinary in its attention not only to modern public health debates and their historical precedents but also to the ethical and medical issues raised.

In the first part of the course, the seminar engages students in discussion about the aims and content of research on public health topics, and students develop research questions to pursue. In the second part of the course, working closely with faculty, students undertake a research project, completing an honors thesis as the final product.                                                              UGPH-GU 158 History of Medicine                               Fall semester  4 credits  Pre-requisites: none  cross-listed with HIST-UA 158   This seminar will explore the immense historical importance of infectious disease, in particular, using it as a lens to confront larger issues in the changing world of medical practice and investigation. We will study the impact of disease at critical points in American history. We will discuss the great epidemics that devastated our nation, as well as the scientific breakthroughs in epidemiology, vaccines and antibiotics that tamed the scourge of cholera, polio, typhoid fever, and influenza, among other deadly diseases. We will study how the battle against disease revolutionized philanthropy and medical research in the United States. We will see the consequences and cultural impact of disease upon different segments of the American population. And we will look at current diseases yet to be fully understood or conquered, such as HIV/AIDS.

These lectures and discussions will be complemented by site visits and excursions to major historical and cultural sites. It is hoped that these talks and field trips will provide the relevant background information for students to understand some of the issues raised in their classes as well as their day-to-day encounters within their new environment. Regarding the third objective, there will be three introductory lessons in the Twi dialect of Akan, the most widely spoken local language in the country.   This course will combine talks, discussions, field trips and assignments. Four 1 - 1.5hrs guest lectures, two site visits, and two language lessons will form part of the orientation activities in WEEK 0. In the first six weeks of the semester, there will be two additional field trips and film screenings. Each student is expected to write three 2-page reaction/reflection papers on any of the talks, site visits and film documentaries.

It considers both traditional aspects of life and how people live their lives in this first decade of the new millennium. How Ghanaians perceive and conceive themselves and their society; how others view the society and life of Ghanaians also receive critical attention. The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country. The course combines talks, readings, discussions, visits, and students' presentations in class. There will be a written examination at the end of the semester and a dissertation on an aspect of Ghanaian society and culture that students might choose to explore.

Women writers have emerged at the forefront of the movement to restore African women to their proper place in the study of African history, society and culture. In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

Finally, it will underscore the need for multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding these threats and crafting solutions. We will focus on prevention of environmentally mediated diseases and discuss challenges to effective prevention.                                      History                                                  The History of the Atlantic Slave Trade - HIST-UA 9572 - 4 points                               The course examines the rise, growth, effects, and the abolition of the Atlantic Slave trade as well as its legacy. The course begins with a discussion of the nature of West African society before the introduction of the Atlantic Slave Trade; and the relations among Asante peoples, other neighboring West African peoples, the indigenous slave trade, and relations with Europeans in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The Atlantic Slave trade itself is analyzed from historical, ethnographic, sociological, economic and political perspectives, focusing on Africa, Europe and the Americas. The immediate and long term effects of the Slave Trade on Africa are considered, as well as the history of the trade's Abolition, and the legacy of the Atlantic Slave trade in African, European and American societies.

This broad perspective will be examined against the background notion that the media do not function in a vacuum. Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. As a special focus, we will examine the significance of the liberalization of the airwaves in emerging democracies such as Ghana.

The interpretative classes will run concurrently with production management, sights and sound, and post-production workshops. The course will have three objectives: (1) teach students the documentary tradition from Flaherty to Rouch; (2) use critical Cinema theory to define a document with a camera; and (3) create a short documentary film.

African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.

Four different sets of literature have been developed around this concept. The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.
