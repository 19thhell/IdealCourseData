I want you to begin mastering the tools and techniques that are required for creating and designing the future of the internet. Let's get started!   In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of web design and the basics of creating content for the internet. We will be using the latest software for web production such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, and Flash as well as HTML5 and CSS to create multi-media web content.   At the end of the semester students will understand how to use the software in a professional setting. And they will build a website of their own using the techniques and creative inspiration aquired through the course assignments, readings, and lectures.    Prerequisite   Three years of high school mathematics or equivalent. No prior computing experience is assumed. Students with computing experience should consult with the computer science department before registering. Offered every semester. 4 points.

You are not required to buy any software for this course. The Adobe programs are quite expensive. If you want to have adobe on your machine I would suggest downloading one of the 30 trial offers.  Homework for this class requires spending time in the computer lab or at your home or business working on a computer.     Exam Schedule   Midterm: Thursday October 11th  Final: TBA     Grading   Assignments: 60%  Midterm: 20%  Final Exam: 20%     Cheating   Do not allow another student to copy all or part of your homework project, or exam.  You must submit your own work.       Attendance   If you have to miss class please email the professor.  Please be on time to class.       Computer Labs   The main computer labs to use for this class are in the Third Avenue North Dorm and in the Education building. Further information on the labs is available from ITS.    Third Avenue North Lab is located at 75 Third Avenue, Level C3 (downstairs) near 12th Street.  Multimedia lab is located in the Education Building, at 35 W. 4th Street, on the second floor.      Course Computer Accounts Used in this Course (UNIX i6)   In addition to your NYU Home Account and Blackboard, we will be using a special computer account on a Unix web server!  This is called an &quot;i6&quot; account, and we will use it for our web sites.     Your i6 account will   be assigned to you automatically based upon your enrollment. You do not need to sign up for this account. You will recieve intsturctions in class on how to set up your i6 account.  You must post assignments to your i6 account.    Saving Your Work   You will be able to save your work ITS labs under your NYU Home Account and/or on your own flash drives.  Although you can write to the hard disks of the machines in the labs, you cannot be sure that you will have access to the same machine the next time you enter the lab and the drives in the lab are frequently erased. The best option is to upload your files online and download them as needed.  You may find it advantageous to visit the labs at times since there will be tutors available 20 hours per week, and other students can sometimes assist you with general features of the programs.    Help!   At times this course may feel overwhelming. If you do not understand a topic, are struggling with an assignment, feel like you are falling behind, or just don't get it.. visit me in my office hours or shoot me an email. I am here to help.  Office Hours: 11am - 12pm Tuesday and Thursday in Warren Weaver Hall Room 328   Email dkarwas @ cs.nyu.edu to schedule an appointment. Walk-in's are also welcome.  A very talented and experienced T.A. will be available at the ITS Multimedia Lab to assist the students in this class. I will know the T.A. hours after the 2nd class."}]}]
