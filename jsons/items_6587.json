Description       Philosophical aesthetics is naturally concerned with problems pertaining to the arts in general, but there are issues that must also be examined within the context of the particular arts. This course will begin with an examination of broad issues in aesthetics: What is art? What is beauty? What is expression and emotion in the arts? Is there such a thing as \u201cgood taste?\u201d We will then consider particular issues within the context of painting, photography, film, music, and the popular arts (specifically popular music and television). Some questions posed will be the following: What does it mean for a painting to be \u201cabout\u201d or to \u201cexpress\u201d something? How should we think of photography\u2014as a means by which we can actually see things and people in situations that no longer exist or as simply a means of registering the world? What is it about film that gives the medium its peculiar illusion-making power? What exactly is music? Does it represent and express in the same way as other art forms? What value is there in popular music and television? Readings will be drawn from Benjamin, Danto, Eco, Gombrich, Greenberg, Heidegger, Kant, Kivy, Plato, Scruton, and others. In addition to contributing regularly and actively to class discussions and activities, students will be required to compose frequent responses and reflections, write two formal essays (4-5 pages each), present a research proposal, and complete a final research paper (8-10 pages).

Trogan is currently working on a book on the ethics and aesthetics of suicide.

Description       What is beauty? Why is it so powerful? What attracts us to someone or something beautiful? Is beauty an objective feature of things, or is it determined by cultural context and personal preference? Although beauty inspired enormous attention from antiquity to the twentieth century, much of modern art, literature, and philosophy considered beauty insignificant and, in some cases, even reacted vehemently against it. This course recognizes the significance of beauty and its enormous influence on our lives. It approaches the issue through an examination of the way in which philosophers, artists, writers, psychologists, cultural historians, and biologists have understood the term. It also considers the intersection of beauty and politics. Texts may include works by Arthur Danto, Charles Baudelaire, Immanuel Kant, Thomas Mann, Plato, Nancy Etcoff, Susan Bordo, and other contemporary figures.

Description       Philosophical aesthetics is naturally concerned with problems pertaining to the arts in general, but there are issues that must also be examined within the context of the particular arts. This course will begin with an examination of broad issues in aesthetics: What is art? What is beauty? What is expression and emotion in the arts? Is there such a thing as \u201cgood taste?\u201d We will then consider particular issues within the context of painting, photography, film, music, and the popular arts (specifically popular music and television). Some questions posed will be the following: What does it mean for a painting to be \u201cabout\u201d or to \u201cexpress\u201d something? How should we think of photography\u2014as a means by which we can actually see things and people in situations that no longer exist or as simply a means of registering the world? What is it about film that gives the medium its peculiar illusion-making power? What exactly is music? Does it represent and express in the same way as other art forms? What value is there in popular music and television? Readings will be drawn from Benjamin, Danto, Eco, Gombrich, Greenberg, Heidegger, Kant, Kivy, Plato, Scruton, and others. In addition to contributing regularly and actively to class discussions and activities, students will be required to compose frequent responses and reflections, write two formal essays (4-5 pages each), present a research proposal, and complete a final research paper (8-10 pages).

Description       What is beauty? Why is it so powerful? What attracts us to someone or something beautiful? Is beauty an objective feature of things, or is it determined by cultural context and personal preference? Although beauty inspired enormous attention from antiquity to the twentieth century, much of modern art, literature, and philosophy considered beauty insignificant and, in some cases, even reacted vehemently against it. This course recognizes the significance of beauty and its enormous influence on our lives. It approaches the issue through an examination of the way in which philosophers, artists, writers, psychologists, cultural historians, and biologists have understood the term. It also considers the intersection of beauty and politics. Texts may include works by Arthur Danto, Charles Baudelaire, Immanuel Kant, Thomas Mann, Plato, Nancy Etcoff, Susan Bordo, and other contemporary figures.
