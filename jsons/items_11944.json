But poems have to be achieved; they're compositions at work in the everyday. Here I trace the compositional qualities of some matter poems; a New Hampshire comprised of walks, a school assembly, New England Red. In all such moments, something throws itself together. A tendency, an icon, a color, a groove of habit or hope, or a rhythm or chaos of living becomes legible. This ordinary artfulness calls for new forms of critique - a vitalist critique to bring things to life, a slow critique to watch grass grow, a basic practice of curiosity and experimentation, a critique faced with an overabundance of things to be known, described or imagined.      Kathleen Stewart is Professor of Anthropology, The University of Texas-Austin. She writes and teaches on affect, the ordinary, worlding, the senses, and modes of ethnographic engagement driven by curiosity and attachment. Her work is an experiment that writes from the intensities in things. It asks what potential modes of knowing, relating, or attending to things are already being lived in ordinary rhythms, labors, and the sensory materiality of forms of attunement to worlds. Her first book A Space on the Side of the Road: Cultural Poetics in an \"Other\" America (Princeton University Press, 1996) portrays a dense and textured layering of sense and form laid down in social use. Ordinary Affect (Duke University Press, 2007) traces the force of encounters, desires, bodily states, dream worlds, and modes of attention and distraction in the composition and suffering of a present.      Her current project, Atmospheric Attunements, presents a collective sensing out lived in the mode of potentiality. A sensorium attuned to atmospherics grapples not only with things or power, but with the world-a worlding.
