The taken-for-granted world is invisible except under special   conditions--when boredom is induced by the sheer repetitiveness of the banal   or when poesis transforms the utterly ordinary or when the shock of the sensational,   spectacular, or exotic calls the taken-for-granted into question.   Debates over the creative and emancipatory potential of vernacular   culture will move us towards a critical theory of everyday life. A close reading   of key thinkers such as de Certeau, Williams, Hall, and Harvey will frame our   fine-grained analyses of the urban mise-en-scene in New York City, its spatial   and temporal organization, its concentrations of power and oppositional practices,   its performative modes and values.   We will examine the phantasmagoria of New York city streets and   open spaces (Washington Square, Times Square); the vernacular imprint on the   built environment (graffiti, sidewalk altars, casitas, vendors, Christmas lights);   the festivalizing of the city (Easter Parade, and Hasidic Purim in Brooklyn);   home and homelessness; death in the vernacular, including memorial walls in   various New York City neighborhoods, and the role of tourism, museums, and performance   artists in constituting the quotidian. We will also consider technology in everyday   life, particularly the social worlds emerging in cyberspace. Where possible,   fieldtrips will be organized to relevant events and parts of the city.     Research Essay   Examine in depth a cultural setting or event in New York. Focus   on one of the issues raised in the course. Photography and video/sound recording   are strongly encouraged. Essays based on fieldwork are strongly encouraged..   Historical research using primary sources is also appropriate. Essays should   combine thick description with analysis that addresses theoretical issues raised   in the course. Mechanics of the paper must be under control--copyediting, proofreading,   consistent formatting of footnotes and bibliography. Students are encouraged   to use this assignment as a pilot project for the masters essay or doctoral   dissertation, and to think in terms of presenting this work at the October 2000   meetings of the American Folklore Society meetings in Anchorage, Alaska (deadlines   for submissions are fast approaching), November 2000 meetings of the American   Studies Association, and April 2001 PSi Conference in Munich, among others.   Collaborative projects are strongly encouraged. Due Wednesday   April 26 .   Research Essay Proposal   We will discuss project ideas in class and in the class newsgroup.   In addition, you are encouraged to brainstorm ideas with me during office hours   and by email. The topic should be settled and you should already have begun   working on it when you submit the proposal. The proposal (2-3 pages, double-spaced)   should demonstrate a good match between the case you will analyze and the conceptual   focus and theoretical orientation you will use. Show how you will gain access   to your subject and explain what you have already done by way of preparation.   List the relevant reading, indictating what you have already read. Provide a   provisional outline for the paper. Or, alternatively, treat this proposal like   you would the long abstract that you are asked to submit when you volunteer   a paper for a conference.

These reports will be formal conference presentations--5   minutes (2 1/2 typed pages) in length--and will also be handed in. This will   be the last day of class.
