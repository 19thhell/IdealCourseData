Carter Journalism Institute.   \u201cSince the FDA\u2019s evidence of misconduct -- even of fraud -- seldom makes its way into the peer-reviewed literature, researchers and doctors are unaware that they\u2019re making life-and-death decisions based upon experiments whose reliability has been called into question,\u201d explains Professor Charles Seife, the study\u2019s author.   The findings appear in the latest issue of JAMA Internal Medicine .   The research stems from an investigative reporting class Seife teaches at the Carter Journalism Institute. Students enrolled in the Institute\u2019s Science, Health, and Environmental Reporting (SHERP) program participated in the research by matching FDA inspections with subsequent peer-reviewed articles.   The FDA classifies its inspections based on the severity of the violations that are found; the most severe is \u201cofficial action indicated (OAI),\u201d which means objectionable conditions or practices were found that warrant regulatory action. During the 2013 fiscal year, about 2 percent of the 644 inspections the FDA carried out at trial sites were classified as OAI, according to background information in the study.   Seife and his students identified published clinical trials where an FDA inspection found significant problems and determined whether there was mention of it in peer-reviewed medical literature.    The researchers identified 57 published clinical trials where an FDA inspection found one or more of the following problems: falsification or submission of false information, 22 trials (39 percent); problems with adverse events reporting, 14 trials (25 percent); protocol violations, 42 trials, (74 percent); inadequate or inaccurate recordkeeping, 35 trials (61 percent); failure to protect the safety of patients and/or issues with oversight or informed consent, 30 trials (53 percent); and violations that were not otherwise characterized, 20 trials (35 percent). Only three of the 78 publications (4 percent) that resulted from the trials where the FDA found significant violations mentioned the objectionable conditions or practices.    \u201cThe FDA does not typically notify journals when a site participating in a published clinical trial receives an OAI inspection, nor does it generally make any announcement intended to alert the public about the research misconduct that it finds,\u201d the study concludes. \u201cThe documents the agency discloses tend to be heavily redacted. As a result, it is usually very difficult, or even impossible, to determine which published clinical trials are implicated by the FDA\u2019s allegations of research misconduct.\u201d   For a podcast of Seife discussing the findings, please click here .

Carter Journalism Institute.   \u201cSince the FDA\u2019s evidence of misconduct -- even of fraud -- seldom makes its way into the peer-reviewed literature, researchers and doctors are unaware that they\u2019re making life-and-death decisions based upon experiments whose reliability has been called into question,\u201d explains Professor Charles Seife, the study\u2019s author.   The findings appear in the latest issue of JAMA Internal Medicine .   The research stems from an investigative reporting class Seife teaches at the Carter Journalism Institute. Students enrolled in the Institute\u2019s Science, Health, and Environmental Reporting (SHERP) program participated in the research by matching FDA inspections with subsequent peer-reviewed articles.   The FDA classifies its inspections based on the severity of the violations that are found; the most severe is \u201cofficial action indicated (OAI),\u201d which means objectionable conditions or practices were found that warrant regulatory action. During the 2013 fiscal year, about 2 percent of the 644 inspections the FDA carried out at trial sites were classified as OAI, according to background information in the study.   Seife and his students identified published clinical trials where an FDA inspection found significant problems and determined whether there was mention of it in peer-reviewed medical literature.    The researchers identified 57 published clinical trials where an FDA inspection found one or more of the following problems: falsification or submission of false information, 22 trials (39 percent); problems with adverse events reporting, 14 trials (25 percent); protocol violations, 42 trials, (74 percent); inadequate or inaccurate recordkeeping, 35 trials (61 percent); failure to protect the safety of patients and/or issues with oversight or informed consent, 30 trials (53 percent); and violations that were not otherwise characterized, 20 trials (35 percent). Only three of the 78 publications (4 percent) that resulted from the trials where the FDA found significant violations mentioned the objectionable conditions or practices.    \u201cThe FDA does not typically notify journals when a site participating in a published clinical trial receives an OAI inspection, nor does it generally make any announcement intended to alert the public about the research misconduct that it finds,\u201d the study concludes. \u201cThe documents the agency discloses tend to be heavily redacted. As a result, it is usually very difficult, or even impossible, to determine which published clinical trials are implicated by the FDA\u2019s allegations of research misconduct.\u201d   For a podcast of Seife discussing the findings, please click here .
