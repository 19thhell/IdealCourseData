The writing service provides any NYU in London student with one-to-one writing related assistance (subject to availability). Ben East and Nicky Wilcox are the EAP tutors at NYU in London, offering individual tutorials for students whose first language is not English. The tutorials are intended to provide support with any issues relating to grammar, vocabulary, and appropriate academic style such as questions of structure and flow of an academic argument.   Making an Appointment       Spring15 EAP tutorials at NYU in London are available Monday through Thursday, except during Fall Break and exam week.   Appointments with Ben East take place in Room 103A and appointments with Nicky Willcox take place in Room G05.     Tutorials can be booked at https://nyu.mywconline.net and usually last for one hour. You will need to register on your first visit.   When you are booking your EAP tutorial, please ensure you select EAP Writing Tutors schedule.     Try to schedule your appointment in advance of the due date for your paper so the you will have ample time revise/rewrite after the session.   You may schedule one appointment per week. You can book an appointment up to two weeks in advance.   Session times are subject to change.     Waiting List   If you cannot find an available appointment for your preferred day or time, please use the online booking system's waiting list. The system will automatically send you an email when an appointment becomes available.   Getting the Most Out of Your Appointment   How to prepare for your session:     If you are working on a draft bring two copies of it, one for you and one for the writing tutor.   If your writing concern is related to a particular assignment, bring the assignment instructions.   If you want to discuss feedback you have received from a teacher, bring a copy of the comments     Prior to the session, reread your draft and your assignment to determine what particular question, concern, or issue you would like to take up during the session.   What to Expect   The aim of the service is to equip you with the tools you need in order to produce more effective, accurate English independently.   You should expect to select one of two problematic passages from your essay, and use these as a starting point for a diagnosis and discussion of your more general problems with the language. Your tutor with read the passage(s) you have selected and highlight the main area of concern (for example, errors with articles, prepositions, tenses or an insufficiently academic choice of vocabulary). In each case, you will be told why your language is incorrect, but your essay will not be corrected for you. Instead you will be guided towards a general understanding of the appropriate grammar rule, or asked to consider an alternative selection of vocabulary   If you have concerns about the structure of your essay or the flow if your argument, you will be encouraged to group your existing ideas, and discuss ways of reorganising and presenting them logically.   During the session, your tutor will take notes on the nature of the issues you have covered, and note down any passages from your essay which have been analysed. After the session, a report will be sent to any relevant tutors. This will help them to see what help you have received, and what kind or errors to look out for in your future work.   Please bear in mind that the aim of our service is to equip you with the tools you need in order to produce more effective, accurate English independently. If you use the service as it is intended to be used, you should find over the course of several sessions that you are able to form a comprehensive editing 'checklist' of your most common problems, together with useful strategies for addressing them in your future work. This approach will be of far more value to you in the long term that a quick fix solution of having your corrected for you without an explanation of your errors.   What not to Expect   Please note that the EAP support sessions do not constitute a proof reading or editing service. Your tutor will not 'fix' your essay for you. You should not expect an appraisal of the content/argument of your work.   Attendance and Cancellation Policies   Because the EAP service is often busy or over-subscribed. there are strict attendance and cancellation policies.   If you miss more that one scheduled appointment but forgot to cancel it, you will not be allowed to visit an EAP tutor again during the semester.   Appointments may be cancelled up to 48 hours in advance of your scheduled slot. This gives other students a fair amount of warning, enabling them to take your place.   If you are more than ten minutes late for your appointment, you will lose your session to a student on the waiting list.   Self-Study   You will get the most out of your appointment only if you follow it up with careful revision and self-study.   There are many good guides on improving your English.   Raymond Murphy's English Grammar in Use is very accessible, and your tutor is likely to recommend that you buy a copy. Its units on articles and tenses are particularly helpful.

The writing service provides any NYU in London student with one-to-one writing related assistance (subject to availability). Ben East and Nicky Wilcox are the EAP tutors at NYU in London, offering individual tutorials for students whose first language is not English. The tutorials are intended to provide support with any issues relating to grammar, vocabulary, and appropriate academic style such as questions of structure and flow of an academic argument.   Making an Appointment       Spring15 EAP tutorials at NYU in London are available Monday through Thursday, except during Fall Break and exam week.   Appointments with Ben East take place in Room 103A and appointments with Nicky Willcox take place in Room G05.     Tutorials can be booked at https://nyu.mywconline.net and usually last for one hour. You will need to register on your first visit.   When you are booking your EAP tutorial, please ensure you select EAP Writing Tutors schedule.     Try to schedule your appointment in advance of the due date for your paper so the you will have ample time revise/rewrite after the session.   You may schedule one appointment per week. You can book an appointment up to two weeks in advance.   Session times are subject to change.     Waiting List   If you cannot find an available appointment for your preferred day or time, please use the online booking system's waiting list. The system will automatically send you an email when an appointment becomes available.   Getting the Most Out of Your Appointment   How to prepare for your session:     If you are working on a draft bring two copies of it, one for you and one for the writing tutor.   If your writing concern is related to a particular assignment, bring the assignment instructions.   If you want to discuss feedback you have received from a teacher, bring a copy of the comments     Prior to the session, reread your draft and your assignment to determine what particular question, concern, or issue you would like to take up during the session.   What to Expect   The aim of the service is to equip you with the tools you need in order to produce more effective, accurate English independently.   You should expect to select one of two problematic passages from your essay, and use these as a starting point for a diagnosis and discussion of your more general problems with the language. Your tutor with read the passage(s) you have selected and highlight the main area of concern (for example, errors with articles, prepositions, tenses or an insufficiently academic choice of vocabulary). In each case, you will be told why your language is incorrect, but your essay will not be corrected for you. Instead you will be guided towards a general understanding of the appropriate grammar rule, or asked to consider an alternative selection of vocabulary   If you have concerns about the structure of your essay or the flow if your argument, you will be encouraged to group your existing ideas, and discuss ways of reorganising and presenting them logically.   During the session, your tutor will take notes on the nature of the issues you have covered, and note down any passages from your essay which have been analysed. After the session, a report will be sent to any relevant tutors. This will help them to see what help you have received, and what kind or errors to look out for in your future work.   Please bear in mind that the aim of our service is to equip you with the tools you need in order to produce more effective, accurate English independently. If you use the service as it is intended to be used, you should find over the course of several sessions that you are able to form a comprehensive editing 'checklist' of your most common problems, together with useful strategies for addressing them in your future work. This approach will be of far more value to you in the long term that a quick fix solution of having your corrected for you without an explanation of your errors.   What not to Expect   Please note that the EAP support sessions do not constitute a proof reading or editing service. Your tutor will not 'fix' your essay for you. You should not expect an appraisal of the content/argument of your work.   Attendance and Cancellation Policies   Because the EAP service is often busy or over-subscribed. there are strict attendance and cancellation policies.   If you miss more that one scheduled appointment but forgot to cancel it, you will not be allowed to visit an EAP tutor again during the semester.   Appointments may be cancelled up to 48 hours in advance of your scheduled slot. This gives other students a fair amount of warning, enabling them to take your place.   If you are more than ten minutes late for your appointment, you will lose your session to a student on the waiting list.   Self-Study   You will get the most out of your appointment only if you follow it up with careful revision and self-study.   There are many good guides on improving your English.   Raymond Murphy's English Grammar in Use is very accessible, and your tutor is likely to recommend that you buy a copy. Its units on articles and tenses are particularly helpful.
