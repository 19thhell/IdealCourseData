The program complements doctoral or master\u2019s students\u2019 work in their home departments with interdisciplinary study of the broad range of culture in the medieval and early modern periods, as well as of the theories and methods that attend them. The Concentration is designed to train specialists who are firmly based in a traditional discipline but who can work across disciplinary boundaries, making use of varied theoretical approaches and methodological practices. Curriculum The Concentration consists of twenty credits, all of which will also count towards a student\u2019s graduate degree, distributed under the following rubrics: Proseminar in Medieval and Renaissance Studies (4 points); Medieval and Renaissance Media: Visual and Material Cultures (4 points); Late Latin and Early Vernaculars (4 points); and Medieval and Renaissance Studies Workshop (2 points per semester taken twice in an academic year). At least one course must be taken outside a student\u2019s home department. In addition, students pursuing the Concentration will present a paper at least once either in the Workshop or in a conference offered by the Medieval and Renaissance Center. Core Course Descriptions Proseminar  \u2013 MEDI-GA 1100 An introduction to the primary materials, reference works, journals, and research methodologies that pertain to the field of Medieval and Renaissance Studies together with an introduction to its sub-disciplines, including religion, psychology and philosophy, secular art and literature, architecture, historiography, economics and trade, science, translation studies, and the history of the book. The course is team taught. Medieval &amp; Renaissance Studies Workshop \u2013 MEDI-GA 2000 A forum for cultivating the interdisciplinary work of students working in the medieval and early modern periods and for preparing students to meet the demands of the professional world of Medieval and Renaissance Studies. Workshop activities will include discussing and critiquing per-circulated papers or works-in-progress presented by NYU faculty, visiting scholars, and members of the Workshop; learning and practicing the protocols for submitting papers for conferences and various forms of publication, and for writing grant proposals; designing teaching strategies; and discovering and experimenting with new research tools. In all of these activities Workshop participants will also engage with overarching issues of concern to the field such as the benefits and limitations of periodization and the role of Medieval and Renaissance Studies in the academy and in society at large. Medieval Latin and Early Vernaculars \u2013 MEDI-GA 2100 This course has two aims: to improve students' ability to read and translate medieval Latin, and to increase students' understanding and appreciation of medieval Latin literature. Students will read selections from a variety of Latin texts, of which the earliest author is Boethius and the latest author is Dante. The study of poetic selections will include attention to meter.

But, for contemporary medievalists, hagiography is far from limited to the study of the church and its history. The hagriographical literature, which often describes a saint's life in graphic detail, is a vital source for medieval social, cultural and intellectual history - for the character of everyday life in the Middle Ages, the values and the tools, both intellectual and physical, with which medievals confronted life's challenges. Hagiographical texts have, for instance, been a vital tool for examining the lives of medieval women, of the peasantry, the urban proletariat and a host of topics that are generally invisible or opaque in the documentary and traditional literary sources.   The essential tool for medieval hagiography is the Acta Sanctorum [see below], the monumental, 68-volume aggregation of saints lives that has been amassed by group of scholars and philologists known as the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bollandistes , names for Jean Bolland (1596-1665), the early modern Jesuit who took up the collection of saints lives first undertaken by Herbert Rosweyde (1569-1629). The journal of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; is: Analecta Bollandiana: Revue critique d'hagiographie . It has been published since 1882 and is a vital resource for the field. The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; also publishes an important monographic series, Subsidia Hagiographica . The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; has also recently begun to publish editions of the correspondence of the Bollandists and the various scholars with whom they collaborated in the series, Tabularium Hagiographicum .   The resources below, including the Acta , provide the basic tools for hagiographical research.

Medieval manuscripts can be found in several ways:     There are a few online collections of digitized medieval manuscripts, which are listed at right.    You may have a citation provided by another scholar, which will take the form of the repository and the manuscript's shelfmark - e.g. the so-called Codex Vaticanus, one of the oldest manuscripts of the Greek Bible, is in the Vatican Library's Greek manuscript collection and would be cited as: Vat. gr. 1209.    Most large repositories have produced published manuscript catalogues, which list their holdings and give brief descriptions. A few of these catalogues have been put online and are listed at right. The finest collection of printed manuscript catalogues in the U.S. is uptown in Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library.   The essential guide to catalogues of Latin manuscripts is: Paul Oskar Kristeller, Latin manuscript books before 1600: a list of the printed catalogues and unpublished inventories of extant collections - fourth revised and enlarged edition by Sigrid Kr&auml;mer (Munich, Monumenta Germaniae Historica, 1993). A supplement edited by Kr&auml;mer and Birgit Christine Arensmann appeared in 2007. They are in the Bobst collection at Z6605.L3 K75 1993 and Z6601.A1 K68 2007 respectively. An online edition is available from the MGH .   Also essential for scholars of Renaissance manuscripts is Kristeller's Iter Italicum;a finding list of uncatalogued or incompletely catalogued humanistic manuscripts of the Renaissance in Italian and other libraries, 6 vols. ( London : Warburg Institute, 1963-1997 ). It is available in the 1st-floor Reference Center of Bobst Libary at: Z6611.H8 K7.

Curiously the latter can often be more difficult to find than the former, as the Vatican largely closed access to its own archive - the so-called Secret Archives - in the 17th century and didn't begin to make its contents available to researchers until the late-19th century. For the middle ages, registers of papal documents - i.e. compilations of copies retained by the papacy and subsequently published - are extant from the pontificates of Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) and for two earlier pontiffs, Gregory I (590-604) and Gregory VII (1173-1085), with fragmentary registers available for a few others. The central effort of 20th-century scholars to provide critical texts of pre-1198 papal documents has taken its impetus from a project proposed by Paul Fridolin Kehr in 1896 - to comb the libraries and archives of Europe (and eventually the world) - for manuscripts of papal documents. Since 1931 much of this effort has been underwritten by a trust, the Pius-Stiftung f&uuml;r Papsturkunden, and the consequent work is often simply termed \"the Papsturkunden Project,\" the publications of which are listed below. But a broad array of documentary resources is available, and some effort has been made to give it coherence for NYU researchers below.   Note: For papal letters of the 13th and 14th centuries, the first resource is the Brepols full-text database, Ut per litteras apostolicas , which provides access to the papal documents of the Secret Archives of that period.

Miscellaneous Collections of Papal Documents - Both Medieval & Modern                 Note: A number of bullaria assembled during the early-modern period can still be of use, though some are now quite rare. An excellent review of this literature is to be found in the article, \"Bullaire\", in the Dictionnaire de theologie catholique, vol. 2, which presents a particularly useful list of specialized bullaria relating to individual ecclesiastical orders, etc.     Among the general bullaria , the following are perhaps the most important:       Carafa, Antonio. Epistolae decretales summorum pontificum . 3 vols. Rome, 1591. - this first of the great  bullaria was to have contained not only papal documents but all associated materials: imperial letters, conciliar documents et al. Carara's death left a collection containing only papal documents from Clement I (90-99) to Gregory VII (1073-1085). It is extremely rare.     Cherubini, Laerzia et al. Magnum bullarium Romanum, a Beato Leone Magno usque ad S. D. N. Benedict um XIII . 10 vols. Luxembourg, 1727-30. - This great collection, undertaken initially by Cherubini in 1586 and continued in expanded editions by his son, Angelo Maria Cherubini and other, contains bulls from the pontificate of Leo the Great (440) through Benedict XIII (1724-30). A 19-volume edition in 1741-43 took the collection up to the pontificate of Benedict XIV. All editions are quite rare.     Coustant, Pierre. Epistolae romanorum pontificum, et quae ad eos scriptae sunt, a sancto Clemente I usque ad Innocentium III. .. Paris, 1721. - only the first volume of this great set appeared, treating documents from the period 67-440. It contains extensive notes assessing the authenticity of the documents presented and evidence for those that were lost.     Gaude, Francisco &amp; Luigi Tomaassetti. Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum romanorum pontificum taurinensis . 25 vols. Augustae Taurinorum, 1857-1872. - This \"new\" edition of Girolamo Mainard's and Charles Cocquelines'  Magnum bullarium romanum (Rome, 1739-62) is by no means comprehensive, containing only a miscellany of papal documents. But it is the largest of the early modern collections and was grounded in the originals located in the Vatican's Secret Archives. Volumes 1-24 present documents from the pontificates of Leo I (440-461) through Clement XII (1730-40), and the 25th volume is an appendix containing additional documents from Leo I-Pelagius II (579-590).The preponderance of documents, contained in vols. 6-24, are from the 16th-18th centuries. - There is a copy at Columbia University in the Ancient &amp; Medieval Studies Reading Room.

I've provided a list below some useful bibliographic sources for finding translations, and I've also provided below a list of published print and electronic books in the NYU Libraries that gather medieval documents in translation. There is a long list of such aggregations and other sites featuring both original-language and translated texts on the \"Full Text Primary Sources\" tab of this guide - particularly the column of \"Free Full-Text Resources on the Internet.\" But be aware - many of the translations on these sites are editions out of copyright, which is why they can be put up freely on the Web, but which also means many of the translations are old and may be based on poor editions of the original text. Many are also abridgements of the original text and so may not contain all of the content you are seeking.      The best way to find more authoritative translations of medieval primary sources is by searching the library's catalog, BobCat. Search by the name of the author, or, if the work either does not have an author or you are looking for a specific work by a particular author, search under the title. Once you have pulled up a list of results in BobCat, look in the \"Refine My Results\" column and limit the search results to English-language materials. Be aware, library catalogs are often very specific in the way they list the translated version of a medieval author's name or the name of a source. For instance, searching \"Giraldus Cambrensis\" and \"Gerald of Wales\" turns up the same list of works in BobCat, but searching for \"Girald of Wales\" yields nothing. Searching \"Chanson de Roland\" yields many more items than searching \"Song of Roland.\" When you've found one item by a particular author, look in the \"details\" screen to see the link to the proper spelling of his or her name and click on that.                                              Bibliographies of Sources in Translation                  Bibliography of English translations from medieval sources, 1943-1967 There is also a paper edition of this older work in the Bobst stacks at: Z6517 .F47. Sadly, a Stanford University effort to supplement this with a bibliography of translations published after 1967 is no longer available.
