Comments (0)                                         Data Management Plans and Data Sharing                 As of January 2011, The National Science Foundation (NSF) requires that new grant proposals include an appendix that describes plans for the management of research data. Such Data Management Plans (DMPs) will be evaluated as part of the grant proposal. The NSF maintains a policy on the dissemination and sharing of research data that requires investigators to, among other things, facilitate the sharing of data that results from work supported by NSF grants. More on this policy can be found here . While the NSF requirement is not new, recent years have seen a renewed emphasis on data sharing and many other federal agencies also require some form of data management plan to accompany grant proposals.   According to the Code of Federal Regulations , research data is, \"... defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues.\"   There are a number of things to consider when sharing data and developing a data management plan. Among them are the accommodation of legal and ethical requirements that protect confidentiality and personal information, the choices of metadata standards and description mechanisms that make data usable to other researchers and the enumeration of usage policies that governs the use of data. This guide serves as a resource for researchers who seek further understanding of data management and sharing or wish to avail themselves of NYU resources with respect to the same.   The NSF has provided a list of answers to frequently asked questions to further illuminate the requirements that undergird their data management appendix but these answers are applicable in many instances.

Comments (0)                                         Welcome                 Many key granting organizations, like NSF, NIH, NEH and more, now require submitters to include a Data Management Plan as part of their application. In short, these plans outline what steps the applicant will take to collect, safeguard, archive, and make available the data used for the research in question.     This guide lays out practical considerations and information to aid you in preparing your Data Management Plan, and leads you to a Data Management Plan Tool that you can use to create your plan.

Why are they asking me for a Data Management Plan?                 The National Science Foundation maintains a policy on the dissemination and sharing of research data that requires investigators to, among other things, facilitate the sharing of data that results from work supported by NSF grants. More on this policy can be found here . While the NSF's policy is not new, recent years have seen a renewed emphasis on data sharing and many other federal and private granting agencies also require some form of data management plan to accompany grant proposals.   Regardless, data management is good practice. You are likely doing some form of it already; the granting agencies are simply asking you to define your workflows and procedures for data management at the start of the project.     Some potential benefits to good data management (from MIT Libraries' Reasons to Manage &amp; Publish Your Data ):     Increase the visibility of your research: Making your data available to other researchers through widely-searched repositories can increase your prominence and demonstrate continued use of the data and relevance of your research.       Save time: Planning for your data management needs ahead of time will save you time and resources in the long run.       Simplify your life: Enabling a repository to house and disseminate your data lets you focus on your research rather than responding to requests or worrying about data that may be housed on your web site.       Preserve your data: Only by depositing your data in a repository can you be sure that they will be available to you and other researchers in the long-term. Doing so safeguards your investment of time and resources (including any work done for you by graduate students) and preserves your unique contribution to research.       Increase your research efficiency: Have you ever had a hard time understanding the data that you or your colleagues have collected? Documenting your data throughout its life cycle saves time because it ensures that in the future you and others will be able to understand and use your data.       Documentation: Managing and documenting your data throughout its life cycle ensures that the integrity and proper description of your data are maintained.       Meet grant requirements: Many funding agencies now require that researchers deposit in an archive data which they collect as part of a research project.       Facilitate new discoveries: Enabling other researchers to use your data reinforces open scientific inquiry and can lead to new and unanticipated discoveries. And doing so prevents duplication of effort by enabling others to use your data rather than trying to gather the data themselves.       Support Open Access: Researchers are becoming increasingly more aware of the need to manage their work and consider issues of scholarly communication. The Open Data movement advocates for researchers to share their data in order to foster the development of knowledge.                                                    close                                                                                                          What do you mean by \"data\"?                                                                                  What do you mean by \"data\"?                 NYU's Definition of \"Data\"     NYU lets the PI decide what needs to be described and retained, but offers a definition of Research Data.   Excerpts from the NYU Policy on Retention of and Access to Research Data : \"Definition: 'Research Data' means any recorded, retrievable information necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of reported results created in connection with the design, conduct or reporting of research performed or conducted at or under the auspices of the University and the events and processes leading to those results, regardless of the form or the media on which they may be recorded. Research data include both intangible data (statistics, finding, conclusions, etc.) and tangible data (notebooks, printouts, etc.), but not Tangible Research Property, which is subject to a separate NYU policy. \"The University must retain original Research Data in sufficient detail and for an adequate period of time to enable appropriate responses to questions about accuracy, authenticity, primacy and compliance with laws and regulations governing the conduct of the research and to establish priority for patentable items. \"It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to determine what needs to be retained under this policy.\"     Other Helpful Definitions of \"Data\"     United States Code of Federal Regulations: According to the Code of Federal Regulations , research data is, \"... defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues.\"   University of Oregon's Research Data Management page provides some examples of items that you might consider part of you \"research data\":     Documents (text, Word), spreadsheets   Laboratory notebooks, field notebooks, diaries   Questionnaires, transcripts, codebooks   Audiotapes, videotapes   Photographs, films   Protein or genetic sequences   Spectra   Test responses   Slides, artifacts, specimens, samples   Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during the process of research   Database contents (video, audio, text, images)   Models, algorithms, scripts   Contents of an application (input, output, logfiles for analysis software, simulation software, schemas)   Methodologies and workflows   Standard operating procedures and protocols     MIT Libraries' Data Management and Publishing Subject Guide provides the following examples of data types:    Observational: data captured in real-time, usually irreplaceable. Examples: Sensor data, telemetry, survey data, sample data, neuroimages.       Experimental: data from lab equipment, often reproducible, but can be expensive. Examples: gene sequences, chromatograms, toroid magnetic field data.       Simulation: data generated from test models where model and metadata (inputs) are more important than output data. Examples: climate models, economic models.       Derived or compiled: data that is reproducible (but very expensive). Examples: text and data mining, compiled database, 3D models, data gathered from public documents.                                                        close                                                                                                          NSF applicants                                                                                  About this page                 This page explains the specific DMP requirements for National Science Foundation (NSF) grant applicants.

NIH Data Management Plan Requirements                 Excerpted from the NIH Data Sharing Policy :   What to Include in an NIH Application   Investigators seeking $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year should include a description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data sharing is not possible. It is expected that the data sharing discussion will be provided primarily in the form of a brief paragraph immediately following the Research Plan Section of the PHS 398 application form (i.e., immediately after I. Letters of Support), and would not count towards the application page limit.   Data Sharing Plan (to follow immediately after the Research Plan Section)   The precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. Applicants who are planning to share data may wish to describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing, the format of the final dataset, the documentation to be provided, whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided, whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use), and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under their own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on their institutional or personal website, through a data archive or enclave). Investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement.   References to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application, as discussed below.   Budget and Budget Justification Sections   Applicants may request funds in their application for data sharing. If funds are being sought, the applicant should address the financial issues in the budget and budget justification sections. Some investigators have more experience than others in estimating costs associated with preparing the dataset and associated documentation, and providing support to data users. As investigators gain experience with the process, their ability to estimate costs will improve. Investigators working with archives can get help with data preparation and cost estimation. Investigators who are concerned about paying for data-sharing costs at the end of their grant can make prior arrangements with archives. Investigators facing considerable delays in the preparation of the final dataset for sharing should consult with the NIH program about how to manage this situation, such as requesting a no-cost extension.   Background and Significance Section (PHS 398 Research Plan Section B)   If support is being sought to develop a large database that will serve as an important resource for the scientific community, the applicant may wish to make a statement about this in the significance section of the application.   Human Subjects Section (PHS 398 Research Plan Section E)   If the research involves human subjects and the data are intended to be shared, the application should discuss how the rights and confidentiality of participants would be protected. In the Human Subjects section of the application, the applicant should discuss the potential risks to research participants posed by data sharing and steps taken to address those risks.   For the full policy on data sharing plans, please refer to NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance .            Comments (0)                                         Examples of NIH Data-Sharing Plans                 The precise content and level of detail to be included in a data-sharing plan depends on several factors, such as whether or not the investigator is planning to share data, the size and complexity of the dataset, and the like. Below are several examples of data-sharing plans.   Example 1   The proposed research will involve a small sample (less than 20 subjects) recruited from clinical facilities in the New York City area with Williams syndrome. This rare craniofacial disorder is associated with distinguishing facial features, as well as mental retardation. Even with the removal of all identifiers, we believe that it would be difficult if not impossible to protect the identities of subjects given the physical characteristics of subjects, the type of clinical data (including imaging) that we will be collecting, and the relatively restricted area from which we are recruiting subjects. Therefore, we are not planning to share the data.   Example 2   The proposed research will include data from approximately 500 subjects being screened for three bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) at an inner city STD clinic. The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects and laboratory data from urine specimens provided. Because the STDs being studied are reportable diseases, we will be collecting identifying information. Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.   Example 3   This application requests support to collect public-use data from a survey of more than 22,000 Americans over the age of 50 every 2 years. Data products from this study will be made available without cost to researchers and analysts. https://ssl.isr.umich.edu/hrs/  User registration is required in order to access or download files. As part of the registration process, users must agree to the conditions of use governing access to the public release data, including restrictions against attempting to identify study participants, destruction of the data after analyses are completed, reporting responsibilities, restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties, and proper acknowledgement of the data resource. Registered users will receive user support, as well as information related to errors in the data, future releases, workshops, and publication lists. The information provided to users will not be used for commercial purposes, and will not be redistributed to third parties.

NEH Data Management Plan Requirements                 Excerpted from Data Management Plans for NEH Office of Digital Humanities Proposals and Awards (PDF) :   The DMP should clearly articulate how sharing of primary data is to be implemented. It should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur should a project director or co-project director leave the institution or project. Any costs stemming from the management of data should be explained in the budget narrative. Specific components of the DMP are listed below.   Expected data   The DMP should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, or other materials to be produced in the course of the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.   Project directors should address matters such as these in the DMP:     the types of data that their project might generate and eventually share with others, and under what conditions   how data are to be managed and maintained until they are shared with others;   factors that might impinge on their ability to manage data, for example, legal and ethical restrictions on access to non-aggregated data;   the lowest level of aggregated data that project directors might share with others in the scholarly or scientific community, given that community&rsquo;s norms on data;   the mechanism for sharing data and/or making them accessible to others; and other types of information that should be maintained and shared regarding data, for example, the way it was generated, analytical and procedural information, and the metadata.     Period of data retention   NEH is committed to timely and rapid data distribution. However, it recognizes that types of data can vary widely and that acceptable norms also vary by discipline. It is strongly committed, however, to the underlying principle of timely access. In their DMP applicants should address how timely access will be assured.   Data formats and dissemination   The DMP should describe data formats, media, and dissemination approaches that will be used to make data and metadata available to others. Policies for public access and sharing should be described, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, and other rights or requirements. Research centers and major partnerships with industry or other user communities must also address how data are to be shared and managed with partners, center affiliates, and other major stakeholders.   Data storage and preservation of access   The DMP should describe physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data. These can include third-party facilities and repositories.

Metadata is structured information describing the characteristics of a resource; for example, the dates associated with a dataset or the title and author of a book. Metadata supports discovery, re-use and long-term preservation of resources. In order for your data to be used properly by you, your colleagues, and other researchers in the future, they must be documented. Planning what metadata will be captured and how this data will be structured should occur at the beginning of a research project, before data collection begins. Doing so will make automation of metadata creation easier and reduce the need for time-consuming metadata capture or restructuring later in the lifecycle of the research project. Researchers can choose among various metadata standards, often tailored to a particular file format or discipline. One such standard is DDI (the Data Documentation Initiative), designed to document numeric data files.           Comments (0)                                         Disciplinary Metadata Standards                 Metadata standards provide specific data fields or elements to be used in describing data for a particular use. Some research fields have predefined metadata standards, such as those listed below. Wikipedia also describes and links to other disciplinary metadata standards .

It's also recommended that back-ups be saved in open or standard file formats, and not be compressed or encrypted (though sensitive data may require encryption, see below).   Your personal computer, external hard drives, departmental or university servers, or commercial cloud storage resources such as Amazon S3 and Mozy are recommended locations/tools for backing up data. CDs or DVDs are not recommended because they fail so frequently.   Back-up copies of \"sensitive data\" may require special treatment.

The granting agencies will require that you comment on two kinds of data storage procedures:     How you will store your data during the time you are gathering and using it (we call this \"short-term\" storage) , and   How you will store your data after your project has ended (we call this \"long-term\" storage)     For both, you will need to present a clear plan. There is an NYU policy that lays out the University's expectations around storage , but sometimes the grant itself will stipulate certain aspects. Further, your professional organization may be helpful in deciding. To get started, click on the links above.

Data governance includes all the policies and practices that ensure UDW+ provides the university community with accurate and consistent information while protecting data security and confidentiality. Establishing systematic data management has been one of the principal objectives of the UDW+ program.   The key goals of establishing NYU's Data Governance Infrastructure include the following:       University Data Management Policy   Common definitions and metadata to facilitate efficient and accurate use by the reporting community. The components of UDW+ metadata include:   Common definitions to control inconsistent reporting     A data dictionary of all UDW+ data elements   For ad hoc reporting, mouse-over access to the definition of individual data elements     Relevant information about the data, definitions, available drills, use notes and target audience for all dashboard pages and reports         Governance structure and process for data validation, data and content certification, and metadata.     Data governance practices that ensure the ongoing integrity of UDW+ data and support the certification of published content. Data management practices include the following:     Data and content validation     Ongoing certification of data and standard reports     Business process validation     Error management     Metadata management     Security and access management                    Data Trustees , Data Stewards and Data Custodians have been or will be actively engaged in these subject areas and will continue to work with the Decision Support Group and UDW+ team in certifying and validating data.

Comments (0)                                         Data Management Plans and Data Sharing                 As of January 2011, The National Science Foundation (NSF) requires that new grant proposals include an appendix that describes plans for the management of research data. Such Data Management Plans (DMPs) will be evaluated as part of the grant proposal. The NSF maintains a policy on the dissemination and sharing of research data that requires investigators to, among other things, facilitate the sharing of data that results from work supported by NSF grants. More on this policy can be found here . While the NSF requirement is not new, recent years have seen a renewed emphasis on data sharing and many other federal agencies also require some form of data management plan to accompany grant proposals.   According to the Code of Federal Regulations , research data is, \"... defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues.\"   There are a number of things to consider when sharing data and developing a data management plan. Among them are the accommodation of legal and ethical requirements that protect confidentiality and personal information, the choices of metadata standards and description mechanisms that make data usable to other researchers and the enumeration of usage policies that governs the use of data. This guide serves as a resource for researchers who seek further understanding of data management and sharing or wish to avail themselves of NYU resources with respect to the same.   The NSF has provided a list of answers to frequently asked questions to further illuminate the requirements that undergird their data management appendix but these answers are applicable in many instances.

Comments (0)                                         Welcome                 Many key granting organizations, like NSF, NIH, NEH and more, now require submitters to include a Data Management Plan as part of their application. In short, these plans outline what steps the applicant will take to collect, safeguard, archive, and make available the data used for the research in question.     This guide lays out practical considerations and information to aid you in preparing your Data Management Plan, and leads you to a Data Management Plan Tool that you can use to create your plan.

Why are they asking me for a Data Management Plan?                 The National Science Foundation maintains a policy on the dissemination and sharing of research data that requires investigators to, among other things, facilitate the sharing of data that results from work supported by NSF grants. More on this policy can be found here . While the NSF's policy is not new, recent years have seen a renewed emphasis on data sharing and many other federal and private granting agencies also require some form of data management plan to accompany grant proposals.   Regardless, data management is good practice. You are likely doing some form of it already; the granting agencies are simply asking you to define your workflows and procedures for data management at the start of the project.     Some potential benefits to good data management (from MIT Libraries' Reasons to Manage &amp; Publish Your Data ):     Increase the visibility of your research: Making your data available to other researchers through widely-searched repositories can increase your prominence and demonstrate continued use of the data and relevance of your research.       Save time: Planning for your data management needs ahead of time will save you time and resources in the long run.       Simplify your life: Enabling a repository to house and disseminate your data lets you focus on your research rather than responding to requests or worrying about data that may be housed on your web site.       Preserve your data: Only by depositing your data in a repository can you be sure that they will be available to you and other researchers in the long-term. Doing so safeguards your investment of time and resources (including any work done for you by graduate students) and preserves your unique contribution to research.       Increase your research efficiency: Have you ever had a hard time understanding the data that you or your colleagues have collected? Documenting your data throughout its life cycle saves time because it ensures that in the future you and others will be able to understand and use your data.       Documentation: Managing and documenting your data throughout its life cycle ensures that the integrity and proper description of your data are maintained.       Meet grant requirements: Many funding agencies now require that researchers deposit in an archive data which they collect as part of a research project.       Facilitate new discoveries: Enabling other researchers to use your data reinforces open scientific inquiry and can lead to new and unanticipated discoveries. And doing so prevents duplication of effort by enabling others to use your data rather than trying to gather the data themselves.       Support Open Access: Researchers are becoming increasingly more aware of the need to manage their work and consider issues of scholarly communication. The Open Data movement advocates for researchers to share their data in order to foster the development of knowledge.                                                    close                                                                                                          What do you mean by \"data\"?                                                                                  What do you mean by \"data\"?                 NYU's Definition of \"Data\"     NYU lets the PI decide what needs to be described and retained, but offers a definition of Research Data.   Excerpts from the NYU Policy on Retention of and Access to Research Data : \"Definition: 'Research Data' means any recorded, retrievable information necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of reported results created in connection with the design, conduct or reporting of research performed or conducted at or under the auspices of the University and the events and processes leading to those results, regardless of the form or the media on which they may be recorded. Research data include both intangible data (statistics, finding, conclusions, etc.) and tangible data (notebooks, printouts, etc.), but not Tangible Research Property, which is subject to a separate NYU policy. \"The University must retain original Research Data in sufficient detail and for an adequate period of time to enable appropriate responses to questions about accuracy, authenticity, primacy and compliance with laws and regulations governing the conduct of the research and to establish priority for patentable items. \"It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to determine what needs to be retained under this policy.\"     Other Helpful Definitions of \"Data\"     United States Code of Federal Regulations: According to the Code of Federal Regulations , research data is, \"... defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: Preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues.\"   University of Oregon's Research Data Management page provides some examples of items that you might consider part of you \"research data\":     Documents (text, Word), spreadsheets   Laboratory notebooks, field notebooks, diaries   Questionnaires, transcripts, codebooks   Audiotapes, videotapes   Photographs, films   Protein or genetic sequences   Spectra   Test responses   Slides, artifacts, specimens, samples   Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during the process of research   Database contents (video, audio, text, images)   Models, algorithms, scripts   Contents of an application (input, output, logfiles for analysis software, simulation software, schemas)   Methodologies and workflows   Standard operating procedures and protocols     MIT Libraries' Data Management and Publishing Subject Guide provides the following examples of data types:    Observational: data captured in real-time, usually irreplaceable. Examples: Sensor data, telemetry, survey data, sample data, neuroimages.       Experimental: data from lab equipment, often reproducible, but can be expensive. Examples: gene sequences, chromatograms, toroid magnetic field data.       Simulation: data generated from test models where model and metadata (inputs) are more important than output data. Examples: climate models, economic models.       Derived or compiled: data that is reproducible (but very expensive). Examples: text and data mining, compiled database, 3D models, data gathered from public documents.                                                        close                                                                                                          NSF applicants                                                                                  About this page                 This page explains the specific DMP requirements for National Science Foundation (NSF) grant applicants.

NIH Data Management Plan Requirements                 Excerpted from the NIH Data Sharing Policy :   What to Include in an NIH Application   Investigators seeking $500,000 or more in direct costs in any year should include a description of how final research data will be shared, or explain why data sharing is not possible. It is expected that the data sharing discussion will be provided primarily in the form of a brief paragraph immediately following the Research Plan Section of the PHS 398 application form (i.e., immediately after I. Letters of Support), and would not count towards the application page limit.   Data Sharing Plan (to follow immediately after the Research Plan Section)   The precise content of the data-sharing plan will vary, depending on the data being collected and how the investigator is planning to share the data. Applicants who are planning to share data may wish to describe briefly the expected schedule for data sharing, the format of the final dataset, the documentation to be provided, whether or not any analytic tools also will be provided, whether or not a data-sharing agreement will be required and, if so, a brief description of such an agreement (including the criteria for deciding who can receive the data and whether or not any conditions will be placed on their use), and the mode of data sharing (e.g., under their own auspices by mailing a disk or posting data on their institutional or personal website, through a data archive or enclave). Investigators choosing to share under their own auspices may wish to enter into a data-sharing agreement.   References to data sharing may also be appropriate in other sections of the application, as discussed below.   Budget and Budget Justification Sections   Applicants may request funds in their application for data sharing. If funds are being sought, the applicant should address the financial issues in the budget and budget justification sections. Some investigators have more experience than others in estimating costs associated with preparing the dataset and associated documentation, and providing support to data users. As investigators gain experience with the process, their ability to estimate costs will improve. Investigators working with archives can get help with data preparation and cost estimation. Investigators who are concerned about paying for data-sharing costs at the end of their grant can make prior arrangements with archives. Investigators facing considerable delays in the preparation of the final dataset for sharing should consult with the NIH program about how to manage this situation, such as requesting a no-cost extension.   Background and Significance Section (PHS 398 Research Plan Section B)   If support is being sought to develop a large database that will serve as an important resource for the scientific community, the applicant may wish to make a statement about this in the significance section of the application.   Human Subjects Section (PHS 398 Research Plan Section E)   If the research involves human subjects and the data are intended to be shared, the application should discuss how the rights and confidentiality of participants would be protected. In the Human Subjects section of the application, the applicant should discuss the potential risks to research participants posed by data sharing and steps taken to address those risks.   For the full policy on data sharing plans, please refer to NIH Data Sharing Policy and Implementation Guidance .            Comments (0)                                         Examples of NIH Data-Sharing Plans                 The precise content and level of detail to be included in a data-sharing plan depends on several factors, such as whether or not the investigator is planning to share data, the size and complexity of the dataset, and the like. Below are several examples of data-sharing plans.   Example 1   The proposed research will involve a small sample (less than 20 subjects) recruited from clinical facilities in the New York City area with Williams syndrome. This rare craniofacial disorder is associated with distinguishing facial features, as well as mental retardation. Even with the removal of all identifiers, we believe that it would be difficult if not impossible to protect the identities of subjects given the physical characteristics of subjects, the type of clinical data (including imaging) that we will be collecting, and the relatively restricted area from which we are recruiting subjects. Therefore, we are not planning to share the data.   Example 2   The proposed research will include data from approximately 500 subjects being screened for three bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) at an inner city STD clinic. The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects and laboratory data from urine specimens provided. Because the STDs being studied are reportable diseases, we will be collecting identifying information. Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, we believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Thus, we will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.   Example 3   This application requests support to collect public-use data from a survey of more than 22,000 Americans over the age of 50 every 2 years. Data products from this study will be made available without cost to researchers and analysts. https://ssl.isr.umich.edu/hrs/  User registration is required in order to access or download files. As part of the registration process, users must agree to the conditions of use governing access to the public release data, including restrictions against attempting to identify study participants, destruction of the data after analyses are completed, reporting responsibilities, restrictions on redistribution of the data to third parties, and proper acknowledgement of the data resource. Registered users will receive user support, as well as information related to errors in the data, future releases, workshops, and publication lists. The information provided to users will not be used for commercial purposes, and will not be redistributed to third parties.

NEH Data Management Plan Requirements                 Excerpted from Data Management Plans for NEH Office of Digital Humanities Proposals and Awards (PDF) :   The DMP should clearly articulate how sharing of primary data is to be implemented. It should outline the rights and obligations of all parties with respect to their roles and responsibilities in the management and retention of research data. It should also consider changes to roles and responsibilities that will occur should a project director or co-project director leave the institution or project. Any costs stemming from the management of data should be explained in the budget narrative. Specific components of the DMP are listed below.   Expected data   The DMP should describe the types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum materials, or other materials to be produced in the course of the project. It should then describe the expected types of data to be retained.   Project directors should address matters such as these in the DMP:     the types of data that their project might generate and eventually share with others, and under what conditions   how data are to be managed and maintained until they are shared with others;   factors that might impinge on their ability to manage data, for example, legal and ethical restrictions on access to non-aggregated data;   the lowest level of aggregated data that project directors might share with others in the scholarly or scientific community, given that community&rsquo;s norms on data;   the mechanism for sharing data and/or making them accessible to others; and other types of information that should be maintained and shared regarding data, for example, the way it was generated, analytical and procedural information, and the metadata.     Period of data retention   NEH is committed to timely and rapid data distribution. However, it recognizes that types of data can vary widely and that acceptable norms also vary by discipline. It is strongly committed, however, to the underlying principle of timely access. In their DMP applicants should address how timely access will be assured.   Data formats and dissemination   The DMP should describe data formats, media, and dissemination approaches that will be used to make data and metadata available to others. Policies for public access and sharing should be described, including provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual property, and other rights or requirements. Research centers and major partnerships with industry or other user communities must also address how data are to be shared and managed with partners, center affiliates, and other major stakeholders.   Data storage and preservation of access   The DMP should describe physical and cyber resources and facilities that will be used for the effective preservation and storage of research data. These can include third-party facilities and repositories.

Metadata is structured information describing the characteristics of a resource; for example, the dates associated with a dataset or the title and author of a book. Metadata supports discovery, re-use and long-term preservation of resources. In order for your data to be used properly by you, your colleagues, and other researchers in the future, they must be documented. Planning what metadata will be captured and how this data will be structured should occur at the beginning of a research project, before data collection begins. Doing so will make automation of metadata creation easier and reduce the need for time-consuming metadata capture or restructuring later in the lifecycle of the research project. Researchers can choose among various metadata standards, often tailored to a particular file format or discipline. One such standard is DDI (the Data Documentation Initiative), designed to document numeric data files.

Some research fields have predefined metadata standards, such as those listed below. Wikipedia also describes and links to other disciplinary metadata standards .

It's also recommended that back-ups be saved in open or standard file formats, and not be compressed or encrypted (though sensitive data may require encryption, see below).   Your personal computer, external hard drives, departmental or university servers, or commercial cloud storage resources such as Amazon S3 and Mozy are recommended locations/tools for backing up data. CDs or DVDs are not recommended because they fail so frequently.   Back-up copies of \"sensitive data\" may require special treatment. For further guidance, please consult NYU's policy on transmitting and storing sensitive data .

CUSP observes, analyzes, and models cities to optimize outcomes, prototype new solutions, formalize new tools and processes, and develop new expertise/experts. These activities will make CUSP the world&#8217;s leading authority in the emerging field of &#8220;Urban Informatics.&#8221;     A crucial activity at CUSP is data management, from acquisition, cleaning, and integration to data analysis.\u00a0 CUSP seeks to hire a Research Scientist in data management to help design and build the urban data warehouse. This includes the selection of a set of tools for storing and accessing the data, the development of a suite of workflows to manage and share these data as well as the infrastructure to maintain a detailed audit record of the data processing pipeline.\u00a0 The data warehouse and associated infrastructure will produce results that are specific to numerous research interests at CUSP, but sufficiently generalizable to inform a critical understanding of data science needs across different domains.     Primary Duties     Working with the Data Team to design and implement CUSP&#8217;s data warehouse. Activities include:Data cataloging and meta-data management: building and managing a platform for storing metadata of all datasets at CUSP. This includes administering an open-source data sharing platform and customizing it specifically for our needs. This taks requires basic understanding of programming and database management. The goal is to allow users to quickly browse and search available datasets. As such the incumbent will work closely with the data curator to accomplish this work.         Day-to-day maintenance of the data warehouse, including performance tuning for the workflows, queries and analyses, and the generation of specific data products. This task includes extracting metadata from raw data source: given some sample data/data-streams, incumbent will need to extract its metadata, including data schema, and ingesting it into our catalog.\u00a0 Since data sometime comes in as a form low-level digital format (e.g. database archives, shape files), incumbent will be expected to write code/script to read the data and interact with data curator, who will catalog ingested data sets as well as derived data products.         Creation of a suite of workflows to ingest, clean, extract, translate and load data sets acquired by CUSP. These workflows will be instrumented to allow the capture of detailed audit information about how the data was manipulated and by whom.\u00a0 This task entails bulk data ingestion that would use the data schema extracted as outlined above to filter information on the complete data stream. Most of the time, this step will requires access to the entire data stream, and should be done on the back-end where access to the database at a lower level (for efficiency) is required. This task also requires knowledge of large-scale data analysis.         Developing/Deploying a platform for managing data access process at CUSP. This task involves working with the IT team to provide data access supports. The goal here is to ultimately convert our data access pipeline to some form of an online process, where users with different roles (data stewards vs data users) just login and sign things off electronically. This automation would benefit the auditing capabilities of our system while improving its usability and integration with project management.         Data marts preparation: this task includes handling requests for making data available to users as well as preparing space for in taking data. Depending on the request, the incumbent will collaborate with different member of the IT team and the data team. This task may involve some database administration (DBA) duty.       Required Qualifications     M.S. in computer science.   Demonstrated programming skills and building commercial-quality software systems.   Knowledge of database systems and data management techniques.   Demonstrated experiences with front-end (web-based) applications and how to customize them.   Demonstrated ability to establish positive and productive collaborations with diverse groups.   Effective oral and written communication skills.       Desired Qualifications     More than two years&#8217; experience in programming.   Knowledge and understanding of best practices in software engineering.   Experience participating or managing projects with complex workloads.   Experience with large-scale storage systems, databases &#8212; SQL and NoSQL and digital libraries.
