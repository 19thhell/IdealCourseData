Along with the studio classes, students will have the opportunity to meet and have their work critiqued by contemporary artists. This program is free of charge . The Visionary Studio ( scheduled on 4 of the Saturdays, TBD ) part of the program brings in working artists to lecture about their work and critique projects done in the classroom. Students will have an opportunity to ask questions and acquire more in depth knowledge of what it means to be an artist in the modern age.    On the final day of the program, we will bring in several artists and Steinhardt alumni for a final critique of the work done during the entire program. The following day, we will have a one-day final exhibition of the work in the art building, opened to all family and friends. During the exhibition, all work will be documented for the students and given to them for their final portfolio.    With these workshops we aim to not only help teenagers find their voices through art, but also in everyday life. As part of the class, each student presents his/her own work, thus affording the opportunity to hone communication and presentation skills. We feel that this part of the program helps to develop skills, which can be useful in preparation for college, and ultimately outside the classroom. High school students must apply with a portfolio of work to be admitted to the Advanced Workshop.    Spring 2015 Advanced Art Workshop    The next workshops will be offered on nine Saturdays this spring from 9:30am-12:30pm:    2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, 3/28, 4/18, 4/25, 5/2, 5/9 Plus Sunday 5/10, Final Exhibition &amp; Reception *Visionary Studio lecture series will meet from 1:00-3:00pm on dates TBD. If accepted to participate, attendance in all of these dates is mandatory.    Advanced Art Workshop Descriptions    Sculpture In this class, students will learn two different ways of making sculpture. The first half of this course will engage students in the basic processes of moldmaking with plaster and clay. You will cast objects of their choosing using press molding and slip casting, and have the option of firing their work. The second half of this course will focus on soft sculpture as a medium, using various types of textiles. Technical skills such as machine and hand sewing, grommetting, and basic pattern making will be covered. Students will use these skills to respond to basic sculptural prompts. Additionally, students will participate in class critiques of their projects. Brief lectures will be given on contemporary sculpture.    Experimental Painting This class, as opposed to the traditional introductory classes in painting which usually focus on basic technique, will take a more modern approach to painting and focus on what we as contemporary viewers value from painting today. The goal is not to dismiss technique (for it is obviously very important) but to expose younger students who might not otherwise have the chance, to what it means to be a painter today. Experimentation will be key, not for its own sake, but for the rewards that will arise from trial and error.    Photo/Digital Art This course will include an introduction to several techniques in creating digital artwork. Students will learn basic skills in image and video editing software, which will provide the basis for completing several class projects, as well as discuss how digital techniques can be useful in creating traditional works. The class will begin by looking at digital photography/collage and progress into video and the moving image. Further, we will be looking at a number of contemporary and modern artists working in the field as a means of contextualizing work completed in the class.

GE are graduate level.    LIBAR-UE 0941 Art: Practice and Ideas Steinhardt students can satisfy &ldquo;Expressive Cultures&rdquo; requirement. Art: Practice and Ideas examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create &amp; reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting &amp; sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, &amp; computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, &amp; postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, &amp; technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical &amp; social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time. ARTCR-UE 0050 Modern Art and Contemporary Culture Examines the impact of modernism in both its historic &amp; contemporary relationships to culture &amp; society, through the study of painting, sculpture, architecture, &amp; the media arts from the late 1800&rsquo;s to the late 1950s. Art history with a theoretical &amp; aesthetic emphasis. Relates the art of the period to political, social, &amp; philosophical issues &amp; to current debates. Works of art are considered from slides, films, and reproductions. ART-UE 1914 Interdisciplinary Projects: Representation and Identity Open only to art majors or by permission. Prerequisite: three semesters of painting. Consideration of particular techniques allows students to broaden the range of their skills and expression. This is a studio class. Each week begins with a 20-minute discussion of current gallery or museum exhibitions that we have seen. Critiques will be every 3rd week. Students will be expected to work on their own ideas or projects. I will work with each student based on where they are in that process. Technical advice will be individual as well. Students are encourage to fully investigate their materials during this class. If there is a need for specific assignments this will be done on an individual basis. Students are encouraged to keep drawing journals and start a file of resource material with their paintings in mind. ART-UE 1391 Advanced Projects in Digital Art: \"Mind Remapping\" In this course, students will develop projects that use, critique and expand the notion and boundaries of digital media. The exploration of the mind's own processing of information will be a conceptual foundation for the course as we examine the ways in which digital tools mimic, respond to and amplify human desire. Media in the class will range from images and animation to video and music. The class will be an opportunity to both learn new tools and deepen skills already begun. Projects will be presented and discussed. ART-UE 1393 Advanced Projects in Art &amp; Media: &ldquo;Performance and Photo/Video&rdquo; This class will utilize each student&rsquo;s body in situ or in photography or video to demonstrate issues that transcend the particular aura of the individual and spread ideas into and from culture.
