Through one course, on 20th-century politics and society, he traveled with his class to locations in Germany and Poland, where they toured the memorial site at Auschwitz, the former death camp. In another course, on contemporary Berlin, Alex\u2019s professor made use of what he called a \u201cflying classroom,\u201d meeting his class each week at a different historical location in the city. Through this same course, Alex met a woman whose father had been a Nazi official. She allowed the class to screen the documentary she had produced about national guilt, generational clashes, and cultural identity. Afterward, the students had a chance to speak with her directly about her experiences. Alex says, \u201cI can read or listen to a lecture anywhere in the world. Learning about Germany firsthand was true \u2018fieldwork\u2019 and was invaluable to my education.\u201d   Alex sees himself as a fiercely independent person. However, he says, \u201cMy entire life, I had lived within 15 miles of New York City. I chose NYU not only because it\u2019s an excellent school but also because of the professional opportunities New York City offers. That being said, I have always dwelled in a certain \u2018comfort zone.\u2019 Going abroad was a true test\u2014to leave my comfort zone and adapt to an unfamiliar world.\u201d                                                NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
