NYU Abu Dhabi              NYU Shanghai   NYU Shanghai students spend at least five semesters in Shanghai and at least one semester elsewhere in NYU's global network. Students study with superb teachers who nurture their capacity for original, rigorous, and critical thinking, and with diverse and intellectually gifted classmates. They pursue a liberal education in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and mathematics. They master the skills of cross-cultural effectiveness in a community where half are from China and half are from other lands. They reflect upon the role that great cities play in human progress, and upon the interdependent relationship between China and the rest of the world.       NYU Shanghai                         Highlighted Centers  and Institutes   NYU offers hundreds of unique opportunities to study with specialized centers or institutes. Some of those centers or institutes will also offer degrees for academic studies and are highlighted here.
