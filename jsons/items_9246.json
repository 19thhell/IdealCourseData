Seminar:  Cold War in Asia    EAST-UA  552 Offered  every year. 4 points.    Focuses  on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and  concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) are  the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We examine the following  topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the  U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the  isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's  global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan;  Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian  issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H.

History  of Modern Korea    EAST-UA  609 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Starting  in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910\u201345),  national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950\u201352), and the establishment of a  \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized  around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues  that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on  modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a  broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent  texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were  reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.          Korean  Modernism    EAST-UA  610 4  points.    Considers  the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other  cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter  modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among  imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular. Through intensive reading  of works from 1920s and 1930s Korea, students obtain an idea of the parameters  of modern Korean literature and of the main issues involved in the discussion  of modernity in Korea.          20th-Century  Korean Literature in Translation    EAST-UA  611 4  points.

Examines  key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such  as the connections between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect  of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and  specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form.          Aesthetics  and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan    EAST-UA  615 Looser.  4 points.    Offers  a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the  mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of  seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these  visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental  transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a  range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts,  architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary  perspectives.          Approaches  to Chinese Cinema    EAST-UA  618 4 points.    The  development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the  emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film  became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course  emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as  formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are  explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and  sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.          Mass  Culture: Japan    EAST-UA  707 Looser.  4 points.    Looks  at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan,  largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes  considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday  life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples  from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the  fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the  rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.          Japanese  Animation and New Media    EAST-UA  708 Looser.  4 points.    Looks  at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not  exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression.  Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of  expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in  animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre;  and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception.  Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also  considered. Epic Romances of Asia: China, Japan, and Vietnam EAST-UA 718 Roberts. 4 points. Covers comparatively three romantic classics of Asian literature, one Vietnamese ( Tale of Kieu ), one Japanese ( Tale of Genji ), and one Chinese ( Dream of the Red Chamber ), plus brief supplementary Buddhist texts. All literary texts are read in their entirety, except for limited optional exclusions from Dream of the Red Chamber , due to its great length (over 2000 pages). Major topics are the character of the heroines, whose role is central in each work, the relationship of romance and marriage to political power and social customs, the authority of parents and elders. Confucian secular concepts of authority co-exist and contend with concepts of Buddhist reinterpretation of the secular world and the escapes from its suffering that Buddhism offers both institutionally and ideologically. While focusing on analysis of the readings, students are urged to explore secondary scholarly studies. Topics  in Japanese Literature    EAST-UA  719 4  points.    Topics  vary semester by semester.          Readings  in Chinese Philosophy and Culture    EAST-UA  722 Formerly  Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.    Covers  Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the  era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206  B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states.  During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were  established. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of  Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of  his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and  followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the  legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of  Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the  transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. We  end with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the  novel The  Three Kingdoms .  The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin  and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four  centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280  C.E.          Historical  Epics of China and Japan    EAST-UA  726 Roberts.  4 points.    We  compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the  Heike ;  and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red  Mansions .  These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written  by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military  epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the  qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to  the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and  military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the  royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female  characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with  two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on  Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged).  Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex  narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these  three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and  the larger design of the authors.

We examine the following  topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the  U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the  isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's  global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan;  Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian  issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H.

Reading primary and secondary sources on  modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a  broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent  texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were  reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.          Korean  Modernism    EAST-UA  610 4  points.    Considers  the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other  cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter  modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among  imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular. Through intensive reading  of works from 1920s and 1930s Korea, students obtain an idea of the parameters  of modern Korean literature and of the main issues involved in the discussion  of modernity in Korea.          20th-Century  Korean Literature in Translation    EAST-UA  611 4  points.    Provides  an overview of 20th-century Korean literature, tracing its development under  the competing influences of tradition, history, and the West. Readings include  drama, poetry, and fiction from modern and contemporary periods. Includes  occasional lectures on classical forms of Korean literature and drama.          Japanese  Cinema    EAST-UA  613 Offered  every year. 4 points.    Examines  key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such  as the connections between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect  of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and  specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form.          Aesthetics  and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan    EAST-UA  615 Looser.  4 points.    Offers  a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the  mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of  seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these  visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental  transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a  range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts,  architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary  perspectives.          Approaches  to Chinese Cinema    EAST-UA  618 4 points.    The  development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the  emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film  became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course  emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as  formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are  explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and  sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.          Mass  Culture: Japan    EAST-UA  707 Looser.  4 points.    Looks  at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan,  largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes  considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday  life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples  from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the  fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the  rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.          Japanese  Animation and New Media    EAST-UA  708 Looser.  4 points.    Looks  at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not  exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression.  Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of  expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in  animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre;  and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception.  Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also  considered. Epic Romances of Asia: China, Japan, and Vietnam EAST-UA 718 Roberts. 4 points. Covers comparatively three romantic classics of Asian literature, one Vietnamese ( Tale of Kieu ), one Japanese ( Tale of Genji ), and one Chinese ( Dream of the Red Chamber ), plus brief supplementary Buddhist texts. All literary texts are read in their entirety, except for limited optional exclusions from Dream of the Red Chamber , due to its great length (over 2000 pages). Major topics are the character of the heroines, whose role is central in each work, the relationship of romance and marriage to political power and social customs, the authority of parents and elders. Confucian secular concepts of authority co-exist and contend with concepts of Buddhist reinterpretation of the secular world and the escapes from its suffering that Buddhism offers both institutionally and ideologically. While focusing on analysis of the readings, students are urged to explore secondary scholarly studies. Topics  in Japanese Literature    EAST-UA  719 4  points.    Topics  vary semester by semester.          Readings  in Chinese Philosophy and Culture    EAST-UA  722 Formerly  Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.    Covers  Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the  era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206  B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states.  During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were  established. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of  Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of  his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and  followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the  legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of  Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the  transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. We  end with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the  novel The  Three Kingdoms .  The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin  and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four  centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280  C.E.          Historical  Epics of China and Japan    EAST-UA  726 Roberts.  4 points.    We  compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the  Heike ;  and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red  Mansions .  These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written  by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military  epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the  qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to  the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and  military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the  royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female  characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with  two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on  Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged).  Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex  narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these  three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and  the larger design of the authors.          Topics  in East Asian Classics    EAST-UA  728 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    Topics  vary semester by semester.          Traditional  Drama of China &amp; Japan    EAST-UA  729 Roberts.  4 points.    Compares  a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also  as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident,  character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention  is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions  and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also  considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened  for the class or assigned for viewing.          20th-Century  Chinese Literature in Translation    EAST-UA  731   Offered every year. 4 points.    Explores  the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and  historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on  the culture and self-understanding of modern China.          Japan  Through Its Literature    EAST-UA  734 No  knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.    Introduces  undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works,  starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji , which became a  national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness , texts of Noh  plays, the Chushingura , and plays of  Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels  starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first  modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment , Sound of the  Mountain ,  and The  Waiting Years .  Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a  longer paper.          Vietnam:  Its History    EAST-UA  737 Identical  to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points.    Focuses  on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it  was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military  strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are  regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an  oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.  Begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of  French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the  war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS  links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's  deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower  administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the  decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy  administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war  under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and  interpretations of them.          Introduction  to Buddhism    EAST-UA  832 Identical  to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.

Instructors ground students in the various forms of cultural contact, diffusion, and resistance by which fundamental ideas about the nature and structure of society have circulated across cultures and compare the way concepts like \u201cjustice\u201d have been treated in widely disparate traditions. Students are encouraged to distinguish between understanding a text in its historical setting and engaging in broad historical criticism. Accordingly, writing assignments strive to strike a balance between close reading and comparative assessment. Social Foundations I SF I introduces students to the ancient world and ends with the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, the Gupta Empire in India, and the Han Dynasty in China. This course takes a global perspective and uses an interdisciplinary approach, and part of its aim is to explore enduring questions such as the relation between the individual and society, between justice and power, and between humanity and the divine. The ancient societies from which the texts emerged are as much objects of study as the ancient texts themselves. Students are expected to consider many ideas with which they might not agree. They ask how these earlier conceptions speak to their own lives and how these earlier ideas connect to the world today. Students are encouraged to distinguish between understanding a text in its historical settings and engaging in broad historical criticism. Accordingly, writing assignments strive to strike a balance between close reading and comparative assessment. In addition to drawing seminal texts from the Mediterranean world and the Middle East, instructors give extended attention to at least one Mediterranean/non-European culture. Social Foundations II SF II spans a thousand years, from the rise of Islam and the reunification of China under the Tang Dynasty (in the 7th century CE) through the Scientific Revolution and the decline of the Mogul Empire in India. This course invites students to consider great ideas that have often helped earlier peoples organize their lives \u2014 but which have also set them in conflict sometimes with other communities and sometimes among themselves. Such ideas have sparked movements for ethical and social reform, conquest, recovery of lost classics, and religious renewal. Vast new empires appear during this period, but so do challenges to their rule. Religious conflicts lead to civil war, and modern science emerges as a challenge to traditional beliefs. Throughout, different conceptions of human nature emerge and collide. Oppression gives rise to new movements for greater equality and individual rights, and bitter struggles for power lead to the creation of large new colonial empires, whose effects linger to the present day. In addition, the world\u2019s different civilizations come into increasing contact through exploration and trade. Students are expected to consider these ideas and developments critically, with an eye to their philosophical, political, and historical significance; and they are encouraged to explore the ways in which texts that have often been read in exclusively Western contexts yield new meaning when placed in non-Western settings. Social Foundations III SF III examines major intellectual and historical events from the Enlightenment and the Qing Dynasty (around 1700) to the contemporary world. This period has seen some of the most rapid and significant changes in human society and scientific understanding. At the same time, many of the enduring questions of humanity have become even more critical as disparate cultures interact in a new global arena. This course is a capstone to the foundations sequence; accordingly, authors and themes come from a range of texts both interdisciplinary and international. Among the themes the course explores are the philosophical and political debates that followed the creation of global colonial empires, as societies from around the world confronted imperial polices and institutions. The course also considers the rise of vast, new international markets; the spread of revolutionary and national liberation movements in the 19th and 20th centuries; new challenges to established property; and the social effects of industrialization. In addition, instructors discuss postmodern attempts to question and undermine the institutions and practices that structure contemporary societies. In this part of the sequence, students consider criticisms of Western practices that form both within the West and from other regions of the world, giving special attention to the reception of Western texts by other traditions and, conversely, the influence of these other traditions on the West.
