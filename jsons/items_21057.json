Policy analysts are concerned with the development and evaluation of strategies to improve the functioning of the health care delivery system. In some instances this role is played in a governmental agency responsible for regulating and financing health services. In other instances a policy analyst works for an organization that provides health care services, a nonprofit service organization, or a professional association or foundation. Responsibilities often include the development and analysis of data to support policy initiatives, an assessment of new health care initiatives using techniques such as cost-benefit analysis, program evaluation, implementation analysis, and the development of formal health plans to anticipate future needs for health care resources.

Policy analysts are concerned with the development and evaluation of strategies to improve the functioning of the health care delivery system. In some instances this role is played in a governmental agency responsible for regulating and financing health services. In other instances a policy analyst works for an organization that provides health care services, a nonprofit service organization, or a professional association or foundation. Responsibilities often include the development and analysis of data to support policy initiatives, an assessment of new health care initiatives using techniques such as cost-benefit analysis, program evaluation, implementation analysis, and the development of formal health plans to anticipate future needs for health care resources.
