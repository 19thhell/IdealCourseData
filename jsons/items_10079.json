We live in the era of Big Data, with storage and transmission capacity measured not just in terabytes but in petabytes (where peta -   denotes a quadrillion, or a thousand trillion). Data collection is   constant and even insidious, with every click and every \u201clike\u201d stored   somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but   \u201craw,\u201d that we shouldn\u2019t think of data as a natural resource but as a   cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The   book\u2019s essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the   predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways   that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are   mutually defining; how data are variously \u201ccooked\u201d in the processes of   their collection and use; and conflicts over what can\u2014or can\u2019t\u2014be   \u201creduced\u201d to data. Contributors discuss the intellectual history of data   as a concept; describe early financial modeling and some unusual   sources for astronomical data; discover the prehistory of the database   in newspaper clippings and index cards; and consider contemporary   \u201cdataveillance\u201d of our online habits as well as the complexity of   scientific data curation.

Williams Publisher's Page                        A Companion to the History of the English Language   By Haruko Momma (Co-edited with Michael Matto)   A Companion to the History of the English Language addresses the linguistic, cultural, social, and literary approaches to language study. The first text to offer a complete survey of the field, this volume provides the most up-to-date insights of leading international scholars. \u2022 An accessible reference to the history of the English language \u2022 Comprises more than sixty essays written by leading international scholars \u2022 Aids literature students in incorporating language study into their work \u2022 Includes an historical survey of the English language, from its Germanic and Indo- European beginnings to modern British and American English \u2022 Enriched with maps, diagrams, and illustrations from historical publications \u2022 Introduces the latest scholarship in the field    Publisher\u2019s page           Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture   By Lisa Gitelman   In Always Already New, Lisa Gitelman explores the newness of new media while she asks what it means to do media history. Using the examples of early recorded sound and digital networks, Gitelman challenges readers to think about the ways that media work as the simultaneous subjects and instruments of historical inquiry. Presenting original case studies of Edison's first phonographs and the Pentagon's first distributed digital network, the ARPANET, Gitelman points suggestively toward similarities that underlie the cultural definition of records (phonographic and not) at the end of the nineteenth century and the definition of documents (digital and not) at the end of the twentieth. As a result, Always Already New speaks to present concerns about the humanities as much as to the emergent field of new media studies. Records and documents are kernels of humanistic thought, after all\u2014part of and party to the cultural impulse to preserve and interpret. Gitelman's argument suggests inventive contexts for \"humanities computing\" while also offering a new perspective on such traditional humanities disciplines as literary history.    Making extensive use of archival sources, Gitelman describes the ways in which recorded sound and digitally networked text each emerged as local anomalies that were yet deeply embedded within the reigning logic of public life and public memory. In the end Gitelman turns to the World Wide Web and asks how the history of the Web is already being told, how the Web might also resist history, and how using the Web might be producing the conditions of its own historicity. Publisher\u2019s page           Ambiguities of Witnessing: Law and Literature in the Time of a Truth Commission   By Mark Sanders   The first book to explore the complex relationship between law and literature in testimony to crimes of apartheid before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Ambiguities of Witnessing closely analyzes key individual testimonies. Whereas most existing books on this and other truth commissions are weighed down by abstract legal and philosophical discussion, this book does justice to witnesses\u2019 public testimony in a fascinating and theoretically sophisticated investigation of questions of human rights, mourning, forgiveness, and reparation. Framed by the personal, Ambiguities of Witnessing also meditates on what it means for the writer to respond to this epochal event in the history of post-apartheid South Africa.    Publisher\u2019s page           An Ethics of Betrayal: The Politics of Otherness in Emergent U.S. Literatures and Culture   By Crystal Parikh   In An Ethics of Betrayal, Crystal Parikh investigates the theme and tropes of betrayal and treason in Asian American and Chicano/Latino literary and cultural narratives. In considering betrayal from an ethical perspective, one grounded in the theories of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, Parikh argues that the minority subject is obligated in a primary, preontological, and irrecusable relation of responsibility to the Other. Episodes of betrayal and treason allegorize the position of this subject, beholden to the many others who embody the alterity of existence and whose demands upon the subject result in transgressions of intimacy and loyalty. In this first major comparative study of narratives by and about Asian Americans and Latinos, Parikh considers writings by Frank Chin, Gish Jen, Chang-rae Lee, Eric Liu, Am\u00e9rico Parades, and Richard Rodriguez, as well as narratives about the persecution of Wen Ho Lee and the rescue and return of Elian Gonz\u00e1lez. By addressing the conflicts at the heart of filiality, the public dimensions of language in the constitution of minority \"community,\" and the mercenary mobilizations of \"model minority\" status, An Ethics of Betrayal seriously engages the challenges of conducting ethnic and critical race studies based on the uncompromising and unromantic ideas of justice, reciprocity, and ethical society. Publisher\u2019s page            Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage   By Erin B. Mee (co-edited with Helene P. Foley)   Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage is the first book to analyse what happens to Sophocles' play as it is adapted and (re)produced around the world, and the first to focus specifically on Antigone in performance. The essays, by an international gathering of noted scholars from a wide range of disciplines, highlight the numerous ways in which social, political, historical, and cultural contexts transform the material, how artists and audiences in diverse societies including Argentina, The Congo, Finland, Haiti, India, Japan, and the United States interact with it, and the variety of issues it has been used to address.      Publisher's page                  Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry   By Maureen N. McLane   This is a new history and theory of British poetry between 1760 and 1830, focusing on the relationship between Romantic poetry and the production, circulation, and textuality of ballads. By discussing the ways in which eighteenth-century cultural and literary researches flowed into and shaped key canonical works, Maureen McLane argues that Romantic poetry\u2019s influences went far beyond the merely literary. Breathing new life into the work of eighteenth-century balladeers and antiquarians, she addresses the revival of the ballad, the figure of the minstrel, and the prevalence of a \u201cminstrelsy complex\u201d in Romanticism. Furthermore, she envisages a new way of engaging with Romantic poetics, encompassing both \u201coral\u201d and \u201cliterary\u201d modes of poetic construction, and anticipates the role that technology might play in a media-driven twenty-first century. The study will be of great interest to scholars and students of Romantic poetry, literature, and culture.  Publisher\u2019s page           Citizen Shakespeare: Freemen and Aliens in the Language of the Plays   By John Michael Archer   Shakespeare lived his professional life amid the London streets and died a prominent figure in the town of Stratford. The language of his plays is shot through with the concerns of London \"freemen\" and their wives, the diverse commercial class that nevertheless excluded adult immigrants from country towns and northern Europe alike. This book combines London historiography, close reading, and recent theories of citizen subjectivity to demonstrate for the first time that Shakespeare's plays embody citizen and alien identities despite their aristocratic settings. The book points out where the city shadows the country scenes of the major comedies, shows how London's trades animate the \"civil butchery\" of the history plays, and explains why England's metropolis becomes the fractured Rome of tragedy.    Publisher\u2019s page           Course in General Linguistics   By Perry Meisel (translated by Wade Baskin and co-edited with Haun Saussy)   The founder of modern linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure inaugurated semiology, structuralism, and deconstruction and made possible the work of Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, thus enabling the development of French feminism, gender studies, New Historicism, and postcolonialism. Based on Saussure\u2019s lectures, Course in General Linguistics (1916) traces the rise and fall of the historical linguistics in which Saussure was trained, the synchronic or structural linguistics with which he replaced it, and the new look of diachronic linguistics that followed this change. Most important, Saussure presents the principles of a new linguistic science that includes the invention of semiology, or the theory of the \u201csignifier,\u201d the \u201csignified,\u201d and the \u201csign\u201d that they combine to produce.     This is the first critical edition of Course in General Linguistics to appear in English and restores Wade Baskin\u2019s original translation of 1959, in which the terms \u201csignifier\u201d and \u201csignified\u201d are introduced into English in this precise way. Baskin renders Saussure clearly and accessibly, allowing readers to experience his shift of the theory of reference from mimesis to performance and his expansion of poetics to include all media, including the life sciences and environmentalism. An introduction situates Saussure within the history of ideas and describes the history of scholarship that made Course in General Linguistics legendary. New endnotes enlarge Saussure\u2019s contexts to include literary criticism, cultural studies, and philosophy.        Publisher\u2019s page           Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation   By John Guillory   John Guillory challenges the most fundamental premises of the canon   debate by resituating the problem of canon formation in an entirely new   theoretical framework. The result is a book that promises to recast not   only the debate about the literary curriculum but also the controversy   over \"multiculturalism\" and the current \"crisis of the humanities.\"   Employing concepts drawn from Pierre Bourdieu's sociology, Guillory   argues that canon formation must be understood less as a question of the   representation of social groups than as a question of the distribution   of \"cultural capital\" in the schools, which regulate access to literacy,   to the practices of reading and writing. Publisher's Page           Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire, and Modern British Literature   By Patrick Deer   Culture in Camouflage aims to remap the history of British war culture by insisting on the centrality and importance of the literature of the Second World War. The book offers the first comprehensive account of the emergence of modern war culture, arguing that its exceptional forms and temporalities force us to reappraise British cultural modernity. The book explores how writers like Ford Madox Ford, Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, T.E. Lawrence, Winston Churchill,Elizabeth Bowen, Virginia Woolf, James Hanley, Rex Warner, Alexander Baron, Keith Douglas, Henry Green, and Graham Greene contested the dominant narratives of war projected by an enormously powerful and persuasive mass media and culture industry. Patrick Deer reads war literature as one element in an expanded cultural field, which also includes popular culture and mass communications, the productions of war planners and military historians, projections of new technologies of violence, the fantasies and theories of strategists, and the material culture of total war. Modern war cultures, Deer contends, are defined by their drive to normalize conflict and war-making, by their struggle to colonize the entire wartime cultural field, and by their claim to monopolize representations and interpretation of the conflict. But the mobilization of cultural formations during wartime reveals, at times glaringly, the constitutive contradictions at the heart of modern ideas of culture. The Great War failed to produce a popular war culture on the home front, producing instead an extraordinary literature of protest, yet the strategists struggled to regain their oversight over both the enemy across no man's land, and the minds and bodies of their own mass conscript armies. The interwar years saw a massive effort to make strategic fantasies a reality; if the technology of imperial air power or mobile armoured warfare did not yet exist, culture could be mobilized to shore up the ramshackle war machine. During World War Two a fully fledged British war culture emerged triumphant in time of national crisis, offering the vision of a fully mobilized island fortress, a loyal empire, and a modernized war machine ready to wage a futuristic war of space and movement. This was the struggle that British World War Two writers confronted with extraordinary courage and creativity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Digital Literary Studies: Corpus Approaches to Poetry, Prose, and Drama   By David L. Hoover, Jonathan Culpeper, and Kieran O'Halloran   Digital Literary Studies presents a broad and varied picture of the promise and potential of methods and approaches that are crucially dependent upon the digital nature of the literary texts it studies and the texts and collections of texts with which they are compared. It focuses on style, diction, characterization, and interpretation of single works and across larger groups of texts, using both huge natural language corpora and smaller, more specialized collections of texts created for specific tasks, and applies statistical techniques used in the narrower confines of authorship attribution to broader stylistic questions. It addresses important issues in each of the three major literary genres, and intentionally applies different techniques and concepts to poetry, prose, and drama. It aims to present a provocative and suggestive sample intended to encourage the application of these and other methods to literary studies.     Hoover, Culpeper, and O\u2019Halloran push the methods, techniques, and concepts in new directions, apply them to new groups of texts or to new questions, modify their nature or method of application, and combine them in innovative ways.      Publisher's page           Elinor James   By Paula McDowell   This volume makes available for the first time the complete surviving works of the London printer-author Elinor James (c.1645-1719). Uniquely in the history of early modern women, James wrote, printed and distributed more than ninety pamphlets and broadsides addressing political, religious and commercial concerns. Written over a period of 35 years, her works provide us with a running commentary on the major national events of a tumultuous period such as the Revolution of 1688, the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, and the Jacobite uprisings in 1715-16. During her lifetime, England saw the succession of six different monarchs. James petitioned all of them and claimed to have obtained audiences with three. In 1689 she was gaoled in Newgate prison, accused of disseminating seditious material condemning William III for accepting the English crown.    James's texts address a staggeringly broad range of concerns. She petitioned Parliament concerning legislation affecting the printing trades and petitioned fellow printers concerning labour relations in London printing houses. She petitioned City authorities on issues such as the enforcement of bylaws or who to vote for in City and parliamentary elections. It is hoped that by making available all of James's known works, this volume will inspire the collective efforts of scholars from many different disciplines to decipher her references to contemporary events, issues and persons, as well as prompting further discoveries of as yet unidentified works.    Publisher\u2019s page              Epic Traditions in the Contemporary World: The Poetics of Community   By Susanne Wofford (co-edited with Margaret Beissinger and Jane Tylus)   The epic tradition has been part of many different cultures throughout human history. This noteworthy collection of essays provides a comparative reassessment of epic and its role in the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds, as it explores the variety of contemporary approaches to the epic genre. Employing theoretical perspectives drawn from anthropology, literary studies, and gender studies, the authors examine familiar and less well known oral and literary traditions\u2014ancient Greek and Latin, Arabic, South Slavic, Indian, Native American, Italian, English, and Caribbean\u2014demonstrating the continuing vitality of the epic tradition.    Juxtaposing work on the traditional canon of western epics with scholarship on contemporary epics from various parts of the world, these essays cross the divide between oral and literary forms that has long marked the approach to the genre. With its focus on the links among narrative, politics, and performance, the collection creates a new dialogue illustrating the sociopolitical significance of the epic tradition. Taken together, the essays raise compelling new issues for the study of epic, as they examine concerns such as national identity, gender, pedagogy, and the creation of the canon.    Publisher\u2019s page           Feeling Beauty: The Neuroscience of Aesthetic Experience   By G. Gabrielle Starr                         In Feeling Beauty, G. Gabrielle Starr   argues that understanding the neural underpinnings of aesthetic   experience can reshape our conceptions of aesthetics and the arts.   Drawing on the tools of both cognitive neuroscience and traditional   humanist inquiry, Starr shows that neuroaesthetics offers a new model   for understanding the dynamic and changing features of aesthetic life,   the relationships among the arts, and how individual differences in   aesthetic judgment shape the varieties of aesthetic experience.     Starr, a scholar of the humanities and a researcher in the   neuroscience of aesthetics, proposes that aesthetic experience relies on   a distributed neural architecture\u2014a set of brain areas involved in   emotion, perception, imagery, memory, and language. More important, it   emerges from networked interactions, intricately connected and   coordinated brain systems that together form a flexible architecture   enabling us to develop new arts and to see the world around us   differently. Focusing on the \u201csister arts\u201d of poetry, painting, and   music, Starr builds and tests a neural model of aesthetic experience   valid across all the arts. Asking why works that address different   senses using different means seem to produce the same set of feelings,   she examines particular works of art in a range of media, including a   poem by Keats, a painting by van Gogh, a sculpture by Bernini, and   Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations. Starr\u2019s innovative, interdisciplinary   analysis is true to the complexities of both the physical instantiation   of aesthetics and the realities of artistic representation. Publisher's Page                        Fieldworks: From Place to Site in Postwar Poetics   By Lytle Shaw   Fieldworks offers a historical account of the social, rhetorical, and material attempts to ground art and poetry in the physicality of a site. Arguing that place-oriented inquiries allowed poets and artists to develop new, experimental models of historiography and ethnography, Lytle Shaw draws out the shifting terms of this practice from World War II to the present through a series of illuminating case studies. Beginning with the alternate national genealogies unearthed by William Carlos Williams in Paterson and Charles Olson in Gloucester, Shaw demonstrates how subsequent poets sought to ground such inquiries in concrete social formations\u2014to in effect live the poetics of place: Gary Snyder in his back-to-the-land familial compound, Kitkitdizze; Amiri Baraka in a black nationalist community in Newark; Robert Creeley and the poets of Bolinas, California, in the capacious \u201cnow\u201d of their poet-run town. Turning to the work of Robert Smithson\u2014who called one of his essays an \u201cappendix to Paterson,\u201d and who in turn has exerted a major influence on poets since the 1970s\u2014Shaw then traces the emergence of site-specific art in relation both to the poetics of place and to the larger linguistic turn in the humanities, considering poets including Clark Coolidge, Bernadette Mayer, and Lisa Robertson. By putting the poetics of place into dialog with site-specificity in art, Shaw demonstrates how poets and artists became experimental explicators not just of concrete locations and their histories, but of the discourses used to interpret sites more broadly. It is this dual sense of fieldwork that organizes Shaw\u2019s groundbreaking history of site-specific poetry. Publisher's Page           Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies   By Elizabeth McHenry   Over the past decade the popularity of black writers including E. Lynn Harris and Terry McMillan has been hailed as an indication that an active African American reading public has come into being. Yet this is not a new trend; there is a vibrant history of African American literacy, literary associations, and book clubs. Forgotten Readers reveals that neglected past, looking at the reading practices of free blacks in the antebellum north and among African Americans following the Civil War. It places the black upper and middle classes within American literary history, illustrating how they used reading and literary conversation as a means to assert their civic identities and intervene in the political and literary cultures of the United States from which they were otherwise excluded. Forgotten Readers expands our definition of literacy and urges us to think of literature as broadly as it was conceived of in the nineteenth century. Elizabeth McHenry delves into archival sources, including the records of past literary societies and the unpublished writings of their members. She examines particular literary associations, including the Saturday Nighters of Washington, D.C., whose members included Jean Toomer and Georgia Douglas Johnson. She shows how black literary societies developed, their relationship to the black press, and the ways that African American women\u2019s clubs\u2014which flourished during the 1890s\u2014encouraged literary activity. In an epilogue, McHenry connects this rich tradition of African American interest in books, reading, and literary conversation to contemporary literary phenomena such as Oprah Winfrey\u2019s book club. Forgotten Readers redirects contemporary thinking about the origins of African American literature and adds a vital element to scholarship on the history of the book. Publisher\u2019s page           Frank O&rsquo;Hara: The Poetics of Coterie   By Lytle Shaw   O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems are famously filled with proper names\u2014from those of his immediate friends and colleagues in the New York writing and art worlds (John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Grace Hartigan, Willem de Kooning, and many musicians, dancers, and filmmakers) to a broad range of popular cultural and literary heroes (Apollinaire to Jackie O). But rather than understand O\u2019Hara\u2019s most commonly referenced names as a fixed and insular audience, Shaw argues that he uses the ambiguities of reference associated with the names to invent a fluid and shifting kinship structure\u2014one that opened up radical possibilities for a gay writer operating outside the structure of the family.    As Shaw demonstrates, this commitment to an experimental model of association also guides O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing. Like his poetry, O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing too has been condemned as insular, coterie writing. In fact, though, he was alone among 1950s critics in his willingness to consider abstract expressionism not only within the dominant languages of existentialism and formalism but also within the cold war political and popular cultural frameworks that anticipate many of the concerns of contemporary art historians. Situating O\u2019Hara within a range of debates about art\u2019s possible relations to its audience, Shaw demonstrates that his interest in coterie is less a symptomatic offshoot of his biography than a radical literary and artistic invention.    Publisher\u2019s page           From Philology to English Studies: Language and Culture in the Nineteenth Century   By Haruko Momma   The study of English language and literature in Britain changed dramatically between the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. From Philology to English Studies explores the contribution of philology to this evolution. Haruko Momma charts both the rise and fall of philology from antiquity to the late eighteenth century, and the impact of modern philology on the study of modern languages and literatures. Focusing in detail on the work of key philologists in the nineteenth century, Momma considers how they shaped European discourse and especially vernacular studies in Britain: William Jones' discovery of Sanskrit in British India gave rise to Indo-European studies; Max M\u00fcller's study of this same language helped spread the Aryan myth to the English-speaking world; the OED achieved its greatness as a post-national lexicon through the editorship of the Scottish dialectologist. Publisher's Page           Genres of the Credit Economy: Mediating Value in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain   By Mary Poovey   How did banking, borrowing, investing, and even losing money\u2014in other words, participating in the modern financial system\u2014come to seem like routine activities of everyday life? Genres of the Credit Economy addresses this question by examining the history of financial instruments and representations of finance in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. Chronicling the process by which some of our most important conceptual categories were naturalized, Mary Poovey explores complex relationships among forms of writing that are not usually viewed together, from bills of exchange and bank checks, to realist novels and Romantic poems, to economic theory and financial journalism. Taking up all early forms of financial and monetary writing, Poovey argues that these genres mediated for early modern Britons the operations of a market system organized around credit and debt. By arguing that genre is a critical tool for historical and theoretical analysis and an agent in the events that formed the modern world, Poovey offers a new way to appreciate the character of the credit economy and demonstrates the contribution historians and literary scholars can make to understanding its operations. Much more than an exploration of writing on and around money, Genres of the Credit Economy offers startling insights about the evolution of disciplines and the separation of factual and fictional genres.    Publisher\u2019s page           Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England   By Juliet Fleming   Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England is an   excavation of a series of previously unknown or disregarded writing   practices. Our modern assumptions regarding written expression have   limited our examination of the history of writing and literacy to that   which has been preserved in print or manuscript. In a work of tremendous   originality and intellectual daring, Fleming brings detailed historical   scholarship into dialogue with the challenge of contemporary theory to   explore a lost realm where writing practices moved off the boundaries of   the page to fill windows, body surfaces, ceramics, ceilings, and walls. Developing   and drawing on an archive that has until now been closed to literary   scholars, Fleming argues that the whitewashed wall was the primary   writing apparatus of the early modern English, recovers the tattoo   practices of sixteenth-century Europeans, and demonstrates how to read   the poetic burden of early modern crockery. Her book is a work of   cultural history that provides a startling new perspective on early   modern writing, one that swerves from the preoccupations of generations   of scholars in order to transform the fundamental terms of literary   inquiry.

Publisher\u2019s page           Heart Beats: Everyday Life and the Memorized Poem   By Catherine Robson   Many people in Great Britain and the United States can recall elderly relatives who remembered long stretches of verse learned at school decades earlier, yet most of us were never required to recite in class. Heart Beats is the first book to examine how poetry recitation came to assume a central place in past curricular programs, and to investigate when and why the once-mandatory exercise declined. Telling the story of a lost pedagogical practice and its wide-ranging effects on two sides of the Atlantic, Catherine Robson explores how recitation altered the ordinary people who committed poems to heart, and changed the worlds in which they lived. Heart Beats begins by investigating recitation's progress within British and American public educational systems over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and weighs the factors that influenced which poems were most frequently assigned. Robson then scrutinizes the recitational fortunes of three short works that were once classroom classics: Felicia Hemans's \"Casabianca,\" Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,\" and Charles Wolfe's \"Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna.\" To conclude, the book considers W. E. Henley's \"Invictus\" and Rudyard Kipling's \"If--,\" asking why the idea of the memorized poem arouses such different responses in the United States and Great Britain today. Focusing on vital connections between poems, individuals, and their communities, Heart Beats is an important study of the history and power of memorized poetry. Publisher's Page           Heartbreakers: Women and Violence in Contemporary Culture and Literature   By Josephine Gattuso Hendin   From   Medea to Goneril to Sharon Stone's ice-pick murderer, the violent woman   has fascinated readers and audiences. Josephine Hendin looks at this   figure and argues that a violent woman is a grenade pitched toward both   conservative and liberal views of women.                                 Publisher's Page           How Soon is Now? Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and The Queerness of Time   By Carolyn Dinshaw   How Soon Is Now? performs a powerful critique of modernist temporal regimes through its revelatory exploration of queer ways of being in time as well as of the potential queerness of time itself. Carolyn Dinshaw focuses on medieval tales of asynchrony and on engagements with these medieval temporal worlds by amateur readers centuries later. In doing so, she illuminates forms of desirous, embodied being that are out of sync with ordinarily linear measurements of everyday life, that involve multiple temporalities, that precipitate out of time altogether. Dinshaw claims the possibility of a fuller, denser, more crowded now that theorists tell us is extant but that often eludes our temporal grasp. Whether discussing Victorian men of letters who parodied the Book of John Mandeville, a fictionalized fourteenth-century travel narrative, or Hope Emily Allen, modern coeditor of the early-fifteenth-century Book of Margery Kempe, Dinshaw argues that these and other medievalists outside the academy inhabit different temporalities than modern professionals operating according to the clock. How Soon Is Now? clears space for amateurs, hobbyists, and dabblers who approach medieval worlds from positions of affect and attachment, from desires to build other kinds of worlds. Unruly, untimely, they urge us toward a disorderly and asynchronous collective Publisher's page           Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix   By Martha Rust   This book envisions the confines of medieval manuscripts as the potential territory of many virtual worlds: realms that readers call forth through their imaginative interactions with a book\u2019s material features. Each component of a medieval manuscript--its alphabetical characters, pages, images, text, gloss--offers an avenue of involvement with the world of books, and with the worldsin books. The explorations presented here follow those paths in a selection of manuscripts and texts produced in late-medieval Britain, tracing the fortunes of characters who become subject to and sometimes subjects in the very books the read and write.    Publisher\u2019s page           In Visible Movement   By Tom&aacute;s Urayo&aacute;n Noel   The first book-length study specifically devoted to Nuyorican poetry, In Visible Movement    is unique in its historical and formal breadth, ranging from the   foundational poets of the 1960s and 1970s to a variety of contemporary   poets emerging in and around the Nuyorican Poets Cafe \u201cslam\u201d scene of   the 1990s and early 2000s. It also unearths a largely unknown corpus of   poetry performances, reading over forty years of Nuyorican poetry at the   intersection of the printed and performed word, underscoring the   poetry\u2019s links to vernacular and Afro-Puerto Rican performance cultures,   from the island\u2019s oral poets to the New York sounds and rhythms of   Latin boogaloo, salsa, and hip-hop. With depth and insight, Urayo\u00e1n Noel   analyzes various canonical Nuyorican poems by poets such as Pedro   Pietri, Victor Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, Miguel Algar\u00edn, Miguel Pi\u00f1ero, Sandra   Mar\u00eda Esteves, and Tato Laviera. He discusses historically overlooked   poets such as Lorraine Sutton, innovative poets typically read outside   the Nuyorican tradition such as Frank Lima and Edwin Torres, and a   younger generation of Nuyorican-identified poets including Willie   Perdomo, Mar\u00eda Teresa Mariposa Fern\u00e1ndez, and Emanuel Xavier, whose work   has received only limited critical consideration. The result is a   stunning reflection of how New York Puerto Rican poets have addressed   the complexity of identity amid diaspora for over forty years.           Land/Scape/Theater   By Una Chaudhuri (Co-edited with Elinor Fuchs)   Land/Scape/Theater proposes landscape as a necessary paradigm for understanding modern theater's increasingly spatialized aesthetic as well as its engagement with the cultural meanings of place and space.    Embracing subjects as diverse as the \"landscape dramaturgy\" of Suzan-Lori Parks, Artaud's trip to the Sierra Madre,Gertrude Stein's landscape theory and practice, Guillermo Gomez-Pe\u00f1a's \"border subjects,\" and Bayreuth and Disneyland as cultic sites, Land/Scape/Theater draws on a broad range of theory, dramatic texts, and performance. All aspects of modern theater, these essays suggest, including the bedrock Aristotelian constituents of plot and character, have a landscape dimension that often goes unrecognized.    With its broad theoretical range and cross-disciplinary reach, Land/Scape/Theater will interest theater theorists and practitioners and cultural studies specialists, including historians of landscape. Theater students, scholars, teachers, directors, designers, and actors will find here a new framework and a new vocabulary for understanding both theater and the larger culture.    Publisher\u2019s page           London Calling: How Black and Asian Writers Imagined a City   By Sukhdev Sandhu   From the 11th century, when one commentator claimed the capital was being over-run with Moors, to the garage MCs and street poets of today \u2013 this book tells the story of life in London for black and Asian people from the seventeenth century until today. London Calling tells the story of black and Asian literary London, tracing the escapades, fortune making, and self-expansion of these forgotten writers. It is a joyful and often rapturous work, a love letter to the capital, a teeming and complex mix of social and cultural history seen through the imagination and experience of great black and Asian writers. London Calling gets to the heart of the immigration impulse, and evokes the dreams and adventures of those who have sought refuge and asylum in the cradle of Empire. The book is populated by runaway slaves, lotharios, imams, boxer-pimps, rajahs and colonial revolutionaries, and discusses writers as diverse in style and time as the 18th-century grocer-aesthete Ignatius Sancho right through to Rushdie, Kureishi and yardie chronicler Victor Headley. The result is an exciting work, brimming with life, as it spotlights a rich but neglected literary tradition, and brings to life a gaping void in the city's history. Placing the multiculturalism of today's capital in its historical context, Sukhdev Sandhu shows that it is no new phenomenon, and that just as London has been the making of many black writers, they too have been the making of London.    Publisher's page           Lyric Generations: Poetry and the Novel in the Long Eighteenth Century   By Gabrielle Starr   Eighteenth\u2014century British literary history is traditionally characterized by two central and seemingly discrete movements: the rise of the novel and the development of Romantic lyric poetry. In fact, recent scholarship reveals that these genres are inextricably bound: constructions of interiority developed in novels changed ideas about what literature could mean and do, encouraging the new focus on private experience and self\u2014perception developed in lyric poetry.    In Lyric Generations Gabrielle Starr rejects the usual genealogy of lyric poetry in which Romantic poets are thought to have built solely and directly upon the works of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton. She argues instead that novelists such as Richardson, Haywood, Behn and others, while drawing upon earlier lyric conventions, ushered in a new language of self\u2014expression and community that profoundly affected the aesthetic goals of lyric poets. Examining the works of Cowper, Smith, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats in light of their competitive dialogue with the novel, Starr advances a literary history that considers formal characteristics as products of historical change. In a world increasingly defined by prose, poets adapted the new forms, characters, and moral themes of the novel in order to reinvigorate poetic practice. Publisher\u2019s page           Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentleman   By Catherine Robson   Fascination with little girls pervaded Victorian culture. For many, girls represented the true essence of childhood or bygone times of innocence; but for middle-class men, especially writers, the interest ran much deeper. In Men in Wonderland, Catherine Robson explores the ways in which various nineteenth-century British male authors constructed girlhood, and analyzes the nature of their investment in the figure of the girl. In so doing, she reveals the link between the idealization of little girls and a widespread fantasy of male development--a myth suggesting that men become masculine only after an initial feminine stage, lived out in the protective environment of the nursery. Little girls, argues Robson, thus offer an adult male the best opportunity to reconnect with his own lost self.    Tracing the beginnings of this myth in the writings of Romantics Wordsworth and De Quincey, Robson identifies the consolidation of this paradigm in numerous Victorian artifacts, ranging from literary works by Dickens and Barrett Browning, to paintings by Frith and Millais, to reports of the Royal Commission on Children's Employment. She analyzes Ruskin and Carroll's \"high noon\" of girl worship and investigates the destruction of the fantasy in the closing decades of the century, when social concerns about the working girl sexualized the image of young females.    Men in Wonderland contributes to a growing interest in the nineteenth century's construction of childhood, sexuality, and masculinity, and illuminates their complex interconnections with a startlingly different light. Not only does it complicate the narratives of pedophilic desire that are generally used to explain figures like Ruskin and Carroll, but it offers a new understanding of the Victorian era's obsession with loss, its rampant sentimentality, and its intense valorization of the little girl at the expense of mature femininity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Middle English Literature: A Cultural History   By Christopher Cannon   Polity, 2008. This book provides a boldly original account of Middle English literature from the Norman Conquest to the beginning of the sixteenth century. It argues that these centuries are, in fundamental ways, the momentous period in our literary history, for they are the long moment in which the category of literature itself emerged as English writing began to insist, for the first time, that it floated free of any social reality or function. This book also charts the complex mechanisms by which English writing acquired this power in a series of linked close readings of both canonical and more obscure texts. It encloses those readings in five compelling accounts of much broader cultural areas, describing, in particular, the productive relationship of Middle English writing to medieval technology, insurgency, statecraft and cultural place, concluding with an in depth account of the particular arguments, emphases and techniques English writers used to claim a wholly new jurisdiction for their work. Both this history and its readings are everywhere informed by the most exciting developments in recent Middle English scholarship as well as literary and cultural theory. It serves as an introduction to all these areas as well as a contribution, in its own right, to each of them. Publisher\u2019s page           Modernisms: A Literary Guide   By Peter Nicholls   University of California, 2009. The recent enthusiasm for things postmodern has often produced a caricature of Modernism as monolithic and reactionary. Peter Nicholls argues instead that the distinctive feature of Modernism is its diversity. Through a lively analysis of each of Modernism's main literary movements, he explores the connections between the new stylistic developments and the shifting politics of gender and authority.\u2028\u2028Nicholls introduces a wealth of literary experimentation, beginning with Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9 and moving forward to the first avant-gardes. Close readings of key texts monitor the explosive histories of Futurism, Expressionism, Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism, histories that allow Anglo-American Modernism to be seen in a strikingly different light. In revealing Modernism's broad and varied terrain, Nicholls evokes the richness of a cultural moment that continues to shape our own. Publisher\u2019s page           My Poets   By Maureen N. McLane   \u201cOh! there are spirits of the air,\u201d wrote Percy Bysshe Shelley. In this stunningly original book, Maureen N. McLane channels the spirits and voices that make up the music in one poet\u2019s mind. Weaving criticism and memoir, My Poets explores a life reading and a life read. McLane invokes not necessarily the best poets, nor the most important poets (whoever these might be), but those writers who, in possessing her, made her. \u201cI am marking here what most marked me,\u201d she writes. Ranging from Chaucer to H.D. to William Carlos Williams to Louise Gl\u00fcck to Shelley (among others), McLane tracks the \u201cgrowth of a poet\u2019s mind,\u201d as Wordsworth put it in The Prelude. In poetical prose both probing and incantatory, McLane has written a radical book of experimental criticism. Susan Sontag called for an \u201cerotics of interpretation\u201d: this is it. Part Bildung, part dithyramb, part exegesis, My Poets extends an implicit invitation to you, dear reader, to consider who your \u201cmy poets,\u201d or \u201cmy novelists,\u201d or \u201cmy filmmakers,\u201d or \u201cmy pop stars,\u201d might be. Publisher's Page           Negative Liberties: Morrison, Pynchon, and the Problem of Liberal Ideology   By Cyrus R. K. Patell   Since the nineteenth century, ideas centered on the individual, on Emersonian self-reliance, and on the right of the individual to the pursuit of happiness have had a tremendous presence in the United States\u2014and even more so after the Reagan era. But has this presence been for the good of all? In Negative Liberties Cyrus R. K. Patell revises important ideas in the debate about individualism and the political theory of liberalism. He does so by adding two new voices to the current discussion\u2014Toni Morrison and Thomas Pynchon\u2014to examine the different ways in which their writings embody, engage, and critique the official narrative generated by U.S. liberal ideology.    Pynchon and Morrison reveal the official narrative of individualism as encompassing a complex structure of contradiction held in abeyance. This narrative imagines that the goals of the individual are not at odds with the goals of the family or society and in fact obscures the existence of an unholy truce between individual liberty and forms of oppression. By bringing these two fiction writers into a discourse dominated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Isaiah Berlin, John Rawls, George Kateb, Robert Bellah, and Michael Sandel, Patell unmasks the ways in which contemporary U.S. culture has not fully shed the oppressive patterns of reasoning handed down by the slaveholding culture from which American individualism emerged. With its interdisciplinary approach, Negative Liberties will appeal to students and scholars of American literature, culture, sociology, and politics.    Publisher\u2019s page           Nineteenth-Century Lives   By Laurence S. Lockridge   In Nineteenth-Century Lives ten distinguished critics and biographers consider what it means to narrate a life. Their illustrative texts are largely taken from nineteenth-century biography, autobiography and the novel, but narrative is the broader genre that unites their various inquiries. The principal issues, theoretical and practical, are framed by Margaret Atwood, J. Hillis Miller and Phyllis Rose. 'The biographer, like the novelist, is a constructor of narratives; it's just that the ground rules are a little different,' writes Atwood. Among the matters they debate are the boundaries of fact and fiction, the professed power of the narrator, and the figurative underpinings of autobiography. But many of these essays are delightful and provocative biographical and autobiographical excursions in themselves. Atwood describes her early fear of biography, Morton Cohen narrates an exciting bit of detective work into the life of Lewis Carroll, and John Rosenberg gives a vivid and frequently revisionary reading of many aspects of Darwin's life. Other critics - Carl Woodring, Richard Altick, Norman Kelvin, Margaret Stetz, and Robert Kiely - consider related topics: the autobiographical poem as Bildungsroman, the nineteenth-century art biography, the relationship of William Morris's life to the structural principles of his art, the guilt-ridden fiction of the 1890s, and a seemingly marginal character in fiction, the 'nobody'.    Publisher\u2019s page           On Eloquence   By Denis Donoghue   On Eloquence questions the common assumption that eloquence is merely a subset of rhetoric, a means toward a rhetorical end. Denis Donoghue, an eminent and prolific critic of the English language, holds that this assumption is erroneous. While rhetoric is the use of language to persuade people to do one thing rather than another, Donoghue maintains that eloquence is \u201cgratuitous, ideally autonomous, in speech and writing an upsurge of creative vitality for its own sake.\u201d He offers many instances of eloquence in words, and suggests the forms our appreciation of them should take.    Donoghue argues persuasively that eloquence matters, that we should indeed care about it. \u201cBecause we should care about any instances of freedom, independence, creative force, sprezzatura,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially when we live\u2014perhaps this is increasingly the case\u2014in a culture of the same, featuring official attitudes, stereotypes of the officially enforced values, sedated language, a politics of pacification.\u201d A noteworthy addition to Donoghue\u2019s long-term project to reclaim a disinterested appreciation of literature as literature, this volume is a wise and pleasurable meditation on eloquence, its unique ability to move or give pleasure, and its intrinsic value. Publisher\u2019s page           Plague Writing in Early Modern England   By Ernest B. Gilman   University of Chicago, 2009. During the seventeenth century, England was beset by three epidemics of the bubonic plague, each outbreak claiming between a quarter and a third of the population of London and other urban centers. Surveying a wide range of responses to these epidemics\u2014sermons, medical tracts, pious exhortations, satirical pamphlets, and political commentary\u2014Plague Writing in Early Modern England brings to life the many and complex ways Londoners made sense of such unspeakable devastation. Ernest B. Gilman argues that the plague writing of the period attempted unsuccessfully to rationalize the catastrophic and that its failure to account for the plague as an instrument of divine justice fundamentally threatened the core of Christian belief. Gilman also trains his critical eye on the works of Jonson, Donne, Pepys, and Defoe, which, he posits, can be more fully understood when put into the context of this century-long project to \u201cwrite out\u201d the plague. Ultimately, Plague Writing in Early Modern England is more than a compendium of artifacts of a bygone era; it holds up a distant mirror to reflect our own condition in the age of AIDS, super viruses, multidrug resistant tuberculosis, and the hovering threat of a global flu pandemic. Publisher's page           Private Affairs: Critical Ventures in the Culture of Social Relations   By Phillip Brian Harper   In Private Affairs, Phillip Brian Harper explores the social and cultural significance of the private, proposing that, far from a universal right, privacy is limited by one's racial-and sexual-minority status. Ranging across cinema, literature, sculpture, and lived encounters-from Rodin's The Kiss to Jenny Livingston's Paris is Burning-Private Affairs demonstrates how the very concept of privacy creates personal and sociopolitical hierarchies in contemporary America. Publisher\u2019s page           Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Making of American Literature   By Bryan Waterman   In the 1790s, a single conversational circle -- the Friendly Club -- united New York City's most ambitious young writers, and in Republic of Intellect, Bryan Waterman uses an innovative blend of literary criticism and historical narrative to re\u2014create the club's intellectual culture. The story of the Friendly Club reveals the mutually informing conditions of authorship, literary association, print culture, and production of knowledge in a specific time and place -- the tumultuous, tenuous world of post\u2014revolutionary New York City. More than any similar group in the early American republic, the Friendly Club occupied a crossroads -- geographical, professional, and otherwise -- of American literary and intellectual culture.    Waterman argues that the relationships among club members' novels, plays, poetry, diaries, legal writing, and medical essays lead to important first examples of a distinctively American literature and also illuminate the local, national, and transatlantic circuits of influence and information that club members called \"the republic of intellect.\" He addresses topics ranging from political conspiracy in the gothic novels of Charles Brockden Brown to the opening of William Dunlap's Park Theatre, from early American debates on gendered conversation to the publication of the first American medical journal. Voluntary association and print culture helped these young New Yorkers, Waterman concludes, to produce a broader and more diverse post\u2014revolutionary public sphere than scholars have yet recognized. Publisher\u2019s page           Securing the Commonwealth: Debt, Speculation, and Writing in the Making of Early America   By Jennifer J. Baker   Securing the Commonwealth examines how eighteenth\u2014century American writers understood the highly speculative financial times in which they lived. Spanning a century of cultural and literary life, this study shows how the era's literature commonly depicted an American ethos of risk taking and borrowing as the peculiar product of New World daring and the exigencies of revolution and nation building.    Some of the century's most important writers, including Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin, Royall Tyler, Charles Brockden Brown, and Judith Sargent Murray, believed that economic and social commonwealth -- and one's commitment to that commonwealth -- might be grounded in indebtedness and financial insecurity. These writers believed a cash\u2014poor colony or nation could not only advance itself through borrowing but also gain reputability each time it successfully paid off a loan. Equally important, they believed that debt could promote communality: precarious public credit structures could exact popular commitment; intricate financial networks could bind individuals to others and to their government; and indebtedness itself could evoke sympathy for the suffering of others.    Close readings of their literary works reveal how these writers imagined that public life might be shaped by economic experience, and how they understood the public life of literature itself. Insecure times strengthened their conviction that writing could be publicly serviceable, persuading readers to invest in their government, in their fellow Americans, and in the idea of America itself.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing   By Carolyn Dinshaw (Co-edited with David Wallace)   The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing seeks to recover the lives and particular experiences of medieval women by concentrating on various kinds of texts: the texts they wrote themselves as well as texts that attempted to shape, limit, or expand their lives. The first section investigates the roles traditionally assigned to medieval women (as virgins, widows, and wives); it also considers female childhood and relations between women. The second section explores social spaces, including textuality itself: for every surviving medieval manuscript bespeaks collaborative effort. It considers women as authors, as anchoresses 'dead to the world', and as preachers and teachers in the world staking claims to authority without entering a pulpit. The final section considers the lives and writings of remarkable women, including Marie de France, Heloise, Joan of Arc, Julian of Norwich, Margery Kempe, and female lyricists and romancers whose names are lost, but whose texts survive.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in Nineteenth-Century America   By Thomas Augst   Thousands of men left their families for the bustling cities of nineteenth-century America, where many of them found work as clerks. The Clerk's Tale recounts their remarkable story, describing the struggle of aspiring businessmen to come of age at the dawn of the modern era. How did these young men understand the volatile world of American capitalism and make sense of their place within it?    Thomas Augst follows clerks as they made their way through the boarding houses, parlors, and offices of the big city. Tracing the course of their everyday lives, Augst shows how these young men used acts of reading and writing to navigate the anonymous world of market culture and claim identities for themselves within it. Clerks, he reveals, calculated their prospects in diaries, composed detailed letters to friends and family, attended lectures by key thinkers of the day, joined libraries where they consumed fiction, all while wrestling with the boredom of their work. What results, then, is a poignant look at the literary practices of ordinary people and an affecting meditation on the moral lives of men in antebellum America.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Idea of English Ethnicity   By Robert J.C. Young   In this major contribution to debates about English identity, leading theorist Robert J.C. Young argues that Englishness was never really about England at all. In the nineteenth century, it was rather developed as a form of long-distance identity for the English diaspora around the world. Young shows how the effects of this continue to reverberate today, nationally and globally. Publisher\u2019s page           The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel   By Elaine Freedgood   While the Victorian novel famously describes, catalogs, and inundates the reader with things, the protocols for reading it have long enjoined readers not to interpret most of what crowds its pages. The Ideas in Things explores apparently inconsequential objects in popular Victorian texts to make contact with their fugitive meanings. Developing an innovative approach to analyzing nineteenth-century fiction, Elaine Freedgood here reconnects the things readers unwittingly ignore to the stories they tell.    Building her case around objects from three well-known Victorian novels\u2014the mahogany furniture in Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre, the calico curtains in Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s Mary Barton, and \u201cNegro head\u201d tobacco in Charles Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations\u2014Freedgood argues that these things are connected to histories that the novels barely acknowledge, generating darker meanings outside the novels\u2019 symbolic systems. A valuable contribution to the new field of object studies in the humanities, The Ideas in Things pushes readers\u2019 thinking about things beyond established concepts of commodity and fetish. Publisher\u2019s page           The New Asian City: Three-Dimensional Fictions of Space and Urban Form   By Jini Kim Watson     Under Jini Kim Watson\u2019s scrutiny, the Asian Tiger metropolises of Seoul,   Taipei, and Singapore reveal a surprising residue of the colonial   environment. Drawing on a wide array of literary, filmic, and political   works, and juxtaposing close readings of the built environment, Watson   demonstrates how processes of migration and construction in the   hypergrowth urbanscapes of the Pacific Rim crystallize the psychic and   political dramas of their colonized past and globalized present.   Tracing the way newly constructed spaces\u2014including expressways,   high-rises, factory zones, and department stores\u2014become figured within   cultural texts, The New Asian City explores how urban   transformations were rationalized, perceived, and fictionalized. Watson   shows how literature, film, and poetry have described and challenged   contemporary Asian metropolises, especially around the formation of   gendered and laboring subjects in these new spaces. She suggests that by   embracing the postwar growth-at-any-cost imperative, they have   buttressed the nationalist enterprise along neocolonial lines.       The New Asian City provides an innovative approach to how we   might better understand the gleaming metropolises of the Pacific Rim. In   doing so, it demonstrates how reading cultural production in   conjunction with built environments can enrich our knowledge of the   lived consequences of rapid economic and urban development. Publisher's page           The Scandal of the State: Women, Law, and Citizenship in Postcolonial India   By Rajeswari Sunder Rajan   The Scandal of the State is a revealing study of the relationship between the postcolonial, democratic Indian nation-state and Indian women\u2019s actual needs and lives. Well-known for her work combining feminist theory and postcolonial studies, Rajeswari Sunder Rajan shows how the state is central to understanding women\u2019s identities and how, reciprocally, women and \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d affect the state\u2019s role and function. She argues that in India law and citizenship define for women not only the scope of political rights but also cultural identity and everyday life. Sunder Rajan delineates the postcolonial state in implicit contrast with the \u201cenlightened,\u201d postfeminist neoliberal state in the West. Her analysis wrestles with complex social realities, taking into account the influence of age, ethnicity, religion, and class on individual and group identities as well as the shifting, heterogeneous nature of the state itself. The Scandal of the State develops through a series of compelling case studies, each of which centers around an incident exposing the contradictory position of the Indian state vis-\u00e0-vis its female citizens and, ultimately, the inadequacy of its commitment to women\u2019s rights. Sunder Rajan focuses on the custody battle over a Muslim child bride, the compulsory sterilization of mentally retarded women in state institutional care, female infanticide in Tamilnadu, prostitution as labor rather than crime, and the surrender of the female outlaw Phoolan Devi. She also looks at the ways the Uniform Civil Code presented many women with a stark choice between allegiance to their religion and community or the secular assertion of individual rights. Rich with theoretical acumen and activist passion, The Scandal of the State is a powerful critique of the mutual dependence of women and the state on one another in the specific context of a postcolonial modernity. Publisher\u2019s page           The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter   By Patricia Crain   Richly illustrated with often antic images from alphabet books and primers, The Story of A relates the history of the alphabet as a genre of text for children and of alphabetization as a social practice in America, from early modern reading primers to the literature of the American Renaissance.   Offering a poetics of alphabetization and explicating the alphabet's tropes and rhetorical strategies, the author demonstrates the far-reaching cultural power of such apparently neutral statements as \u201cA is for apple.\u201d The new market for children's books in the eighteenth century established for the \u201crepublic of ABC\u201d a cultural potency equivalent to its high-culture counterpart, the \u201crepublic of letters,\u201d while shaping its child-readers into consumers. As a central rite of socialization, alphabetization schooled children to conflicting expectations, as well as to changing models of authority, understandings of the world, and uses of literature.   In the nineteenth century, literacy became a crucial aspect of American middle-class personality and subjectivity. Furnishing the readers and writers needed for a national literature, the alphabetization of America between 1800 and 1850 informed the sentimental-reform novel as well as the self-consciously aesthetic novel of the 1850s. Through readings of conduct manuals, reading primers, and a sentimental bestseller, the author shows how the alphabet became embedded in a maternal narrative, which organized the world through domestic affections.   Nathaniel Hawthorne, by contrast, insisted on the artificiality of the alphabet and its practices in his antimimetic, hermetic The Scarlet Letter, with its insistent focus on the letter A. By understanding this novel as part of the network of alphabetization, The Story of A accounts for its uniquely persistent cultural role. The author concludes, in an epilogue, with a reading of postmodern alphabets and their implications for the future of literacy.   Publisher\u2019s page           The Work of Writing: Literature and Social Change 1700-1830   By Clifford Siskin   \"The Work of Writing is a deeply mature piece of scholarship involving dozens upon dozens of authors from all over the long eighteenth century. Not only is its sense of the 'textual' very broad, ranging from literature, to philosophy (which, Siskin argues, once occupied the disciplinary space that Literature does today), to economics and sociology, but in requiring that we wake up and think about enlightenment processes of cultural formation, it is itself exemplary of that process. Thinking very hard and on every page, it passes its own test in an exhilarating manner.\" -- Stuart Curran, University of Pennsylvania    \"The Work of Writing establishes Cliff Siskin as one of our most subtle and theoretically sophisticated scholars of Romantic cultural studies and the New Historicism. This book, breath\u2014taking in its range, documents the growing professionalisation of writing in England in the eighteenth\u2014century, as well as the ways in which both nationalist and entrepreneurial impulses worked to exclude women writers from the new category of 'professional writer' in the nineteenth century.\" -- Anne K. Mellor, University of California, Los Angeles Publisher\u2019s page           This Is Enlightenment   By Clifford Siskin (co-edited with William Warner)   Debates about the nature of the Enlightenment date to the eighteenth century, when Imanual Kant himself addressed the question, \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d The contributors to this ambitious book offer a paradigm-shifting answer to that now-famous query: Enlightenment is an event in the history of mediation. Enlightenment, they argue, needs to be engaged within the newly broad sense of mediation introduced here\u2014not only oral, visual, written, and printed media, but everything that intervenes, enables, supplements, or is simply in between. With essays addressing infrastructure and genres, associational practices and protocols, this volume establishes mediation as the condition of possibility for enlightenment. In so doing, it not only answers Kant\u2019s query; it also poses its own broader question: how would foregrounding mediation change the kinds and areas of inquiry in our own epoch? This Is Enlightenment is a landmark volume with the polemical force and archival depth to start a conversation that extends across the disciplines that the Enlightenment itself first configured. Publisher's page           Untouchable Fictions: Literary Realism and the Crisis of Caste   By Toral Jatin Gajarawala   Untouchable Fictions considers the crisis of literary realism- progressive, rural, regionalist, experimental- in order to derive a literary genealogy for the recent explosion of Dalit (\u201cuntouchable\u201d caste) fiction. Drawing on a wide array of fiction from Premchand and Renu in Hindi to Mulk Raj Anand and V.S. Naipaul in English, Gajarawala illuminates the dark side of realist complicity: a hidden aesthetics and politics of caste. How does caste color the novel? What are its formal tendencies? What generic constraints does it produce? Untouchable Fictions juxtaposes the Dalit text, and its radical critique, with a history of progressive literary movements in South Asia. Gajarawala reads Dalit writing dialectically, doing justice to its unique and groundbreaking literary interventions while also demanding that it be read as an integral moment in the literary genealogy of the 20th and 21st century. How might we trace the origins of the rise of Dalit fiction in the critical \u201crealism\u201d of the Progressive Writers Association of the 1930s, or in the gaps laid bare by the peasant novel of the 1950s? And what kind of dialogue does \u201cuntouchable caste\u201d writing with its more famous counterpart: the Anglophone fiction of the last few decades? Under Gajarawala\u2019s lens the aesthetic languages of Hindi and English are intertwined and caste becomes a central category of literary analysis. This book, grounded in the fields of postcolonial theory, South Asian literatures, and cultural studies will be important for all readers interested in the problematic relations between aesthetics and politics, between social movements and cultural production. Engaged as it is with contemporary theories of realism and the problem of aesthetics, it would also be of interest to students of English, comparative literature, contemporary Third World literature, and historians of literary movements. More specifically, as a text that considers recent developments in genre theory and South Asian fiction, it would interest scholars of the Indian and Indian Anglophone novel. Finally, this project, as an interrogation of caste politics in the cultural sphere, is an important contribution to the burgeoning field of Dalit studies. Publisher's Page           Victorian Discourses on Sexuality and Religion   By John Maynard   John Maynard's original and provocative study looks at sexuality and religion as creations of language, in the literary and cultural discourses of Victorian England. After a wide-ranging introduction (drawing on myth, anthropology, comparative religion and the history of sexuality) Maynard goes on to articulate and interpret the strikingly complex and varied ways in which the earnest sceptic Arthur Hugh Clough, the Protestant Charles Kingsley, and the Catholic convert Coventry Patmore placed the relation of sexuality and religion at the centre of their work. A final chapter on Jude the Obscure demonstrates Thomas Hardy's deconstruction of the endeavour to make sense of sexuality and religion, fragmenting this inherited discourse into mere words and bodily parts, in a disintegration of the great constructive vision of his predecessors.

Gladstein and Dara Rossman Regaignon   Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges   presents an empirical study of the writing programs at one hundred   small, private liberal arts colleges. Jill M. Gladstein and Dara Rossman   Regaignon provide detailed information about a type of writing program   not often highlighted in the scholarly record and offer a model for such   national, multi-institutional research. Utilizing the mixed methods   approach of grounded theory, Gladstein and Regaignon weave together   survey, interview, and focus group data, site document analysis, and   institutional history. They describe the writing programs at small   colleges today as being dominated by writing across the curriculum-based   approaches to writing instruction and the writing centers as   emphasizing peer tutoring, and hence the development of undergraduate   students as leaders and scholars. For small colleges, the movement   toward vertical writing curricula, professionalized leadership   positions, and innovative writing assessments occurs when institutions   deepen or reaffirm their commitment to writing across the curriculum. In   addition, Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges offers a heuristic for understanding and comparing writing programs within and across institutions.

We live in the era of Big Data, with storage and transmission capacity measured not just in terabytes but in petabytes (where peta -   denotes a quadrillion, or a thousand trillion). Data collection is   constant and even insidious, with every click and every \u201clike\u201d stored   somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but   \u201craw,\u201d that we shouldn\u2019t think of data as a natural resource but as a   cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The   book\u2019s essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the   predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways   that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are   mutually defining; how data are variously \u201ccooked\u201d in the processes of   their collection and use; and conflicts over what can\u2014or can\u2019t\u2014be   \u201creduced\u201d to data.

Williams Publisher's Page                        A Companion to the History of the English Language   By Haruko Momma (Co-edited with Michael Matto)   A Companion to the History of the English Language addresses the linguistic, cultural, social, and literary approaches to language study.

Using the examples of early recorded sound and digital networks, Gitelman challenges readers to think about the ways that media work as the simultaneous subjects and instruments of historical inquiry. Presenting original case studies of Edison's first phonographs and the Pentagon's first distributed digital network, the ARPANET, Gitelman points suggestively toward similarities that underlie the cultural definition of records (phonographic and not) at the end of the nineteenth century and the definition of documents (digital and not) at the end of the twentieth. As a result, Always Already New speaks to present concerns about the humanities as much as to the emergent field of new media studies. Records and documents are kernels of humanistic thought, after all\u2014part of and party to the cultural impulse to preserve and interpret. Gitelman's argument suggests inventive contexts for \"humanities computing\" while also offering a new perspective on such traditional humanities disciplines as literary history.    Making extensive use of archival sources, Gitelman describes the ways in which recorded sound and digitally networked text each emerged as local anomalies that were yet deeply embedded within the reigning logic of public life and public memory. In the end Gitelman turns to the World Wide Web and asks how the history of the Web is already being told, how the Web might also resist history, and how using the Web might be producing the conditions of its own historicity. Publisher\u2019s page           Ambiguities of Witnessing: Law and Literature in the Time of a Truth Commission   By Mark Sanders   The first book to explore the complex relationship between law and literature in testimony to crimes of apartheid before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Ambiguities of Witnessing closely analyzes key individual testimonies. Whereas most existing books on this and other truth commissions are weighed down by abstract legal and philosophical discussion, this book does justice to witnesses\u2019 public testimony in a fascinating and theoretically sophisticated investigation of questions of human rights, mourning, forgiveness, and reparation. Framed by the personal, Ambiguities of Witnessing also meditates on what it means for the writer to respond to this epochal event in the history of post-apartheid South Africa.    Publisher\u2019s page           An Ethics of Betrayal: The Politics of Otherness in Emergent U.S. Literatures and Culture   By Crystal Parikh   In An Ethics of Betrayal, Crystal Parikh investigates the theme and tropes of betrayal and treason in Asian American and Chicano/Latino literary and cultural narratives. In considering betrayal from an ethical perspective, one grounded in the theories of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, Parikh argues that the minority subject is obligated in a primary, preontological, and irrecusable relation of responsibility to the Other. Episodes of betrayal and treason allegorize the position of this subject, beholden to the many others who embody the alterity of existence and whose demands upon the subject result in transgressions of intimacy and loyalty. In this first major comparative study of narratives by and about Asian Americans and Latinos, Parikh considers writings by Frank Chin, Gish Jen, Chang-rae Lee, Eric Liu, Am\u00e9rico Parades, and Richard Rodriguez, as well as narratives about the persecution of Wen Ho Lee and the rescue and return of Elian Gonz\u00e1lez. By addressing the conflicts at the heart of filiality, the public dimensions of language in the constitution of minority \"community,\" and the mercenary mobilizations of \"model minority\" status, An Ethics of Betrayal seriously engages the challenges of conducting ethnic and critical race studies based on the uncompromising and unromantic ideas of justice, reciprocity, and ethical society. Publisher\u2019s page            Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage   By Erin B. Mee (co-edited with Helene P. Foley)   Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage is the first book to analyse what happens to Sophocles' play as it is adapted and (re)produced around the world, and the first to focus specifically on Antigone in performance. The essays, by an international gathering of noted scholars from a wide range of disciplines, highlight the numerous ways in which social, political, historical, and cultural contexts transform the material, how artists and audiences in diverse societies including Argentina, The Congo, Finland, Haiti, India, Japan, and the United States interact with it, and the variety of issues it has been used to address.      Publisher's page                  Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry   By Maureen N. McLane   This is a new history and theory of British poetry between 1760 and 1830, focusing on the relationship between Romantic poetry and the production, circulation, and textuality of ballads. By discussing the ways in which eighteenth-century cultural and literary researches flowed into and shaped key canonical works, Maureen McLane argues that Romantic poetry\u2019s influences went far beyond the merely literary. Breathing new life into the work of eighteenth-century balladeers and antiquarians, she addresses the revival of the ballad, the figure of the minstrel, and the prevalence of a \u201cminstrelsy complex\u201d in Romanticism. Furthermore, she envisages a new way of engaging with Romantic poetics, encompassing both \u201coral\u201d and \u201cliterary\u201d modes of poetic construction, and anticipates the role that technology might play in a media-driven twenty-first century. The study will be of great interest to scholars and students of Romantic poetry, literature, and culture.  Publisher\u2019s page           Citizen Shakespeare: Freemen and Aliens in the Language of the Plays   By John Michael Archer   Shakespeare lived his professional life amid the London streets and died a prominent figure in the town of Stratford. The language of his plays is shot through with the concerns of London \"freemen\" and their wives, the diverse commercial class that nevertheless excluded adult immigrants from country towns and northern Europe alike. This book combines London historiography, close reading, and recent theories of citizen subjectivity to demonstrate for the first time that Shakespeare's plays embody citizen and alien identities despite their aristocratic settings. The book points out where the city shadows the country scenes of the major comedies, shows how London's trades animate the \"civil butchery\" of the history plays, and explains why England's metropolis becomes the fractured Rome of tragedy.    Publisher\u2019s page           Course in General Linguistics   By Perry Meisel (translated by Wade Baskin and co-edited with Haun Saussy)   The founder of modern linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure inaugurated semiology, structuralism, and deconstruction and made possible the work of Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, thus enabling the development of French feminism, gender studies, New Historicism, and postcolonialism. Based on Saussure\u2019s lectures, Course in General Linguistics (1916) traces the rise and fall of the historical linguistics in which Saussure was trained, the synchronic or structural linguistics with which he replaced it, and the new look of diachronic linguistics that followed this change. Most important, Saussure presents the principles of a new linguistic science that includes the invention of semiology, or the theory of the \u201csignifier,\u201d the \u201csignified,\u201d and the \u201csign\u201d that they combine to produce.     This is the first critical edition of Course in General Linguistics to appear in English and restores Wade Baskin\u2019s original translation of 1959, in which the terms \u201csignifier\u201d and \u201csignified\u201d are introduced into English in this precise way. Baskin renders Saussure clearly and accessibly, allowing readers to experience his shift of the theory of reference from mimesis to performance and his expansion of poetics to include all media, including the life sciences and environmentalism. An introduction situates Saussure within the history of ideas and describes the history of scholarship that made Course in General Linguistics legendary. New endnotes enlarge Saussure\u2019s contexts to include literary criticism, cultural studies, and philosophy.        Publisher\u2019s page           Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation   By John Guillory   John Guillory challenges the most fundamental premises of the canon   debate by resituating the problem of canon formation in an entirely new   theoretical framework. The result is a book that promises to recast not   only the debate about the literary curriculum but also the controversy   over \"multiculturalism\" and the current \"crisis of the humanities.\"   Employing concepts drawn from Pierre Bourdieu's sociology, Guillory   argues that canon formation must be understood less as a question of the   representation of social groups than as a question of the distribution   of \"cultural capital\" in the schools, which regulate access to literacy,   to the practices of reading and writing. Publisher's Page           Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire, and Modern British Literature   By Patrick Deer   Culture in Camouflage aims to remap the history of British war culture by insisting on the centrality and importance of the literature of the Second World War. The book offers the first comprehensive account of the emergence of modern war culture, arguing that its exceptional forms and temporalities force us to reappraise British cultural modernity. The book explores how writers like Ford Madox Ford, Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, T.E. Lawrence, Winston Churchill,Elizabeth Bowen, Virginia Woolf, James Hanley, Rex Warner, Alexander Baron, Keith Douglas, Henry Green, and Graham Greene contested the dominant narratives of war projected by an enormously powerful and persuasive mass media and culture industry. Patrick Deer reads war literature as one element in an expanded cultural field, which also includes popular culture and mass communications, the productions of war planners and military historians, projections of new technologies of violence, the fantasies and theories of strategists, and the material culture of total war. Modern war cultures, Deer contends, are defined by their drive to normalize conflict and war-making, by their struggle to colonize the entire wartime cultural field, and by their claim to monopolize representations and interpretation of the conflict. But the mobilization of cultural formations during wartime reveals, at times glaringly, the constitutive contradictions at the heart of modern ideas of culture. The Great War failed to produce a popular war culture on the home front, producing instead an extraordinary literature of protest, yet the strategists struggled to regain their oversight over both the enemy across no man's land, and the minds and bodies of their own mass conscript armies. The interwar years saw a massive effort to make strategic fantasies a reality; if the technology of imperial air power or mobile armoured warfare did not yet exist, culture could be mobilized to shore up the ramshackle war machine. During World War Two a fully fledged British war culture emerged triumphant in time of national crisis, offering the vision of a fully mobilized island fortress, a loyal empire, and a modernized war machine ready to wage a futuristic war of space and movement. This was the struggle that British World War Two writers confronted with extraordinary courage and creativity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Digital Literary Studies: Corpus Approaches to Poetry, Prose, and Drama   By David L. Hoover, Jonathan Culpeper, and Kieran O'Halloran   Digital Literary Studies presents a broad and varied picture of the promise and potential of methods and approaches that are crucially dependent upon the digital nature of the literary texts it studies and the texts and collections of texts with which they are compared. It focuses on style, diction, characterization, and interpretation of single works and across larger groups of texts, using both huge natural language corpora and smaller, more specialized collections of texts created for specific tasks, and applies statistical techniques used in the narrower confines of authorship attribution to broader stylistic questions. It addresses important issues in each of the three major literary genres, and intentionally applies different techniques and concepts to poetry, prose, and drama. It aims to present a provocative and suggestive sample intended to encourage the application of these and other methods to literary studies.     Hoover, Culpeper, and O\u2019Halloran push the methods, techniques, and concepts in new directions, apply them to new groups of texts or to new questions, modify their nature or method of application, and combine them in innovative ways.      Publisher's page           Elinor James   By Paula McDowell   This volume makes available for the first time the complete surviving works of the London printer-author Elinor James (c.1645-1719). Uniquely in the history of early modern women, James wrote, printed and distributed more than ninety pamphlets and broadsides addressing political, religious and commercial concerns. Written over a period of 35 years, her works provide us with a running commentary on the major national events of a tumultuous period such as the Revolution of 1688, the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, and the Jacobite uprisings in 1715-16. During her lifetime, England saw the succession of six different monarchs. James petitioned all of them and claimed to have obtained audiences with three. In 1689 she was gaoled in Newgate prison, accused of disseminating seditious material condemning William III for accepting the English crown.    James's texts address a staggeringly broad range of concerns. She petitioned Parliament concerning legislation affecting the printing trades and petitioned fellow printers concerning labour relations in London printing houses. She petitioned City authorities on issues such as the enforcement of bylaws or who to vote for in City and parliamentary elections. It is hoped that by making available all of James's known works, this volume will inspire the collective efforts of scholars from many different disciplines to decipher her references to contemporary events, issues and persons, as well as prompting further discoveries of as yet unidentified works.    Publisher\u2019s page              Epic Traditions in the Contemporary World: The Poetics of Community   By Susanne Wofford (co-edited with Margaret Beissinger and Jane Tylus)   The epic tradition has been part of many different cultures throughout human history. This noteworthy collection of essays provides a comparative reassessment of epic and its role in the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds, as it explores the variety of contemporary approaches to the epic genre. Employing theoretical perspectives drawn from anthropology, literary studies, and gender studies, the authors examine familiar and less well known oral and literary traditions\u2014ancient Greek and Latin, Arabic, South Slavic, Indian, Native American, Italian, English, and Caribbean\u2014demonstrating the continuing vitality of the epic tradition.    Juxtaposing work on the traditional canon of western epics with scholarship on contemporary epics from various parts of the world, these essays cross the divide between oral and literary forms that has long marked the approach to the genre. With its focus on the links among narrative, politics, and performance, the collection creates a new dialogue illustrating the sociopolitical significance of the epic tradition. Taken together, the essays raise compelling new issues for the study of epic, as they examine concerns such as national identity, gender, pedagogy, and the creation of the canon.    Publisher\u2019s page           Feeling Beauty: The Neuroscience of Aesthetic Experience   By G. Gabrielle Starr                         In Feeling Beauty, G. Gabrielle Starr   argues that understanding the neural underpinnings of aesthetic   experience can reshape our conceptions of aesthetics and the arts.   Drawing on the tools of both cognitive neuroscience and traditional   humanist inquiry, Starr shows that neuroaesthetics offers a new model   for understanding the dynamic and changing features of aesthetic life,   the relationships among the arts, and how individual differences in   aesthetic judgment shape the varieties of aesthetic experience.     Starr, a scholar of the humanities and a researcher in the   neuroscience of aesthetics, proposes that aesthetic experience relies on   a distributed neural architecture\u2014a set of brain areas involved in   emotion, perception, imagery, memory, and language. More important, it   emerges from networked interactions, intricately connected and   coordinated brain systems that together form a flexible architecture   enabling us to develop new arts and to see the world around us   differently. Focusing on the \u201csister arts\u201d of poetry, painting, and   music, Starr builds and tests a neural model of aesthetic experience   valid across all the arts. Asking why works that address different   senses using different means seem to produce the same set of feelings,   she examines particular works of art in a range of media, including a   poem by Keats, a painting by van Gogh, a sculpture by Bernini, and   Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations. Starr\u2019s innovative, interdisciplinary   analysis is true to the complexities of both the physical instantiation   of aesthetics and the realities of artistic representation. Publisher's Page                        Fieldworks: From Place to Site in Postwar Poetics   By Lytle Shaw   Fieldworks offers a historical account of the social, rhetorical, and material attempts to ground art and poetry in the physicality of a site. Arguing that place-oriented inquiries allowed poets and artists to develop new, experimental models of historiography and ethnography, Lytle Shaw draws out the shifting terms of this practice from World War II to the present through a series of illuminating case studies. Beginning with the alternate national genealogies unearthed by William Carlos Williams in Paterson and Charles Olson in Gloucester, Shaw demonstrates how subsequent poets sought to ground such inquiries in concrete social formations\u2014to in effect live the poetics of place: Gary Snyder in his back-to-the-land familial compound, Kitkitdizze; Amiri Baraka in a black nationalist community in Newark; Robert Creeley and the poets of Bolinas, California, in the capacious \u201cnow\u201d of their poet-run town. Turning to the work of Robert Smithson\u2014who called one of his essays an \u201cappendix to Paterson,\u201d and who in turn has exerted a major influence on poets since the 1970s\u2014Shaw then traces the emergence of site-specific art in relation both to the poetics of place and to the larger linguistic turn in the humanities, considering poets including Clark Coolidge, Bernadette Mayer, and Lisa Robertson. By putting the poetics of place into dialog with site-specificity in art, Shaw demonstrates how poets and artists became experimental explicators not just of concrete locations and their histories, but of the discourses used to interpret sites more broadly. It is this dual sense of fieldwork that organizes Shaw\u2019s groundbreaking history of site-specific poetry. Publisher's Page           Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies   By Elizabeth McHenry   Over the past decade the popularity of black writers including E. Lynn Harris and Terry McMillan has been hailed as an indication that an active African American reading public has come into being. Yet this is not a new trend; there is a vibrant history of African American literacy, literary associations, and book clubs. Forgotten Readers reveals that neglected past, looking at the reading practices of free blacks in the antebellum north and among African Americans following the Civil War. It places the black upper and middle classes within American literary history, illustrating how they used reading and literary conversation as a means to assert their civic identities and intervene in the political and literary cultures of the United States from which they were otherwise excluded. Forgotten Readers expands our definition of literacy and urges us to think of literature as broadly as it was conceived of in the nineteenth century. Elizabeth McHenry delves into archival sources, including the records of past literary societies and the unpublished writings of their members. She examines particular literary associations, including the Saturday Nighters of Washington, D.C., whose members included Jean Toomer and Georgia Douglas Johnson. She shows how black literary societies developed, their relationship to the black press, and the ways that African American women\u2019s clubs\u2014which flourished during the 1890s\u2014encouraged literary activity. In an epilogue, McHenry connects this rich tradition of African American interest in books, reading, and literary conversation to contemporary literary phenomena such as Oprah Winfrey\u2019s book club. Forgotten Readers redirects contemporary thinking about the origins of African American literature and adds a vital element to scholarship on the history of the book. Publisher\u2019s page           Frank O&rsquo;Hara: The Poetics of Coterie   By Lytle Shaw   O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems are famously filled with proper names\u2014from those of his immediate friends and colleagues in the New York writing and art worlds (John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Grace Hartigan, Willem de Kooning, and many musicians, dancers, and filmmakers) to a broad range of popular cultural and literary heroes (Apollinaire to Jackie O). But rather than understand O\u2019Hara\u2019s most commonly referenced names as a fixed and insular audience, Shaw argues that he uses the ambiguities of reference associated with the names to invent a fluid and shifting kinship structure\u2014one that opened up radical possibilities for a gay writer operating outside the structure of the family.    As Shaw demonstrates, this commitment to an experimental model of association also guides O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing. Like his poetry, O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing too has been condemned as insular, coterie writing. In fact, though, he was alone among 1950s critics in his willingness to consider abstract expressionism not only within the dominant languages of existentialism and formalism but also within the cold war political and popular cultural frameworks that anticipate many of the concerns of contemporary art historians. Situating O\u2019Hara within a range of debates about art\u2019s possible relations to its audience, Shaw demonstrates that his interest in coterie is less a symptomatic offshoot of his biography than a radical literary and artistic invention.    Publisher\u2019s page           From Philology to English Studies: Language and Culture in the Nineteenth Century   By Haruko Momma   The study of English language and literature in Britain changed dramatically between the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. From Philology to English Studies explores the contribution of philology to this evolution. Haruko Momma charts both the rise and fall of philology from antiquity to the late eighteenth century, and the impact of modern philology on the study of modern languages and literatures. Focusing in detail on the work of key philologists in the nineteenth century, Momma considers how they shaped European discourse and especially vernacular studies in Britain: William Jones' discovery of Sanskrit in British India gave rise to Indo-European studies; Max M\u00fcller's study of this same language helped spread the Aryan myth to the English-speaking world; the OED achieved its greatness as a post-national lexicon through the editorship of the Scottish dialectologist. Publisher's Page           Genres of the Credit Economy: Mediating Value in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain   By Mary Poovey   How did banking, borrowing, investing, and even losing money\u2014in other words, participating in the modern financial system\u2014come to seem like routine activities of everyday life? Genres of the Credit Economy addresses this question by examining the history of financial instruments and representations of finance in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. Chronicling the process by which some of our most important conceptual categories were naturalized, Mary Poovey explores complex relationships among forms of writing that are not usually viewed together, from bills of exchange and bank checks, to realist novels and Romantic poems, to economic theory and financial journalism. Taking up all early forms of financial and monetary writing, Poovey argues that these genres mediated for early modern Britons the operations of a market system organized around credit and debt. By arguing that genre is a critical tool for historical and theoretical analysis and an agent in the events that formed the modern world, Poovey offers a new way to appreciate the character of the credit economy and demonstrates the contribution historians and literary scholars can make to understanding its operations. Much more than an exploration of writing on and around money, Genres of the Credit Economy offers startling insights about the evolution of disciplines and the separation of factual and fictional genres.    Publisher\u2019s page           Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England   By Juliet Fleming   Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England is an   excavation of a series of previously unknown or disregarded writing   practices. Our modern assumptions regarding written expression have   limited our examination of the history of writing and literacy to that   which has been preserved in print or manuscript. In a work of tremendous   originality and intellectual daring, Fleming brings detailed historical   scholarship into dialogue with the challenge of contemporary theory to   explore a lost realm where writing practices moved off the boundaries of   the page to fill windows, body surfaces, ceramics, ceilings, and walls. Developing   and drawing on an archive that has until now been closed to literary   scholars, Fleming argues that the whitewashed wall was the primary   writing apparatus of the early modern English, recovers the tattoo   practices of sixteenth-century Europeans, and demonstrates how to read   the poetic burden of early modern crockery. Her book is a work of   cultural history that provides a startling new perspective on early   modern writing, one that swerves from the preoccupations of generations   of scholars in order to transform the fundamental terms of literary   inquiry.

Publisher\u2019s page           Heart Beats: Everyday Life and the Memorized Poem   By Catherine Robson   Many people in Great Britain and the United States can recall elderly relatives who remembered long stretches of verse learned at school decades earlier, yet most of us were never required to recite in class. Heart Beats is the first book to examine how poetry recitation came to assume a central place in past curricular programs, and to investigate when and why the once-mandatory exercise declined. Telling the story of a lost pedagogical practice and its wide-ranging effects on two sides of the Atlantic, Catherine Robson explores how recitation altered the ordinary people who committed poems to heart, and changed the worlds in which they lived. Heart Beats begins by investigating recitation's progress within British and American public educational systems over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and weighs the factors that influenced which poems were most frequently assigned. Robson then scrutinizes the recitational fortunes of three short works that were once classroom classics: Felicia Hemans's \"Casabianca,\" Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,\" and Charles Wolfe's \"Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna.\" To conclude, the book considers W. E. Henley's \"Invictus\" and Rudyard Kipling's \"If--,\" asking why the idea of the memorized poem arouses such different responses in the United States and Great Britain today. Focusing on vital connections between poems, individuals, and their communities, Heart Beats is an important study of the history and power of memorized poetry.

Josephine Hendin looks at this   figure and argues that a violent woman is a grenade pitched toward both   conservative and liberal views of women.                                 Publisher's Page           How Soon is Now? Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and The Queerness of Time   By Carolyn Dinshaw   How Soon Is Now? performs a powerful critique of modernist temporal regimes through its revelatory exploration of queer ways of being in time as well as of the potential queerness of time itself. Carolyn Dinshaw focuses on medieval tales of asynchrony and on engagements with these medieval temporal worlds by amateur readers centuries later. In doing so, she illuminates forms of desirous, embodied being that are out of sync with ordinarily linear measurements of everyday life, that involve multiple temporalities, that precipitate out of time altogether. Dinshaw claims the possibility of a fuller, denser, more crowded now that theorists tell us is extant but that often eludes our temporal grasp. Whether discussing Victorian men of letters who parodied the Book of John Mandeville, a fictionalized fourteenth-century travel narrative, or Hope Emily Allen, modern coeditor of the early-fifteenth-century Book of Margery Kempe, Dinshaw argues that these and other medievalists outside the academy inhabit different temporalities than modern professionals operating according to the clock. How Soon Is Now? clears space for amateurs, hobbyists, and dabblers who approach medieval worlds from positions of affect and attachment, from desires to build other kinds of worlds. Unruly, untimely, they urge us toward a disorderly and asynchronous collective Publisher's page           Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix   By Martha Rust   This book envisions the confines of medieval manuscripts as the potential territory of many virtual worlds: realms that readers call forth through their imaginative interactions with a book\u2019s material features. Each component of a medieval manuscript--its alphabetical characters, pages, images, text, gloss--offers an avenue of involvement with the world of books, and with the worldsin books. The explorations presented here follow those paths in a selection of manuscripts and texts produced in late-medieval Britain, tracing the fortunes of characters who become subject to and sometimes subjects in the very books the read and write.    Publisher\u2019s page           In Visible Movement   By Tom&aacute;s Urayo&aacute;n Noel   The first book-length study specifically devoted to Nuyorican poetry, In Visible Movement    is unique in its historical and formal breadth, ranging from the   foundational poets of the 1960s and 1970s to a variety of contemporary   poets emerging in and around the Nuyorican Poets Cafe \u201cslam\u201d scene of   the 1990s and early 2000s. It also unearths a largely unknown corpus of   poetry performances, reading over forty years of Nuyorican poetry at the   intersection of the printed and performed word, underscoring the   poetry\u2019s links to vernacular and Afro-Puerto Rican performance cultures,   from the island\u2019s oral poets to the New York sounds and rhythms of   Latin boogaloo, salsa, and hip-hop. With depth and insight, Urayo\u00e1n Noel   analyzes various canonical Nuyorican poems by poets such as Pedro   Pietri, Victor Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, Miguel Algar\u00edn, Miguel Pi\u00f1ero, Sandra   Mar\u00eda Esteves, and Tato Laviera. He discusses historically overlooked   poets such as Lorraine Sutton, innovative poets typically read outside   the Nuyorican tradition such as Frank Lima and Edwin Torres, and a   younger generation of Nuyorican-identified poets including Willie   Perdomo, Mar\u00eda Teresa Mariposa Fern\u00e1ndez, and Emanuel Xavier, whose work   has received only limited critical consideration. The result is a   stunning reflection of how New York Puerto Rican poets have addressed   the complexity of identity amid diaspora for over forty years.           Land/Scape/Theater   By Una Chaudhuri (Co-edited with Elinor Fuchs)   Land/Scape/Theater proposes landscape as a necessary paradigm for understanding modern theater's increasingly spatialized aesthetic as well as its engagement with the cultural meanings of place and space.    Embracing subjects as diverse as the \"landscape dramaturgy\" of Suzan-Lori Parks, Artaud's trip to the Sierra Madre,Gertrude Stein's landscape theory and practice, Guillermo Gomez-Pe\u00f1a's \"border subjects,\" and Bayreuth and Disneyland as cultic sites, Land/Scape/Theater draws on a broad range of theory, dramatic texts, and performance. All aspects of modern theater, these essays suggest, including the bedrock Aristotelian constituents of plot and character, have a landscape dimension that often goes unrecognized.    With its broad theoretical range and cross-disciplinary reach, Land/Scape/Theater will interest theater theorists and practitioners and cultural studies specialists, including historians of landscape. Theater students, scholars, teachers, directors, designers, and actors will find here a new framework and a new vocabulary for understanding both theater and the larger culture.    Publisher\u2019s page           London Calling: How Black and Asian Writers Imagined a City   By Sukhdev Sandhu   From the 11th century, when one commentator claimed the capital was being over-run with Moors, to the garage MCs and street poets of today \u2013 this book tells the story of life in London for black and Asian people from the seventeenth century until today. London Calling tells the story of black and Asian literary London, tracing the escapades, fortune making, and self-expansion of these forgotten writers. It is a joyful and often rapturous work, a love letter to the capital, a teeming and complex mix of social and cultural history seen through the imagination and experience of great black and Asian writers. London Calling gets to the heart of the immigration impulse, and evokes the dreams and adventures of those who have sought refuge and asylum in the cradle of Empire. The book is populated by runaway slaves, lotharios, imams, boxer-pimps, rajahs and colonial revolutionaries, and discusses writers as diverse in style and time as the 18th-century grocer-aesthete Ignatius Sancho right through to Rushdie, Kureishi and yardie chronicler Victor Headley. The result is an exciting work, brimming with life, as it spotlights a rich but neglected literary tradition, and brings to life a gaping void in the city's history. Placing the multiculturalism of today's capital in its historical context, Sukhdev Sandhu shows that it is no new phenomenon, and that just as London has been the making of many black writers, they too have been the making of London.    Publisher's page           Lyric Generations: Poetry and the Novel in the Long Eighteenth Century   By Gabrielle Starr   Eighteenth\u2014century British literary history is traditionally characterized by two central and seemingly discrete movements: the rise of the novel and the development of Romantic lyric poetry. In fact, recent scholarship reveals that these genres are inextricably bound: constructions of interiority developed in novels changed ideas about what literature could mean and do, encouraging the new focus on private experience and self\u2014perception developed in lyric poetry.    In Lyric Generations Gabrielle Starr rejects the usual genealogy of lyric poetry in which Romantic poets are thought to have built solely and directly upon the works of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton. She argues instead that novelists such as Richardson, Haywood, Behn and others, while drawing upon earlier lyric conventions, ushered in a new language of self\u2014expression and community that profoundly affected the aesthetic goals of lyric poets. Examining the works of Cowper, Smith, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats in light of their competitive dialogue with the novel, Starr advances a literary history that considers formal characteristics as products of historical change. In a world increasingly defined by prose, poets adapted the new forms, characters, and moral themes of the novel in order to reinvigorate poetic practice. Publisher\u2019s page           Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentleman   By Catherine Robson   Fascination with little girls pervaded Victorian culture. For many, girls represented the true essence of childhood or bygone times of innocence; but for middle-class men, especially writers, the interest ran much deeper. In Men in Wonderland, Catherine Robson explores the ways in which various nineteenth-century British male authors constructed girlhood, and analyzes the nature of their investment in the figure of the girl. In so doing, she reveals the link between the idealization of little girls and a widespread fantasy of male development--a myth suggesting that men become masculine only after an initial feminine stage, lived out in the protective environment of the nursery. Little girls, argues Robson, thus offer an adult male the best opportunity to reconnect with his own lost self.    Tracing the beginnings of this myth in the writings of Romantics Wordsworth and De Quincey, Robson identifies the consolidation of this paradigm in numerous Victorian artifacts, ranging from literary works by Dickens and Barrett Browning, to paintings by Frith and Millais, to reports of the Royal Commission on Children's Employment. She analyzes Ruskin and Carroll's \"high noon\" of girl worship and investigates the destruction of the fantasy in the closing decades of the century, when social concerns about the working girl sexualized the image of young females.    Men in Wonderland contributes to a growing interest in the nineteenth century's construction of childhood, sexuality, and masculinity, and illuminates their complex interconnections with a startlingly different light. Not only does it complicate the narratives of pedophilic desire that are generally used to explain figures like Ruskin and Carroll, but it offers a new understanding of the Victorian era's obsession with loss, its rampant sentimentality, and its intense valorization of the little girl at the expense of mature femininity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Middle English Literature: A Cultural History   By Christopher Cannon   Polity, 2008. This book provides a boldly original account of Middle English literature from the Norman Conquest to the beginning of the sixteenth century. It argues that these centuries are, in fundamental ways, the momentous period in our literary history, for they are the long moment in which the category of literature itself emerged as English writing began to insist, for the first time, that it floated free of any social reality or function. This book also charts the complex mechanisms by which English writing acquired this power in a series of linked close readings of both canonical and more obscure texts. It encloses those readings in five compelling accounts of much broader cultural areas, describing, in particular, the productive relationship of Middle English writing to medieval technology, insurgency, statecraft and cultural place, concluding with an in depth account of the particular arguments, emphases and techniques English writers used to claim a wholly new jurisdiction for their work. Both this history and its readings are everywhere informed by the most exciting developments in recent Middle English scholarship as well as literary and cultural theory. It serves as an introduction to all these areas as well as a contribution, in its own right, to each of them. Publisher\u2019s page           Modernisms: A Literary Guide   By Peter Nicholls   University of California, 2009. The recent enthusiasm for things postmodern has often produced a caricature of Modernism as monolithic and reactionary. Peter Nicholls argues instead that the distinctive feature of Modernism is its diversity. Through a lively analysis of each of Modernism's main literary movements, he explores the connections between the new stylistic developments and the shifting politics of gender and authority.\u2028\u2028Nicholls introduces a wealth of literary experimentation, beginning with Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9 and moving forward to the first avant-gardes. Close readings of key texts monitor the explosive histories of Futurism, Expressionism, Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism, histories that allow Anglo-American Modernism to be seen in a strikingly different light. In revealing Modernism's broad and varied terrain, Nicholls evokes the richness of a cultural moment that continues to shape our own. Publisher\u2019s page           My Poets   By Maureen N. McLane   \u201cOh! there are spirits of the air,\u201d wrote Percy Bysshe Shelley. In this stunningly original book, Maureen N. McLane channels the spirits and voices that make up the music in one poet\u2019s mind. Weaving criticism and memoir, My Poets explores a life reading and a life read. McLane invokes not necessarily the best poets, nor the most important poets (whoever these might be), but those writers who, in possessing her, made her. \u201cI am marking here what most marked me,\u201d she writes. Ranging from Chaucer to H.D. to William Carlos Williams to Louise Gl\u00fcck to Shelley (among others), McLane tracks the \u201cgrowth of a poet\u2019s mind,\u201d as Wordsworth put it in The Prelude. In poetical prose both probing and incantatory, McLane has written a radical book of experimental criticism. Susan Sontag called for an \u201cerotics of interpretation\u201d: this is it. Part Bildung, part dithyramb, part exegesis, My Poets extends an implicit invitation to you, dear reader, to consider who your \u201cmy poets,\u201d or \u201cmy novelists,\u201d or \u201cmy filmmakers,\u201d or \u201cmy pop stars,\u201d might be. Publisher's Page           Negative Liberties: Morrison, Pynchon, and the Problem of Liberal Ideology   By Cyrus R. K. Patell   Since the nineteenth century, ideas centered on the individual, on Emersonian self-reliance, and on the right of the individual to the pursuit of happiness have had a tremendous presence in the United States\u2014and even more so after the Reagan era. But has this presence been for the good of all? In Negative Liberties Cyrus R. K. Patell revises important ideas in the debate about individualism and the political theory of liberalism. He does so by adding two new voices to the current discussion\u2014Toni Morrison and Thomas Pynchon\u2014to examine the different ways in which their writings embody, engage, and critique the official narrative generated by U.S. liberal ideology.    Pynchon and Morrison reveal the official narrative of individualism as encompassing a complex structure of contradiction held in abeyance. This narrative imagines that the goals of the individual are not at odds with the goals of the family or society and in fact obscures the existence of an unholy truce between individual liberty and forms of oppression. By bringing these two fiction writers into a discourse dominated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Isaiah Berlin, John Rawls, George Kateb, Robert Bellah, and Michael Sandel, Patell unmasks the ways in which contemporary U.S. culture has not fully shed the oppressive patterns of reasoning handed down by the slaveholding culture from which American individualism emerged. With its interdisciplinary approach, Negative Liberties will appeal to students and scholars of American literature, culture, sociology, and politics.    Publisher\u2019s page           Nineteenth-Century Lives   By Laurence S. Lockridge   In Nineteenth-Century Lives ten distinguished critics and biographers consider what it means to narrate a life. Their illustrative texts are largely taken from nineteenth-century biography, autobiography and the novel, but narrative is the broader genre that unites their various inquiries. The principal issues, theoretical and practical, are framed by Margaret Atwood, J. Hillis Miller and Phyllis Rose. 'The biographer, like the novelist, is a constructor of narratives; it's just that the ground rules are a little different,' writes Atwood. Among the matters they debate are the boundaries of fact and fiction, the professed power of the narrator, and the figurative underpinings of autobiography. But many of these essays are delightful and provocative biographical and autobiographical excursions in themselves. Atwood describes her early fear of biography, Morton Cohen narrates an exciting bit of detective work into the life of Lewis Carroll, and John Rosenberg gives a vivid and frequently revisionary reading of many aspects of Darwin's life. Other critics - Carl Woodring, Richard Altick, Norman Kelvin, Margaret Stetz, and Robert Kiely - consider related topics: the autobiographical poem as Bildungsroman, the nineteenth-century art biography, the relationship of William Morris's life to the structural principles of his art, the guilt-ridden fiction of the 1890s, and a seemingly marginal character in fiction, the 'nobody'.    Publisher\u2019s page           On Eloquence   By Denis Donoghue   On Eloquence questions the common assumption that eloquence is merely a subset of rhetoric, a means toward a rhetorical end. Denis Donoghue, an eminent and prolific critic of the English language, holds that this assumption is erroneous. While rhetoric is the use of language to persuade people to do one thing rather than another, Donoghue maintains that eloquence is \u201cgratuitous, ideally autonomous, in speech and writing an upsurge of creative vitality for its own sake.\u201d He offers many instances of eloquence in words, and suggests the forms our appreciation of them should take.    Donoghue argues persuasively that eloquence matters, that we should indeed care about it. \u201cBecause we should care about any instances of freedom, independence, creative force, sprezzatura,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially when we live\u2014perhaps this is increasingly the case\u2014in a culture of the same, featuring official attitudes, stereotypes of the officially enforced values, sedated language, a politics of pacification.\u201d A noteworthy addition to Donoghue\u2019s long-term project to reclaim a disinterested appreciation of literature as literature, this volume is a wise and pleasurable meditation on eloquence, its unique ability to move or give pleasure, and its intrinsic value. Publisher\u2019s page           Plague Writing in Early Modern England   By Ernest B. Gilman   University of Chicago, 2009. During the seventeenth century, England was beset by three epidemics of the bubonic plague, each outbreak claiming between a quarter and a third of the population of London and other urban centers. Surveying a wide range of responses to these epidemics\u2014sermons, medical tracts, pious exhortations, satirical pamphlets, and political commentary\u2014Plague Writing in Early Modern England brings to life the many and complex ways Londoners made sense of such unspeakable devastation. Ernest B. Gilman argues that the plague writing of the period attempted unsuccessfully to rationalize the catastrophic and that its failure to account for the plague as an instrument of divine justice fundamentally threatened the core of Christian belief. Gilman also trains his critical eye on the works of Jonson, Donne, Pepys, and Defoe, which, he posits, can be more fully understood when put into the context of this century-long project to \u201cwrite out\u201d the plague. Ultimately, Plague Writing in Early Modern England is more than a compendium of artifacts of a bygone era; it holds up a distant mirror to reflect our own condition in the age of AIDS, super viruses, multidrug resistant tuberculosis, and the hovering threat of a global flu pandemic. Publisher's page           Private Affairs: Critical Ventures in the Culture of Social Relations   By Phillip Brian Harper   In Private Affairs, Phillip Brian Harper explores the social and cultural significance of the private, proposing that, far from a universal right, privacy is limited by one's racial-and sexual-minority status. Ranging across cinema, literature, sculpture, and lived encounters-from Rodin's The Kiss to Jenny Livingston's Paris is Burning-Private Affairs demonstrates how the very concept of privacy creates personal and sociopolitical hierarchies in contemporary America. Publisher\u2019s page           Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Making of American Literature   By Bryan Waterman   In the 1790s, a single conversational circle -- the Friendly Club -- united New York City's most ambitious young writers, and in Republic of Intellect, Bryan Waterman uses an innovative blend of literary criticism and historical narrative to re\u2014create the club's intellectual culture. The story of the Friendly Club reveals the mutually informing conditions of authorship, literary association, print culture, and production of knowledge in a specific time and place -- the tumultuous, tenuous world of post\u2014revolutionary New York City. More than any similar group in the early American republic, the Friendly Club occupied a crossroads -- geographical, professional, and otherwise -- of American literary and intellectual culture.    Waterman argues that the relationships among club members' novels, plays, poetry, diaries, legal writing, and medical essays lead to important first examples of a distinctively American literature and also illuminate the local, national, and transatlantic circuits of influence and information that club members called \"the republic of intellect.\" He addresses topics ranging from political conspiracy in the gothic novels of Charles Brockden Brown to the opening of William Dunlap's Park Theatre, from early American debates on gendered conversation to the publication of the first American medical journal. Voluntary association and print culture helped these young New Yorkers, Waterman concludes, to produce a broader and more diverse post\u2014revolutionary public sphere than scholars have yet recognized. Publisher\u2019s page           Securing the Commonwealth: Debt, Speculation, and Writing in the Making of Early America   By Jennifer J. Baker   Securing the Commonwealth examines how eighteenth\u2014century American writers understood the highly speculative financial times in which they lived. Spanning a century of cultural and literary life, this study shows how the era's literature commonly depicted an American ethos of risk taking and borrowing as the peculiar product of New World daring and the exigencies of revolution and nation building.    Some of the century's most important writers, including Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin, Royall Tyler, Charles Brockden Brown, and Judith Sargent Murray, believed that economic and social commonwealth -- and one's commitment to that commonwealth -- might be grounded in indebtedness and financial insecurity. These writers believed a cash\u2014poor colony or nation could not only advance itself through borrowing but also gain reputability each time it successfully paid off a loan. Equally important, they believed that debt could promote communality: precarious public credit structures could exact popular commitment; intricate financial networks could bind individuals to others and to their government; and indebtedness itself could evoke sympathy for the suffering of others.    Close readings of their literary works reveal how these writers imagined that public life might be shaped by economic experience, and how they understood the public life of literature itself. Insecure times strengthened their conviction that writing could be publicly serviceable, persuading readers to invest in their government, in their fellow Americans, and in the idea of America itself.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing   By Carolyn Dinshaw (Co-edited with David Wallace)   The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing seeks to recover the lives and particular experiences of medieval women by concentrating on various kinds of texts: the texts they wrote themselves as well as texts that attempted to shape, limit, or expand their lives. The first section investigates the roles traditionally assigned to medieval women (as virgins, widows, and wives); it also considers female childhood and relations between women. The second section explores social spaces, including textuality itself: for every surviving medieval manuscript bespeaks collaborative effort. It considers women as authors, as anchoresses 'dead to the world', and as preachers and teachers in the world staking claims to authority without entering a pulpit. The final section considers the lives and writings of remarkable women, including Marie de France, Heloise, Joan of Arc, Julian of Norwich, Margery Kempe, and female lyricists and romancers whose names are lost, but whose texts survive.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in Nineteenth-Century America   By Thomas Augst   Thousands of men left their families for the bustling cities of nineteenth-century America, where many of them found work as clerks. The Clerk's Tale recounts their remarkable story, describing the struggle of aspiring businessmen to come of age at the dawn of the modern era. How did these young men understand the volatile world of American capitalism and make sense of their place within it?    Thomas Augst follows clerks as they made their way through the boarding houses, parlors, and offices of the big city. Tracing the course of their everyday lives, Augst shows how these young men used acts of reading and writing to navigate the anonymous world of market culture and claim identities for themselves within it. Clerks, he reveals, calculated their prospects in diaries, composed detailed letters to friends and family, attended lectures by key thinkers of the day, joined libraries where they consumed fiction, all while wrestling with the boredom of their work. What results, then, is a poignant look at the literary practices of ordinary people and an affecting meditation on the moral lives of men in antebellum America.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Idea of English Ethnicity   By Robert J.C. Young   In this major contribution to debates about English identity, leading theorist Robert J.C. Young argues that Englishness was never really about England at all. In the nineteenth century, it was rather developed as a form of long-distance identity for the English diaspora around the world. Young shows how the effects of this continue to reverberate today, nationally and globally. Publisher\u2019s page           The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel   By Elaine Freedgood   While the Victorian novel famously describes, catalogs, and inundates the reader with things, the protocols for reading it have long enjoined readers not to interpret most of what crowds its pages. The Ideas in Things explores apparently inconsequential objects in popular Victorian texts to make contact with their fugitive meanings. Developing an innovative approach to analyzing nineteenth-century fiction, Elaine Freedgood here reconnects the things readers unwittingly ignore to the stories they tell.    Building her case around objects from three well-known Victorian novels\u2014the mahogany furniture in Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre, the calico curtains in Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s Mary Barton, and \u201cNegro head\u201d tobacco in Charles Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations\u2014Freedgood argues that these things are connected to histories that the novels barely acknowledge, generating darker meanings outside the novels\u2019 symbolic systems. A valuable contribution to the new field of object studies in the humanities, The Ideas in Things pushes readers\u2019 thinking about things beyond established concepts of commodity and fetish. Publisher\u2019s page           The New Asian City: Three-Dimensional Fictions of Space and Urban Form   By Jini Kim Watson     Under Jini Kim Watson\u2019s scrutiny, the Asian Tiger metropolises of Seoul,   Taipei, and Singapore reveal a surprising residue of the colonial   environment. Drawing on a wide array of literary, filmic, and political   works, and juxtaposing close readings of the built environment, Watson   demonstrates how processes of migration and construction in the   hypergrowth urbanscapes of the Pacific Rim crystallize the psychic and   political dramas of their colonized past and globalized present.   Tracing the way newly constructed spaces\u2014including expressways,   high-rises, factory zones, and department stores\u2014become figured within   cultural texts, The New Asian City explores how urban   transformations were rationalized, perceived, and fictionalized. Watson   shows how literature, film, and poetry have described and challenged   contemporary Asian metropolises, especially around the formation of   gendered and laboring subjects in these new spaces. She suggests that by   embracing the postwar growth-at-any-cost imperative, they have   buttressed the nationalist enterprise along neocolonial lines.       The New Asian City provides an innovative approach to how we   might better understand the gleaming metropolises of the Pacific Rim. In   doing so, it demonstrates how reading cultural production in   conjunction with built environments can enrich our knowledge of the   lived consequences of rapid economic and urban development. Publisher's page           The Scandal of the State: Women, Law, and Citizenship in Postcolonial India   By Rajeswari Sunder Rajan   The Scandal of the State is a revealing study of the relationship between the postcolonial, democratic Indian nation-state and Indian women\u2019s actual needs and lives. Well-known for her work combining feminist theory and postcolonial studies, Rajeswari Sunder Rajan shows how the state is central to understanding women\u2019s identities and how, reciprocally, women and \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d affect the state\u2019s role and function. She argues that in India law and citizenship define for women not only the scope of political rights but also cultural identity and everyday life. Sunder Rajan delineates the postcolonial state in implicit contrast with the \u201cenlightened,\u201d postfeminist neoliberal state in the West. Her analysis wrestles with complex social realities, taking into account the influence of age, ethnicity, religion, and class on individual and group identities as well as the shifting, heterogeneous nature of the state itself. The Scandal of the State develops through a series of compelling case studies, each of which centers around an incident exposing the contradictory position of the Indian state vis-\u00e0-vis its female citizens and, ultimately, the inadequacy of its commitment to women\u2019s rights. Sunder Rajan focuses on the custody battle over a Muslim child bride, the compulsory sterilization of mentally retarded women in state institutional care, female infanticide in Tamilnadu, prostitution as labor rather than crime, and the surrender of the female outlaw Phoolan Devi. She also looks at the ways the Uniform Civil Code presented many women with a stark choice between allegiance to their religion and community or the secular assertion of individual rights. Rich with theoretical acumen and activist passion, The Scandal of the State is a powerful critique of the mutual dependence of women and the state on one another in the specific context of a postcolonial modernity. Publisher\u2019s page           The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter   By Patricia Crain   Richly illustrated with often antic images from alphabet books and primers, The Story of A relates the history of the alphabet as a genre of text for children and of alphabetization as a social practice in America, from early modern reading primers to the literature of the American Renaissance.   Offering a poetics of alphabetization and explicating the alphabet's tropes and rhetorical strategies, the author demonstrates the far-reaching cultural power of such apparently neutral statements as \u201cA is for apple.\u201d The new market for children's books in the eighteenth century established for the \u201crepublic of ABC\u201d a cultural potency equivalent to its high-culture counterpart, the \u201crepublic of letters,\u201d while shaping its child-readers into consumers. As a central rite of socialization, alphabetization schooled children to conflicting expectations, as well as to changing models of authority, understandings of the world, and uses of literature.   In the nineteenth century, literacy became a crucial aspect of American middle-class personality and subjectivity. Furnishing the readers and writers needed for a national literature, the alphabetization of America between 1800 and 1850 informed the sentimental-reform novel as well as the self-consciously aesthetic novel of the 1850s. Through readings of conduct manuals, reading primers, and a sentimental bestseller, the author shows how the alphabet became embedded in a maternal narrative, which organized the world through domestic affections.   Nathaniel Hawthorne, by contrast, insisted on the artificiality of the alphabet and its practices in his antimimetic, hermetic The Scarlet Letter, with its insistent focus on the letter A. By understanding this novel as part of the network of alphabetization, The Story of A accounts for its uniquely persistent cultural role. The author concludes, in an epilogue, with a reading of postmodern alphabets and their implications for the future of literacy.   Publisher\u2019s page           The Work of Writing: Literature and Social Change 1700-1830   By Clifford Siskin   \"The Work of Writing is a deeply mature piece of scholarship involving dozens upon dozens of authors from all over the long eighteenth century. Not only is its sense of the 'textual' very broad, ranging from literature, to philosophy (which, Siskin argues, once occupied the disciplinary space that Literature does today), to economics and sociology, but in requiring that we wake up and think about enlightenment processes of cultural formation, it is itself exemplary of that process. Thinking very hard and on every page, it passes its own test in an exhilarating manner.\" -- Stuart Curran, University of Pennsylvania    \"The Work of Writing establishes Cliff Siskin as one of our most subtle and theoretically sophisticated scholars of Romantic cultural studies and the New Historicism. This book, breath\u2014taking in its range, documents the growing professionalisation of writing in England in the eighteenth\u2014century, as well as the ways in which both nationalist and entrepreneurial impulses worked to exclude women writers from the new category of 'professional writer' in the nineteenth century.\" -- Anne K. Mellor, University of California, Los Angeles Publisher\u2019s page           This Is Enlightenment   By Clifford Siskin (co-edited with William Warner)   Debates about the nature of the Enlightenment date to the eighteenth century, when Imanual Kant himself addressed the question, \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d The contributors to this ambitious book offer a paradigm-shifting answer to that now-famous query: Enlightenment is an event in the history of mediation. Enlightenment, they argue, needs to be engaged within the newly broad sense of mediation introduced here\u2014not only oral, visual, written, and printed media, but everything that intervenes, enables, supplements, or is simply in between. With essays addressing infrastructure and genres, associational practices and protocols, this volume establishes mediation as the condition of possibility for enlightenment. In so doing, it not only answers Kant\u2019s query; it also poses its own broader question: how would foregrounding mediation change the kinds and areas of inquiry in our own epoch? This Is Enlightenment is a landmark volume with the polemical force and archival depth to start a conversation that extends across the disciplines that the Enlightenment itself first configured. Publisher's page           Untouchable Fictions: Literary Realism and the Crisis of Caste   By Toral Jatin Gajarawala   Untouchable Fictions considers the crisis of literary realism- progressive, rural, regionalist, experimental- in order to derive a literary genealogy for the recent explosion of Dalit (\u201cuntouchable\u201d caste) fiction. Drawing on a wide array of fiction from Premchand and Renu in Hindi to Mulk Raj Anand and V.S. Naipaul in English, Gajarawala illuminates the dark side of realist complicity: a hidden aesthetics and politics of caste. How does caste color the novel? What are its formal tendencies? What generic constraints does it produce? Untouchable Fictions juxtaposes the Dalit text, and its radical critique, with a history of progressive literary movements in South Asia. Gajarawala reads Dalit writing dialectically, doing justice to its unique and groundbreaking literary interventions while also demanding that it be read as an integral moment in the literary genealogy of the 20th and 21st century. How might we trace the origins of the rise of Dalit fiction in the critical \u201crealism\u201d of the Progressive Writers Association of the 1930s, or in the gaps laid bare by the peasant novel of the 1950s? And what kind of dialogue does \u201cuntouchable caste\u201d writing with its more famous counterpart: the Anglophone fiction of the last few decades? Under Gajarawala\u2019s lens the aesthetic languages of Hindi and English are intertwined and caste becomes a central category of literary analysis. This book, grounded in the fields of postcolonial theory, South Asian literatures, and cultural studies will be important for all readers interested in the problematic relations between aesthetics and politics, between social movements and cultural production. Engaged as it is with contemporary theories of realism and the problem of aesthetics, it would also be of interest to students of English, comparative literature, contemporary Third World literature, and historians of literary movements. More specifically, as a text that considers recent developments in genre theory and South Asian fiction, it would interest scholars of the Indian and Indian Anglophone novel. Finally, this project, as an interrogation of caste politics in the cultural sphere, is an important contribution to the burgeoning field of Dalit studies. Publisher's Page           Victorian Discourses on Sexuality and Religion   By John Maynard   John Maynard's original and provocative study looks at sexuality and religion as creations of language, in the literary and cultural discourses of Victorian England. After a wide-ranging introduction (drawing on myth, anthropology, comparative religion and the history of sexuality) Maynard goes on to articulate and interpret the strikingly complex and varied ways in which the earnest sceptic Arthur Hugh Clough, the Protestant Charles Kingsley, and the Catholic convert Coventry Patmore placed the relation of sexuality and religion at the centre of their work. A final chapter on Jude the Obscure demonstrates Thomas Hardy's deconstruction of the endeavour to make sense of sexuality and religion, fragmenting this inherited discourse into mere words and bodily parts, in a disintegration of the great constructive vision of his predecessors.

Gladstein and Dara Rossman Regaignon   Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges   presents an empirical study of the writing programs at one hundred   small, private liberal arts colleges. Jill M. Gladstein and Dara Rossman   Regaignon provide detailed information about a type of writing program   not often highlighted in the scholarly record and offer a model for such   national, multi-institutional research. Utilizing the mixed methods   approach of grounded theory, Gladstein and Regaignon weave together   survey, interview, and focus group data, site document analysis, and   institutional history. They describe the writing programs at small   colleges today as being dominated by writing across the curriculum-based   approaches to writing instruction and the writing centers as   emphasizing peer tutoring, and hence the development of undergraduate   students as leaders and scholars. For small colleges, the movement   toward vertical writing curricula, professionalized leadership   positions, and innovative writing assessments occurs when institutions   deepen or reaffirm their commitment to writing across the curriculum. In   addition, Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges offers a heuristic for understanding and comparing writing programs within and across institutions.

Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Wendy Suzuki Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  Power, Domination and Resistance AHSEM-UA 166 (class # 23136)  Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This course will introduce students to the complexities of conceptualizing and studying power. How do we determine where it lies? Who has more and who less? How do we study its mechanisms and effects, above all in view of the intuition that it is at its most effective when least observable by both agents and observers? Is power at its most effective when most imperceptible, and, if so, how are we to study it? What are the relations between the concept of \u201cpower\u201d and such related concepts as \u201cauthority,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d? What is the relationship between so-called \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d power? We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 935.001. This course can count towards the major in Sociology as either an advanced seminar or elective. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology. He studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate, writing a thesis on Durkheim under the supervision of the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Prichard. He has previously held posts in Politics and Sociology at Balliol College, Oxford; in Political and Social Theory at the European University Institute in Florence; in Moral Philosophy at the University of Siena; and in Sociology at the London School of Economics. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and an editor of the European Journal of Sociology. His writing and teaching have ranged over political science, political and moral philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and the philosophy of the social sciences. His published works include Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work; Individualism, Marxism, and Morality ; Liberals and Cannibals: The Implications of Diversity ; The Curious Enlightenment of Professor Caritat: A Comedy of Ideas (a novel soon to be reissued); and Power: A Radical View , which recently appeared in a much-expanded second edition. He is also co-editor of Rationality and Relativism and The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History . His most recent book is Moral Relativism . What is Memory? AHSEM-UA 187 (class # 19746)  Instructor: Suzanne England Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. Cross-listed with the Silver School of Social Work as UNDSW-US 79.001. Suzanne England is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 (class # 11940)  Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. In this seminar we will study the culture and politics of the Caribbean. The class is organized around key moments of Caribbean history: \u201cDiscovery;\u201d slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. While the Spanish-speaking islands (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) are at the center, the French and English-speaking Caribbean (and questions that concern the Caribbean as a region), will be part of the discussion. Readings are drawn from primary sources (slave testimonies, declarations of independence, revolutionary discourses), literary texts, film, and important essays in cultural studies/critical theory, anthropology, and history. The class will be taught in English. Reading of texts in the original language is encouraged. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002 and with History as HIST-UA 760.001. Sibylle Fischer holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Spanish from Columbia University.

Her study of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) and its impact on Caribbean national cultures, Modernity Disavowed , won book awards from the Modern Language Association, the Latin American Studies Association, The Caribbean Cultural Studies Association, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association. Jewish Women in Modern History AHSEM-UA 219 (class # 23214)  Instructor: Marion Kaplan Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. This course will approach Jewish women\u2019s history from the perspective of social history. After an introduction to the normative role of women in Judaism, the body of the course will focus on Jewish women in Modern Europe and America, analyzing their history in a variety of countries from the American and French Revolutions, through the bourgeois 19th century, World War I, the interwar era, the Nazi era, and postwar Europe and the United States. Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community.

She is co-editor of Gender and Jewish History (2010). Anthropology in the Horror Film AHSEM-UA 220 (class # 23219)  Instructor: Edward Hubbard Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. Anthropologists have appeared as protagonists and key characters in many horror films. Films like The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), Ganja and Hess (1973), Candyman (1992) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980), have pitted the anthropologist against powerful spirits and demons, accursed artifacts, mutant beasts, malevolent sorcerers and ferocious cannibals. This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure \u2013 a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition \u2013 who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries. These films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology\u2019s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship.

His forthcoming publications include articles that explore black abjection in creole cultures by way of analysis of multiple forms of ethnographic data, primarily blason populaire; an experimental piece on race and the experience of the uncanny in ethnographic research; and a monograph on the globalization of acoustic batuku music in Cape Verde. Migration, Citizenship, and Belonging AHSEM-UA 221 (class # 23220)  Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. New modalities of economic organization and relationships, innovations in technology and communication, and the sheer rate of growth of Latin American migration to U.S. cities has impacted the modes and practices of identity, community and membership in U.S. Latino communities. This course examines the normative and political dilemmas around issues of citizenship, belonging, and national identity amongst U.S. Latinos- brought about by immigration, transnationalism, neoliberalism, and globalization. These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 541.002. Arely Zimmerman holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics.

She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media. Empire and Decolonization AHSEM-UA 222 (class # 23573)  Instructor: Manu Goswami Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This class examines the global history of empire and decolonization, focusing on the case studies of the Spanish Empire from the nineteenth century and the British Empire in the twentieth century. These two great empires \u2013 the first running from the 15th to the 19th centuries, the second from the 18th to the 20th \u2013 are often contrasted as opposites: where the Spanish Empire is seen as the great bastion of medieval Catholicism, the British Empire is taken as Protestant and liberal. Where the first is thought of as founded through conquest and war, the second is often described as taking place through settlement and commerce. This course will question these oppositions, examining how both colonial projects of rule, and the nationalist movements that emerged against them, helped create the ideas and institutions associated with liberalism and democracy. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 569.001 . Manu Goswami is Associate Professor of History and the author of Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (2004). Her research interests include nationalism and internationalism, political economy and economic thought, social theory and historical methods.

Rival Monarchies: Old Regime Spain and France AHSEM-UA 223 (class # 23574)  Instructor: Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub Wednesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. In the memory of the history of Western Europe, the 16th century was Spanish, the 17th French, and the 18th British. The aim of this seminar is to tell the story of a 200 year duel between two archenemies: France and Spain from the Late Middle Ages to the eve of the Enlightenment. Both powers alternatively dominated during these 200 years. At the end of the period, Spain was still the most powerful European colonial empire and France the most threatening continental power upon the European soil. This is a story of wars, conquest and frontiers. The seminar will provide students with a dynamic overview of the rivalry of the two most powerful European monarchies and empires in the Early Modern Times, before the rising of the British power. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 275.001. Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub teaches at the Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales (Paris).

He has been visiting professor at Yale, Michigan, Oxford, Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. He is currently preparing, with Silvia Sebastiani, a new book on the creation of racial categories in Western societies from the Late Middle Ages to the Enlightenment. He has written books on a large array of topics, such as the Jewish community in the Northern African city of Oran; the union of Spanish and Portuguese crowns in Renaissance Europe; the influence of the Spanish religious and political models on absolutist France; the historical background of Aphra Behn\u2019s novel Orroonoko or The Royal Slave ; and the challenge of writing a global history of Europe. 20th Century Music: Studies in Contemporary Opera AHSEM-UA 224 (class # 23575)  Instructor: Louis Karchin Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Prerequisite: ability to read music. This course will explore operas of the 20th and 21st centuries, beginning with works emerging from the classical tradition such as Richard Strauss\u2019 comedy Der Rosenkavalier , and continuing with the groundbreaking operas of Berg, Bartok, Britten, Stravinsky and others. The second half of the course will explore such recent innovative works as John Adam\u2019s Nixon in China , Kaija Saariaho\u2019s L\u2019amour de loin , Helmut Lachenmann\u2019s Das M\u00e4dchen mit den Schwefelh\u00f6lzern , and Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s Le Grande Macabre . The course will focus on the interrelation of music and text, and consider subject matter as it reflects the cultural milieu of the times. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 111.001. Louis Karchin , Professor of Music at NYU, is the composer of over 70 works, including two operas. His first opera, Romulus , is available on a Naxos Records release that has garnered acclaim internationally.

Mr. Karchin has also been instrumental in new music advocacy, co-founding, mentoring, and often conducting performance ensembles such as the Orchestra of the League of Composers and the Washington Square Ensemble. He has written extensively on contemporary music topics. The Search for Authenticity AHSEM-UA 225 (class # 23681) Instructor: David Samuels Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. How should human beings sound? This is a question that has linked ideas about music to ideas about ethics for 100 years or more. The social and ethical dilemmas of two world wars and the global spread of industrial modernity created a challenge: how can we maintain our true humanity in the face of these traumas and disruptions? In this course we will explore three areas of musical life: folk music revivals, ethnomusicology, and historical performance movements. By attending to links between them, we will attempt to address questions about the role of \u201cauthenticity\u201d in musical and ethical discourse; how concerns about authenticity have colored critical responses to various musical styles and performers; and whether, in the end, authenticity is really what people have been worried about at all. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 153.002. David Samuels is Associate Professor of Music at NYU. He is a linguistic anthropologist, folklorist, and ethnomusicologist, and received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas. His book Putting A Song On Top of It: Music and Identity on the San Carlos Apache Reservation (University of Arizona Press, 2004) was the first book-length monograph exploring popular music\u2019s place in the formation of contemporary Indigenous identities. His current work is focused in two main areas: how missionary encounters refigured Indigenous ideologies of language, culture, and aesthetics; and the ethical ideas suffusing various musical movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. Literature and Machines AHSEM-UA 226 (class # 24031) Instructor: Nicola Cipani Tuesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. Nicola Cipani is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013). Latin America's 1968 AHSEM-UA 229 (class # 24553)  Instructor: Jill Lane Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. In Latin America, the year 1968 marked a turning point in the social, political, and cultural transformations that had had been unfolding in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed. In this course we study the complex relations between revolution, counterculture, and authoritarian rule as they emerged in Latin America\u2019s 1968: the emergence of Brazil\u2019s Cinema Novo, Cuba\u2019s imperfect cinema, and militant documentary across the region; the rise of rock and activist nueva canci\u00f3n; and the apogee of student activism and the counterculture in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We encounter 1968 through art, music, film, fiction, journalism and news coverage, along with other primary documents from the period. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is needed for this course; students with these languages may read texts in the original.

We live in the era of Big Data, with storage and transmission capacity measured not just in terabytes but in petabytes (where peta -   denotes a quadrillion, or a thousand trillion). Data collection is   constant and even insidious, with every click and every \u201clike\u201d stored   somewhere for something. This book reminds us that data is anything but   \u201craw,\u201d that we shouldn\u2019t think of data as a natural resource but as a   cultural one that needs to be generated, protected, and interpreted. The   book\u2019s essays describe eight episodes in the history of data from the   predigital to the digital. Together they address such issues as the ways   that different kinds of data and different domains of inquiry are   mutually defining; how data are variously \u201ccooked\u201d in the processes of   their collection and use; and conflicts over what can\u2014or can\u2019t\u2014be   \u201creduced\u201d to data. Contributors discuss the intellectual history of data   as a concept; describe early financial modeling and some unusual   sources for astronomical data; discover the prehistory of the database   in newspaper clippings and index cards; and consider contemporary   \u201cdataveillance\u201d of our online habits as well as the complexity of   scientific data curation.

Williams Publisher's Page                        A Companion to the History of the English Language   By Haruko Momma (Co-edited with Michael Matto)   A Companion to the History of the English Language addresses the linguistic, cultural, social, and literary approaches to language study. The first text to offer a complete survey of the field, this volume provides the most up-to-date insights of leading international scholars. \u2022 An accessible reference to the history of the English language \u2022 Comprises more than sixty essays written by leading international scholars \u2022 Aids literature students in incorporating language study into their work \u2022 Includes an historical survey of the English language, from its Germanic and Indo- European beginnings to modern British and American English \u2022 Enriched with maps, diagrams, and illustrations from historical publications \u2022 Introduces the latest scholarship in the field    Publisher\u2019s page           Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture   By Lisa Gitelman   In Always Already New, Lisa Gitelman explores the newness of new media while she asks what it means to do media history. Using the examples of early recorded sound and digital networks, Gitelman challenges readers to think about the ways that media work as the simultaneous subjects and instruments of historical inquiry. Presenting original case studies of Edison's first phonographs and the Pentagon's first distributed digital network, the ARPANET, Gitelman points suggestively toward similarities that underlie the cultural definition of records (phonographic and not) at the end of the nineteenth century and the definition of documents (digital and not) at the end of the twentieth. As a result, Always Already New speaks to present concerns about the humanities as much as to the emergent field of new media studies. Records and documents are kernels of humanistic thought, after all\u2014part of and party to the cultural impulse to preserve and interpret. Gitelman's argument suggests inventive contexts for \"humanities computing\" while also offering a new perspective on such traditional humanities disciplines as literary history.    Making extensive use of archival sources, Gitelman describes the ways in which recorded sound and digitally networked text each emerged as local anomalies that were yet deeply embedded within the reigning logic of public life and public memory. In the end Gitelman turns to the World Wide Web and asks how the history of the Web is already being told, how the Web might also resist history, and how using the Web might be producing the conditions of its own historicity. Publisher\u2019s page           Ambiguities of Witnessing: Law and Literature in the Time of a Truth Commission   By Mark Sanders   The first book to explore the complex relationship between law and literature in testimony to crimes of apartheid before South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Ambiguities of Witnessing closely analyzes key individual testimonies. Whereas most existing books on this and other truth commissions are weighed down by abstract legal and philosophical discussion, this book does justice to witnesses\u2019 public testimony in a fascinating and theoretically sophisticated investigation of questions of human rights, mourning, forgiveness, and reparation. Framed by the personal, Ambiguities of Witnessing also meditates on what it means for the writer to respond to this epochal event in the history of post-apartheid South Africa.    Publisher\u2019s page           An Ethics of Betrayal: The Politics of Otherness in Emergent U.S. Literatures and Culture   By Crystal Parikh   In An Ethics of Betrayal, Crystal Parikh investigates the theme and tropes of betrayal and treason in Asian American and Chicano/Latino literary and cultural narratives. In considering betrayal from an ethical perspective, one grounded in the theories of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, Parikh argues that the minority subject is obligated in a primary, preontological, and irrecusable relation of responsibility to the Other. Episodes of betrayal and treason allegorize the position of this subject, beholden to the many others who embody the alterity of existence and whose demands upon the subject result in transgressions of intimacy and loyalty. In this first major comparative study of narratives by and about Asian Americans and Latinos, Parikh considers writings by Frank Chin, Gish Jen, Chang-rae Lee, Eric Liu, Am\u00e9rico Parades, and Richard Rodriguez, as well as narratives about the persecution of Wen Ho Lee and the rescue and return of Elian Gonz\u00e1lez. By addressing the conflicts at the heart of filiality, the public dimensions of language in the constitution of minority \"community,\" and the mercenary mobilizations of \"model minority\" status, An Ethics of Betrayal seriously engages the challenges of conducting ethnic and critical race studies based on the uncompromising and unromantic ideas of justice, reciprocity, and ethical society. Publisher\u2019s page            Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage   By Erin B. Mee (co-edited with Helene P. Foley)   Antigone on the Contemporary World Stage is the first book to analyse what happens to Sophocles' play as it is adapted and (re)produced around the world, and the first to focus specifically on Antigone in performance. The essays, by an international gathering of noted scholars from a wide range of disciplines, highlight the numerous ways in which social, political, historical, and cultural contexts transform the material, how artists and audiences in diverse societies including Argentina, The Congo, Finland, Haiti, India, Japan, and the United States interact with it, and the variety of issues it has been used to address.      Publisher's page                  Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry   By Maureen N. McLane   This is a new history and theory of British poetry between 1760 and 1830, focusing on the relationship between Romantic poetry and the production, circulation, and textuality of ballads. By discussing the ways in which eighteenth-century cultural and literary researches flowed into and shaped key canonical works, Maureen McLane argues that Romantic poetry\u2019s influences went far beyond the merely literary. Breathing new life into the work of eighteenth-century balladeers and antiquarians, she addresses the revival of the ballad, the figure of the minstrel, and the prevalence of a \u201cminstrelsy complex\u201d in Romanticism. Furthermore, she envisages a new way of engaging with Romantic poetics, encompassing both \u201coral\u201d and \u201cliterary\u201d modes of poetic construction, and anticipates the role that technology might play in a media-driven twenty-first century. The study will be of great interest to scholars and students of Romantic poetry, literature, and culture.  Publisher\u2019s page           Citizen Shakespeare: Freemen and Aliens in the Language of the Plays   By John Michael Archer   Shakespeare lived his professional life amid the London streets and died a prominent figure in the town of Stratford. The language of his plays is shot through with the concerns of London \"freemen\" and their wives, the diverse commercial class that nevertheless excluded adult immigrants from country towns and northern Europe alike. This book combines London historiography, close reading, and recent theories of citizen subjectivity to demonstrate for the first time that Shakespeare's plays embody citizen and alien identities despite their aristocratic settings. The book points out where the city shadows the country scenes of the major comedies, shows how London's trades animate the \"civil butchery\" of the history plays, and explains why England's metropolis becomes the fractured Rome of tragedy.    Publisher\u2019s page           Course in General Linguistics   By Perry Meisel (translated by Wade Baskin and co-edited with Haun Saussy)   The founder of modern linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure inaugurated semiology, structuralism, and deconstruction and made possible the work of Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan, thus enabling the development of French feminism, gender studies, New Historicism, and postcolonialism. Based on Saussure\u2019s lectures, Course in General Linguistics (1916) traces the rise and fall of the historical linguistics in which Saussure was trained, the synchronic or structural linguistics with which he replaced it, and the new look of diachronic linguistics that followed this change. Most important, Saussure presents the principles of a new linguistic science that includes the invention of semiology, or the theory of the \u201csignifier,\u201d the \u201csignified,\u201d and the \u201csign\u201d that they combine to produce.     This is the first critical edition of Course in General Linguistics to appear in English and restores Wade Baskin\u2019s original translation of 1959, in which the terms \u201csignifier\u201d and \u201csignified\u201d are introduced into English in this precise way. Baskin renders Saussure clearly and accessibly, allowing readers to experience his shift of the theory of reference from mimesis to performance and his expansion of poetics to include all media, including the life sciences and environmentalism. An introduction situates Saussure within the history of ideas and describes the history of scholarship that made Course in General Linguistics legendary. New endnotes enlarge Saussure\u2019s contexts to include literary criticism, cultural studies, and philosophy.        Publisher\u2019s page           Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation   By John Guillory   John Guillory challenges the most fundamental premises of the canon   debate by resituating the problem of canon formation in an entirely new   theoretical framework. The result is a book that promises to recast not   only the debate about the literary curriculum but also the controversy   over \"multiculturalism\" and the current \"crisis of the humanities.\"   Employing concepts drawn from Pierre Bourdieu's sociology, Guillory   argues that canon formation must be understood less as a question of the   representation of social groups than as a question of the distribution   of \"cultural capital\" in the schools, which regulate access to literacy,   to the practices of reading and writing. Publisher's Page           Culture in Camouflage: War, Empire, and Modern British Literature   By Patrick Deer   Culture in Camouflage aims to remap the history of British war culture by insisting on the centrality and importance of the literature of the Second World War. The book offers the first comprehensive account of the emergence of modern war culture, arguing that its exceptional forms and temporalities force us to reappraise British cultural modernity. The book explores how writers like Ford Madox Ford, Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, T.E. Lawrence, Winston Churchill,Elizabeth Bowen, Virginia Woolf, James Hanley, Rex Warner, Alexander Baron, Keith Douglas, Henry Green, and Graham Greene contested the dominant narratives of war projected by an enormously powerful and persuasive mass media and culture industry. Patrick Deer reads war literature as one element in an expanded cultural field, which also includes popular culture and mass communications, the productions of war planners and military historians, projections of new technologies of violence, the fantasies and theories of strategists, and the material culture of total war. Modern war cultures, Deer contends, are defined by their drive to normalize conflict and war-making, by their struggle to colonize the entire wartime cultural field, and by their claim to monopolize representations and interpretation of the conflict. But the mobilization of cultural formations during wartime reveals, at times glaringly, the constitutive contradictions at the heart of modern ideas of culture. The Great War failed to produce a popular war culture on the home front, producing instead an extraordinary literature of protest, yet the strategists struggled to regain their oversight over both the enemy across no man's land, and the minds and bodies of their own mass conscript armies. The interwar years saw a massive effort to make strategic fantasies a reality; if the technology of imperial air power or mobile armoured warfare did not yet exist, culture could be mobilized to shore up the ramshackle war machine. During World War Two a fully fledged British war culture emerged triumphant in time of national crisis, offering the vision of a fully mobilized island fortress, a loyal empire, and a modernized war machine ready to wage a futuristic war of space and movement. This was the struggle that British World War Two writers confronted with extraordinary courage and creativity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Digital Literary Studies: Corpus Approaches to Poetry, Prose, and Drama   By David L. Hoover, Jonathan Culpeper, and Kieran O'Halloran   Digital Literary Studies presents a broad and varied picture of the promise and potential of methods and approaches that are crucially dependent upon the digital nature of the literary texts it studies and the texts and collections of texts with which they are compared. It focuses on style, diction, characterization, and interpretation of single works and across larger groups of texts, using both huge natural language corpora and smaller, more specialized collections of texts created for specific tasks, and applies statistical techniques used in the narrower confines of authorship attribution to broader stylistic questions. It addresses important issues in each of the three major literary genres, and intentionally applies different techniques and concepts to poetry, prose, and drama. It aims to present a provocative and suggestive sample intended to encourage the application of these and other methods to literary studies.     Hoover, Culpeper, and O\u2019Halloran push the methods, techniques, and concepts in new directions, apply them to new groups of texts or to new questions, modify their nature or method of application, and combine them in innovative ways.      Publisher's page           Elinor James   By Paula McDowell   This volume makes available for the first time the complete surviving works of the London printer-author Elinor James (c.1645-1719). Uniquely in the history of early modern women, James wrote, printed and distributed more than ninety pamphlets and broadsides addressing political, religious and commercial concerns. Written over a period of 35 years, her works provide us with a running commentary on the major national events of a tumultuous period such as the Revolution of 1688, the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, and the Jacobite uprisings in 1715-16. During her lifetime, England saw the succession of six different monarchs. James petitioned all of them and claimed to have obtained audiences with three. In 1689 she was gaoled in Newgate prison, accused of disseminating seditious material condemning William III for accepting the English crown.    James's texts address a staggeringly broad range of concerns. She petitioned Parliament concerning legislation affecting the printing trades and petitioned fellow printers concerning labour relations in London printing houses. She petitioned City authorities on issues such as the enforcement of bylaws or who to vote for in City and parliamentary elections. It is hoped that by making available all of James's known works, this volume will inspire the collective efforts of scholars from many different disciplines to decipher her references to contemporary events, issues and persons, as well as prompting further discoveries of as yet unidentified works.    Publisher\u2019s page              Epic Traditions in the Contemporary World: The Poetics of Community   By Susanne Wofford (co-edited with Margaret Beissinger and Jane Tylus)   The epic tradition has been part of many different cultures throughout human history. This noteworthy collection of essays provides a comparative reassessment of epic and its role in the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds, as it explores the variety of contemporary approaches to the epic genre. Employing theoretical perspectives drawn from anthropology, literary studies, and gender studies, the authors examine familiar and less well known oral and literary traditions\u2014ancient Greek and Latin, Arabic, South Slavic, Indian, Native American, Italian, English, and Caribbean\u2014demonstrating the continuing vitality of the epic tradition.    Juxtaposing work on the traditional canon of western epics with scholarship on contemporary epics from various parts of the world, these essays cross the divide between oral and literary forms that has long marked the approach to the genre. With its focus on the links among narrative, politics, and performance, the collection creates a new dialogue illustrating the sociopolitical significance of the epic tradition. Taken together, the essays raise compelling new issues for the study of epic, as they examine concerns such as national identity, gender, pedagogy, and the creation of the canon.    Publisher\u2019s page           Feeling Beauty: The Neuroscience of Aesthetic Experience   By G. Gabrielle Starr                         In Feeling Beauty, G. Gabrielle Starr   argues that understanding the neural underpinnings of aesthetic   experience can reshape our conceptions of aesthetics and the arts.   Drawing on the tools of both cognitive neuroscience and traditional   humanist inquiry, Starr shows that neuroaesthetics offers a new model   for understanding the dynamic and changing features of aesthetic life,   the relationships among the arts, and how individual differences in   aesthetic judgment shape the varieties of aesthetic experience.     Starr, a scholar of the humanities and a researcher in the   neuroscience of aesthetics, proposes that aesthetic experience relies on   a distributed neural architecture\u2014a set of brain areas involved in   emotion, perception, imagery, memory, and language. More important, it   emerges from networked interactions, intricately connected and   coordinated brain systems that together form a flexible architecture   enabling us to develop new arts and to see the world around us   differently. Focusing on the \u201csister arts\u201d of poetry, painting, and   music, Starr builds and tests a neural model of aesthetic experience   valid across all the arts. Asking why works that address different   senses using different means seem to produce the same set of feelings,   she examines particular works of art in a range of media, including a   poem by Keats, a painting by van Gogh, a sculpture by Bernini, and   Beethoven\u2019s Diabelli Variations. Starr\u2019s innovative, interdisciplinary   analysis is true to the complexities of both the physical instantiation   of aesthetics and the realities of artistic representation. Publisher's Page                        Fieldworks: From Place to Site in Postwar Poetics   By Lytle Shaw   Fieldworks offers a historical account of the social, rhetorical, and material attempts to ground art and poetry in the physicality of a site. Arguing that place-oriented inquiries allowed poets and artists to develop new, experimental models of historiography and ethnography, Lytle Shaw draws out the shifting terms of this practice from World War II to the present through a series of illuminating case studies. Beginning with the alternate national genealogies unearthed by William Carlos Williams in Paterson and Charles Olson in Gloucester, Shaw demonstrates how subsequent poets sought to ground such inquiries in concrete social formations\u2014to in effect live the poetics of place: Gary Snyder in his back-to-the-land familial compound, Kitkitdizze; Amiri Baraka in a black nationalist community in Newark; Robert Creeley and the poets of Bolinas, California, in the capacious \u201cnow\u201d of their poet-run town. Turning to the work of Robert Smithson\u2014who called one of his essays an \u201cappendix to Paterson,\u201d and who in turn has exerted a major influence on poets since the 1970s\u2014Shaw then traces the emergence of site-specific art in relation both to the poetics of place and to the larger linguistic turn in the humanities, considering poets including Clark Coolidge, Bernadette Mayer, and Lisa Robertson. By putting the poetics of place into dialog with site-specificity in art, Shaw demonstrates how poets and artists became experimental explicators not just of concrete locations and their histories, but of the discourses used to interpret sites more broadly. It is this dual sense of fieldwork that organizes Shaw\u2019s groundbreaking history of site-specific poetry. Publisher's Page           Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies   By Elizabeth McHenry   Over the past decade the popularity of black writers including E. Lynn Harris and Terry McMillan has been hailed as an indication that an active African American reading public has come into being. Yet this is not a new trend; there is a vibrant history of African American literacy, literary associations, and book clubs. Forgotten Readers reveals that neglected past, looking at the reading practices of free blacks in the antebellum north and among African Americans following the Civil War. It places the black upper and middle classes within American literary history, illustrating how they used reading and literary conversation as a means to assert their civic identities and intervene in the political and literary cultures of the United States from which they were otherwise excluded. Forgotten Readers expands our definition of literacy and urges us to think of literature as broadly as it was conceived of in the nineteenth century. Elizabeth McHenry delves into archival sources, including the records of past literary societies and the unpublished writings of their members. She examines particular literary associations, including the Saturday Nighters of Washington, D.C., whose members included Jean Toomer and Georgia Douglas Johnson. She shows how black literary societies developed, their relationship to the black press, and the ways that African American women\u2019s clubs\u2014which flourished during the 1890s\u2014encouraged literary activity. In an epilogue, McHenry connects this rich tradition of African American interest in books, reading, and literary conversation to contemporary literary phenomena such as Oprah Winfrey\u2019s book club. Forgotten Readers redirects contemporary thinking about the origins of African American literature and adds a vital element to scholarship on the history of the book. Publisher\u2019s page           Frank O&rsquo;Hara: The Poetics of Coterie   By Lytle Shaw   O\u2019Hara\u2019s poems are famously filled with proper names\u2014from those of his immediate friends and colleagues in the New York writing and art worlds (John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Grace Hartigan, Willem de Kooning, and many musicians, dancers, and filmmakers) to a broad range of popular cultural and literary heroes (Apollinaire to Jackie O). But rather than understand O\u2019Hara\u2019s most commonly referenced names as a fixed and insular audience, Shaw argues that he uses the ambiguities of reference associated with the names to invent a fluid and shifting kinship structure\u2014one that opened up radical possibilities for a gay writer operating outside the structure of the family.    As Shaw demonstrates, this commitment to an experimental model of association also guides O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing. Like his poetry, O\u2019Hara\u2019s art writing too has been condemned as insular, coterie writing. In fact, though, he was alone among 1950s critics in his willingness to consider abstract expressionism not only within the dominant languages of existentialism and formalism but also within the cold war political and popular cultural frameworks that anticipate many of the concerns of contemporary art historians. Situating O\u2019Hara within a range of debates about art\u2019s possible relations to its audience, Shaw demonstrates that his interest in coterie is less a symptomatic offshoot of his biography than a radical literary and artistic invention.    Publisher\u2019s page           From Philology to English Studies: Language and Culture in the Nineteenth Century   By Haruko Momma   The study of English language and literature in Britain changed dramatically between the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. From Philology to English Studies explores the contribution of philology to this evolution. Haruko Momma charts both the rise and fall of philology from antiquity to the late eighteenth century, and the impact of modern philology on the study of modern languages and literatures. Focusing in detail on the work of key philologists in the nineteenth century, Momma considers how they shaped European discourse and especially vernacular studies in Britain: William Jones' discovery of Sanskrit in British India gave rise to Indo-European studies; Max M\u00fcller's study of this same language helped spread the Aryan myth to the English-speaking world; the OED achieved its greatness as a post-national lexicon through the editorship of the Scottish dialectologist. Publisher's Page           Genres of the Credit Economy: Mediating Value in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain   By Mary Poovey   How did banking, borrowing, investing, and even losing money\u2014in other words, participating in the modern financial system\u2014come to seem like routine activities of everyday life? Genres of the Credit Economy addresses this question by examining the history of financial instruments and representations of finance in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. Chronicling the process by which some of our most important conceptual categories were naturalized, Mary Poovey explores complex relationships among forms of writing that are not usually viewed together, from bills of exchange and bank checks, to realist novels and Romantic poems, to economic theory and financial journalism. Taking up all early forms of financial and monetary writing, Poovey argues that these genres mediated for early modern Britons the operations of a market system organized around credit and debt. By arguing that genre is a critical tool for historical and theoretical analysis and an agent in the events that formed the modern world, Poovey offers a new way to appreciate the character of the credit economy and demonstrates the contribution historians and literary scholars can make to understanding its operations. Much more than an exploration of writing on and around money, Genres of the Credit Economy offers startling insights about the evolution of disciplines and the separation of factual and fictional genres.    Publisher\u2019s page           Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England   By Juliet Fleming   Graffiti and the Writing Arts of Early Modern England is an   excavation of a series of previously unknown or disregarded writing   practices. Our modern assumptions regarding written expression have   limited our examination of the history of writing and literacy to that   which has been preserved in print or manuscript. In a work of tremendous   originality and intellectual daring, Fleming brings detailed historical   scholarship into dialogue with the challenge of contemporary theory to   explore a lost realm where writing practices moved off the boundaries of   the page to fill windows, body surfaces, ceramics, ceilings, and walls. Developing   and drawing on an archive that has until now been closed to literary   scholars, Fleming argues that the whitewashed wall was the primary   writing apparatus of the early modern English, recovers the tattoo   practices of sixteenth-century Europeans, and demonstrates how to read   the poetic burden of early modern crockery. Her book is a work of   cultural history that provides a startling new perspective on early   modern writing, one that swerves from the preoccupations of generations   of scholars in order to transform the fundamental terms of literary   inquiry.

Publisher\u2019s page           Heart Beats: Everyday Life and the Memorized Poem   By Catherine Robson   Many people in Great Britain and the United States can recall elderly relatives who remembered long stretches of verse learned at school decades earlier, yet most of us were never required to recite in class. Heart Beats is the first book to examine how poetry recitation came to assume a central place in past curricular programs, and to investigate when and why the once-mandatory exercise declined. Telling the story of a lost pedagogical practice and its wide-ranging effects on two sides of the Atlantic, Catherine Robson explores how recitation altered the ordinary people who committed poems to heart, and changed the worlds in which they lived. Heart Beats begins by investigating recitation's progress within British and American public educational systems over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and weighs the factors that influenced which poems were most frequently assigned. Robson then scrutinizes the recitational fortunes of three short works that were once classroom classics: Felicia Hemans's \"Casabianca,\" Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,\" and Charles Wolfe's \"Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna.\" To conclude, the book considers W. E. Henley's \"Invictus\" and Rudyard Kipling's \"If--,\" asking why the idea of the memorized poem arouses such different responses in the United States and Great Britain today. Focusing on vital connections between poems, individuals, and their communities, Heart Beats is an important study of the history and power of memorized poetry. Publisher's Page           Heartbreakers: Women and Violence in Contemporary Culture and Literature   By Josephine Gattuso Hendin   From   Medea to Goneril to Sharon Stone's ice-pick murderer, the violent woman   has fascinated readers and audiences. Josephine Hendin looks at this   figure and argues that a violent woman is a grenade pitched toward both   conservative and liberal views of women.                                 Publisher's Page           How Soon is Now? Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and The Queerness of Time   By Carolyn Dinshaw   How Soon Is Now? performs a powerful critique of modernist temporal regimes through its revelatory exploration of queer ways of being in time as well as of the potential queerness of time itself. Carolyn Dinshaw focuses on medieval tales of asynchrony and on engagements with these medieval temporal worlds by amateur readers centuries later. In doing so, she illuminates forms of desirous, embodied being that are out of sync with ordinarily linear measurements of everyday life, that involve multiple temporalities, that precipitate out of time altogether. Dinshaw claims the possibility of a fuller, denser, more crowded now that theorists tell us is extant but that often eludes our temporal grasp. Whether discussing Victorian men of letters who parodied the Book of John Mandeville, a fictionalized fourteenth-century travel narrative, or Hope Emily Allen, modern coeditor of the early-fifteenth-century Book of Margery Kempe, Dinshaw argues that these and other medievalists outside the academy inhabit different temporalities than modern professionals operating according to the clock. How Soon Is Now? clears space for amateurs, hobbyists, and dabblers who approach medieval worlds from positions of affect and attachment, from desires to build other kinds of worlds. Unruly, untimely, they urge us toward a disorderly and asynchronous collective Publisher's page           Imaginary Worlds in Medieval Books: Exploring the Manuscript Matrix   By Martha Rust   This book envisions the confines of medieval manuscripts as the potential territory of many virtual worlds: realms that readers call forth through their imaginative interactions with a book\u2019s material features. Each component of a medieval manuscript--its alphabetical characters, pages, images, text, gloss--offers an avenue of involvement with the world of books, and with the worldsin books. The explorations presented here follow those paths in a selection of manuscripts and texts produced in late-medieval Britain, tracing the fortunes of characters who become subject to and sometimes subjects in the very books the read and write.    Publisher\u2019s page           In Visible Movement   By Tom&aacute;s Urayo&aacute;n Noel   The first book-length study specifically devoted to Nuyorican poetry, In Visible Movement    is unique in its historical and formal breadth, ranging from the   foundational poets of the 1960s and 1970s to a variety of contemporary   poets emerging in and around the Nuyorican Poets Cafe \u201cslam\u201d scene of   the 1990s and early 2000s. It also unearths a largely unknown corpus of   poetry performances, reading over forty years of Nuyorican poetry at the   intersection of the printed and performed word, underscoring the   poetry\u2019s links to vernacular and Afro-Puerto Rican performance cultures,   from the island\u2019s oral poets to the New York sounds and rhythms of   Latin boogaloo, salsa, and hip-hop. With depth and insight, Urayo\u00e1n Noel   analyzes various canonical Nuyorican poems by poets such as Pedro   Pietri, Victor Hern\u00e1ndez Cruz, Miguel Algar\u00edn, Miguel Pi\u00f1ero, Sandra   Mar\u00eda Esteves, and Tato Laviera. He discusses historically overlooked   poets such as Lorraine Sutton, innovative poets typically read outside   the Nuyorican tradition such as Frank Lima and Edwin Torres, and a   younger generation of Nuyorican-identified poets including Willie   Perdomo, Mar\u00eda Teresa Mariposa Fern\u00e1ndez, and Emanuel Xavier, whose work   has received only limited critical consideration. The result is a   stunning reflection of how New York Puerto Rican poets have addressed   the complexity of identity amid diaspora for over forty years.           Land/Scape/Theater   By Una Chaudhuri (Co-edited with Elinor Fuchs)   Land/Scape/Theater proposes landscape as a necessary paradigm for understanding modern theater's increasingly spatialized aesthetic as well as its engagement with the cultural meanings of place and space.    Embracing subjects as diverse as the \"landscape dramaturgy\" of Suzan-Lori Parks, Artaud's trip to the Sierra Madre,Gertrude Stein's landscape theory and practice, Guillermo Gomez-Pe\u00f1a's \"border subjects,\" and Bayreuth and Disneyland as cultic sites, Land/Scape/Theater draws on a broad range of theory, dramatic texts, and performance. All aspects of modern theater, these essays suggest, including the bedrock Aristotelian constituents of plot and character, have a landscape dimension that often goes unrecognized.    With its broad theoretical range and cross-disciplinary reach, Land/Scape/Theater will interest theater theorists and practitioners and cultural studies specialists, including historians of landscape. Theater students, scholars, teachers, directors, designers, and actors will find here a new framework and a new vocabulary for understanding both theater and the larger culture.    Publisher\u2019s page           London Calling: How Black and Asian Writers Imagined a City   By Sukhdev Sandhu   From the 11th century, when one commentator claimed the capital was being over-run with Moors, to the garage MCs and street poets of today \u2013 this book tells the story of life in London for black and Asian people from the seventeenth century until today. London Calling tells the story of black and Asian literary London, tracing the escapades, fortune making, and self-expansion of these forgotten writers. It is a joyful and often rapturous work, a love letter to the capital, a teeming and complex mix of social and cultural history seen through the imagination and experience of great black and Asian writers. London Calling gets to the heart of the immigration impulse, and evokes the dreams and adventures of those who have sought refuge and asylum in the cradle of Empire. The book is populated by runaway slaves, lotharios, imams, boxer-pimps, rajahs and colonial revolutionaries, and discusses writers as diverse in style and time as the 18th-century grocer-aesthete Ignatius Sancho right through to Rushdie, Kureishi and yardie chronicler Victor Headley. The result is an exciting work, brimming with life, as it spotlights a rich but neglected literary tradition, and brings to life a gaping void in the city's history. Placing the multiculturalism of today's capital in its historical context, Sukhdev Sandhu shows that it is no new phenomenon, and that just as London has been the making of many black writers, they too have been the making of London.    Publisher's page           Lyric Generations: Poetry and the Novel in the Long Eighteenth Century   By Gabrielle Starr   Eighteenth\u2014century British literary history is traditionally characterized by two central and seemingly discrete movements: the rise of the novel and the development of Romantic lyric poetry. In fact, recent scholarship reveals that these genres are inextricably bound: constructions of interiority developed in novels changed ideas about what literature could mean and do, encouraging the new focus on private experience and self\u2014perception developed in lyric poetry.    In Lyric Generations Gabrielle Starr rejects the usual genealogy of lyric poetry in which Romantic poets are thought to have built solely and directly upon the works of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton. She argues instead that novelists such as Richardson, Haywood, Behn and others, while drawing upon earlier lyric conventions, ushered in a new language of self\u2014expression and community that profoundly affected the aesthetic goals of lyric poets. Examining the works of Cowper, Smith, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats in light of their competitive dialogue with the novel, Starr advances a literary history that considers formal characteristics as products of historical change. In a world increasingly defined by prose, poets adapted the new forms, characters, and moral themes of the novel in order to reinvigorate poetic practice. Publisher\u2019s page           Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentleman   By Catherine Robson   Fascination with little girls pervaded Victorian culture. For many, girls represented the true essence of childhood or bygone times of innocence; but for middle-class men, especially writers, the interest ran much deeper. In Men in Wonderland, Catherine Robson explores the ways in which various nineteenth-century British male authors constructed girlhood, and analyzes the nature of their investment in the figure of the girl. In so doing, she reveals the link between the idealization of little girls and a widespread fantasy of male development--a myth suggesting that men become masculine only after an initial feminine stage, lived out in the protective environment of the nursery. Little girls, argues Robson, thus offer an adult male the best opportunity to reconnect with his own lost self.    Tracing the beginnings of this myth in the writings of Romantics Wordsworth and De Quincey, Robson identifies the consolidation of this paradigm in numerous Victorian artifacts, ranging from literary works by Dickens and Barrett Browning, to paintings by Frith and Millais, to reports of the Royal Commission on Children's Employment. She analyzes Ruskin and Carroll's \"high noon\" of girl worship and investigates the destruction of the fantasy in the closing decades of the century, when social concerns about the working girl sexualized the image of young females.    Men in Wonderland contributes to a growing interest in the nineteenth century's construction of childhood, sexuality, and masculinity, and illuminates their complex interconnections with a startlingly different light. Not only does it complicate the narratives of pedophilic desire that are generally used to explain figures like Ruskin and Carroll, but it offers a new understanding of the Victorian era's obsession with loss, its rampant sentimentality, and its intense valorization of the little girl at the expense of mature femininity.    Publisher\u2019s page           Middle English Literature: A Cultural History   By Christopher Cannon   Polity, 2008. This book provides a boldly original account of Middle English literature from the Norman Conquest to the beginning of the sixteenth century. It argues that these centuries are, in fundamental ways, the momentous period in our literary history, for they are the long moment in which the category of literature itself emerged as English writing began to insist, for the first time, that it floated free of any social reality or function. This book also charts the complex mechanisms by which English writing acquired this power in a series of linked close readings of both canonical and more obscure texts. It encloses those readings in five compelling accounts of much broader cultural areas, describing, in particular, the productive relationship of Middle English writing to medieval technology, insurgency, statecraft and cultural place, concluding with an in depth account of the particular arguments, emphases and techniques English writers used to claim a wholly new jurisdiction for their work. Both this history and its readings are everywhere informed by the most exciting developments in recent Middle English scholarship as well as literary and cultural theory. It serves as an introduction to all these areas as well as a contribution, in its own right, to each of them. Publisher\u2019s page           Modernisms: A Literary Guide   By Peter Nicholls   University of California, 2009. The recent enthusiasm for things postmodern has often produced a caricature of Modernism as monolithic and reactionary. Peter Nicholls argues instead that the distinctive feature of Modernism is its diversity. Through a lively analysis of each of Modernism's main literary movements, he explores the connections between the new stylistic developments and the shifting politics of gender and authority.\u2028\u2028Nicholls introduces a wealth of literary experimentation, beginning with Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9 and moving forward to the first avant-gardes. Close readings of key texts monitor the explosive histories of Futurism, Expressionism, Cubism, Dada, and Surrealism, histories that allow Anglo-American Modernism to be seen in a strikingly different light. In revealing Modernism's broad and varied terrain, Nicholls evokes the richness of a cultural moment that continues to shape our own. Publisher\u2019s page           My Poets   By Maureen N. McLane   \u201cOh! there are spirits of the air,\u201d wrote Percy Bysshe Shelley. In this stunningly original book, Maureen N. McLane channels the spirits and voices that make up the music in one poet\u2019s mind. Weaving criticism and memoir, My Poets explores a life reading and a life read. McLane invokes not necessarily the best poets, nor the most important poets (whoever these might be), but those writers who, in possessing her, made her. \u201cI am marking here what most marked me,\u201d she writes. Ranging from Chaucer to H.D. to William Carlos Williams to Louise Gl\u00fcck to Shelley (among others), McLane tracks the \u201cgrowth of a poet\u2019s mind,\u201d as Wordsworth put it in The Prelude. In poetical prose both probing and incantatory, McLane has written a radical book of experimental criticism. Susan Sontag called for an \u201cerotics of interpretation\u201d: this is it. Part Bildung, part dithyramb, part exegesis, My Poets extends an implicit invitation to you, dear reader, to consider who your \u201cmy poets,\u201d or \u201cmy novelists,\u201d or \u201cmy filmmakers,\u201d or \u201cmy pop stars,\u201d might be. Publisher's Page           Negative Liberties: Morrison, Pynchon, and the Problem of Liberal Ideology   By Cyrus R. K. Patell   Since the nineteenth century, ideas centered on the individual, on Emersonian self-reliance, and on the right of the individual to the pursuit of happiness have had a tremendous presence in the United States\u2014and even more so after the Reagan era. But has this presence been for the good of all? In Negative Liberties Cyrus R. K. Patell revises important ideas in the debate about individualism and the political theory of liberalism. He does so by adding two new voices to the current discussion\u2014Toni Morrison and Thomas Pynchon\u2014to examine the different ways in which their writings embody, engage, and critique the official narrative generated by U.S. liberal ideology.    Pynchon and Morrison reveal the official narrative of individualism as encompassing a complex structure of contradiction held in abeyance. This narrative imagines that the goals of the individual are not at odds with the goals of the family or society and in fact obscures the existence of an unholy truce between individual liberty and forms of oppression. By bringing these two fiction writers into a discourse dominated by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Isaiah Berlin, John Rawls, George Kateb, Robert Bellah, and Michael Sandel, Patell unmasks the ways in which contemporary U.S. culture has not fully shed the oppressive patterns of reasoning handed down by the slaveholding culture from which American individualism emerged. With its interdisciplinary approach, Negative Liberties will appeal to students and scholars of American literature, culture, sociology, and politics.    Publisher\u2019s page           Nineteenth-Century Lives   By Laurence S. Lockridge   In Nineteenth-Century Lives ten distinguished critics and biographers consider what it means to narrate a life. Their illustrative texts are largely taken from nineteenth-century biography, autobiography and the novel, but narrative is the broader genre that unites their various inquiries. The principal issues, theoretical and practical, are framed by Margaret Atwood, J. Hillis Miller and Phyllis Rose. 'The biographer, like the novelist, is a constructor of narratives; it's just that the ground rules are a little different,' writes Atwood. Among the matters they debate are the boundaries of fact and fiction, the professed power of the narrator, and the figurative underpinings of autobiography. But many of these essays are delightful and provocative biographical and autobiographical excursions in themselves. Atwood describes her early fear of biography, Morton Cohen narrates an exciting bit of detective work into the life of Lewis Carroll, and John Rosenberg gives a vivid and frequently revisionary reading of many aspects of Darwin's life. Other critics - Carl Woodring, Richard Altick, Norman Kelvin, Margaret Stetz, and Robert Kiely - consider related topics: the autobiographical poem as Bildungsroman, the nineteenth-century art biography, the relationship of William Morris's life to the structural principles of his art, the guilt-ridden fiction of the 1890s, and a seemingly marginal character in fiction, the 'nobody'.    Publisher\u2019s page           On Eloquence   By Denis Donoghue   On Eloquence questions the common assumption that eloquence is merely a subset of rhetoric, a means toward a rhetorical end. Denis Donoghue, an eminent and prolific critic of the English language, holds that this assumption is erroneous. While rhetoric is the use of language to persuade people to do one thing rather than another, Donoghue maintains that eloquence is \u201cgratuitous, ideally autonomous, in speech and writing an upsurge of creative vitality for its own sake.\u201d He offers many instances of eloquence in words, and suggests the forms our appreciation of them should take.    Donoghue argues persuasively that eloquence matters, that we should indeed care about it. \u201cBecause we should care about any instances of freedom, independence, creative force, sprezzatura,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially when we live\u2014perhaps this is increasingly the case\u2014in a culture of the same, featuring official attitudes, stereotypes of the officially enforced values, sedated language, a politics of pacification.\u201d A noteworthy addition to Donoghue\u2019s long-term project to reclaim a disinterested appreciation of literature as literature, this volume is a wise and pleasurable meditation on eloquence, its unique ability to move or give pleasure, and its intrinsic value. Publisher\u2019s page           Plague Writing in Early Modern England   By Ernest B. Gilman   University of Chicago, 2009. During the seventeenth century, England was beset by three epidemics of the bubonic plague, each outbreak claiming between a quarter and a third of the population of London and other urban centers. Surveying a wide range of responses to these epidemics\u2014sermons, medical tracts, pious exhortations, satirical pamphlets, and political commentary\u2014Plague Writing in Early Modern England brings to life the many and complex ways Londoners made sense of such unspeakable devastation. Ernest B. Gilman argues that the plague writing of the period attempted unsuccessfully to rationalize the catastrophic and that its failure to account for the plague as an instrument of divine justice fundamentally threatened the core of Christian belief. Gilman also trains his critical eye on the works of Jonson, Donne, Pepys, and Defoe, which, he posits, can be more fully understood when put into the context of this century-long project to \u201cwrite out\u201d the plague. Ultimately, Plague Writing in Early Modern England is more than a compendium of artifacts of a bygone era; it holds up a distant mirror to reflect our own condition in the age of AIDS, super viruses, multidrug resistant tuberculosis, and the hovering threat of a global flu pandemic. Publisher's page           Private Affairs: Critical Ventures in the Culture of Social Relations   By Phillip Brian Harper   In Private Affairs, Phillip Brian Harper explores the social and cultural significance of the private, proposing that, far from a universal right, privacy is limited by one's racial-and sexual-minority status. Ranging across cinema, literature, sculpture, and lived encounters-from Rodin's The Kiss to Jenny Livingston's Paris is Burning-Private Affairs demonstrates how the very concept of privacy creates personal and sociopolitical hierarchies in contemporary America. Publisher\u2019s page           Republic of Intellect: The Friendly Club of New York City and the Making of American Literature   By Bryan Waterman   In the 1790s, a single conversational circle -- the Friendly Club -- united New York City's most ambitious young writers, and in Republic of Intellect, Bryan Waterman uses an innovative blend of literary criticism and historical narrative to re\u2014create the club's intellectual culture. The story of the Friendly Club reveals the mutually informing conditions of authorship, literary association, print culture, and production of knowledge in a specific time and place -- the tumultuous, tenuous world of post\u2014revolutionary New York City. More than any similar group in the early American republic, the Friendly Club occupied a crossroads -- geographical, professional, and otherwise -- of American literary and intellectual culture.    Waterman argues that the relationships among club members' novels, plays, poetry, diaries, legal writing, and medical essays lead to important first examples of a distinctively American literature and also illuminate the local, national, and transatlantic circuits of influence and information that club members called \"the republic of intellect.\" He addresses topics ranging from political conspiracy in the gothic novels of Charles Brockden Brown to the opening of William Dunlap's Park Theatre, from early American debates on gendered conversation to the publication of the first American medical journal. Voluntary association and print culture helped these young New Yorkers, Waterman concludes, to produce a broader and more diverse post\u2014revolutionary public sphere than scholars have yet recognized. Publisher\u2019s page           Securing the Commonwealth: Debt, Speculation, and Writing in the Making of Early America   By Jennifer J. Baker   Securing the Commonwealth examines how eighteenth\u2014century American writers understood the highly speculative financial times in which they lived. Spanning a century of cultural and literary life, this study shows how the era's literature commonly depicted an American ethos of risk taking and borrowing as the peculiar product of New World daring and the exigencies of revolution and nation building.    Some of the century's most important writers, including Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin, Royall Tyler, Charles Brockden Brown, and Judith Sargent Murray, believed that economic and social commonwealth -- and one's commitment to that commonwealth -- might be grounded in indebtedness and financial insecurity. These writers believed a cash\u2014poor colony or nation could not only advance itself through borrowing but also gain reputability each time it successfully paid off a loan. Equally important, they believed that debt could promote communality: precarious public credit structures could exact popular commitment; intricate financial networks could bind individuals to others and to their government; and indebtedness itself could evoke sympathy for the suffering of others.    Close readings of their literary works reveal how these writers imagined that public life might be shaped by economic experience, and how they understood the public life of literature itself. Insecure times strengthened their conviction that writing could be publicly serviceable, persuading readers to invest in their government, in their fellow Americans, and in the idea of America itself.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing   By Carolyn Dinshaw (Co-edited with David Wallace)   The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Women's Writing seeks to recover the lives and particular experiences of medieval women by concentrating on various kinds of texts: the texts they wrote themselves as well as texts that attempted to shape, limit, or expand their lives. The first section investigates the roles traditionally assigned to medieval women (as virgins, widows, and wives); it also considers female childhood and relations between women. The second section explores social spaces, including textuality itself: for every surviving medieval manuscript bespeaks collaborative effort. It considers women as authors, as anchoresses 'dead to the world', and as preachers and teachers in the world staking claims to authority without entering a pulpit. The final section considers the lives and writings of remarkable women, including Marie de France, Heloise, Joan of Arc, Julian of Norwich, Margery Kempe, and female lyricists and romancers whose names are lost, but whose texts survive.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Clerk's Tale: Young Men and Moral Life in Nineteenth-Century America   By Thomas Augst   Thousands of men left their families for the bustling cities of nineteenth-century America, where many of them found work as clerks. The Clerk's Tale recounts their remarkable story, describing the struggle of aspiring businessmen to come of age at the dawn of the modern era. How did these young men understand the volatile world of American capitalism and make sense of their place within it?    Thomas Augst follows clerks as they made their way through the boarding houses, parlors, and offices of the big city. Tracing the course of their everyday lives, Augst shows how these young men used acts of reading and writing to navigate the anonymous world of market culture and claim identities for themselves within it. Clerks, he reveals, calculated their prospects in diaries, composed detailed letters to friends and family, attended lectures by key thinkers of the day, joined libraries where they consumed fiction, all while wrestling with the boredom of their work. What results, then, is a poignant look at the literary practices of ordinary people and an affecting meditation on the moral lives of men in antebellum America.    Publisher\u2019s page           The Idea of English Ethnicity   By Robert J.C. Young   In this major contribution to debates about English identity, leading theorist Robert J.C. Young argues that Englishness was never really about England at all. In the nineteenth century, it was rather developed as a form of long-distance identity for the English diaspora around the world. Young shows how the effects of this continue to reverberate today, nationally and globally. Publisher\u2019s page           The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel   By Elaine Freedgood   While the Victorian novel famously describes, catalogs, and inundates the reader with things, the protocols for reading it have long enjoined readers not to interpret most of what crowds its pages. The Ideas in Things explores apparently inconsequential objects in popular Victorian texts to make contact with their fugitive meanings. Developing an innovative approach to analyzing nineteenth-century fiction, Elaine Freedgood here reconnects the things readers unwittingly ignore to the stories they tell.    Building her case around objects from three well-known Victorian novels\u2014the mahogany furniture in Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre, the calico curtains in Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s Mary Barton, and \u201cNegro head\u201d tobacco in Charles Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations\u2014Freedgood argues that these things are connected to histories that the novels barely acknowledge, generating darker meanings outside the novels\u2019 symbolic systems. A valuable contribution to the new field of object studies in the humanities, The Ideas in Things pushes readers\u2019 thinking about things beyond established concepts of commodity and fetish. Publisher\u2019s page           The New Asian City: Three-Dimensional Fictions of Space and Urban Form   By Jini Kim Watson     Under Jini Kim Watson\u2019s scrutiny, the Asian Tiger metropolises of Seoul,   Taipei, and Singapore reveal a surprising residue of the colonial   environment. Drawing on a wide array of literary, filmic, and political   works, and juxtaposing close readings of the built environment, Watson   demonstrates how processes of migration and construction in the   hypergrowth urbanscapes of the Pacific Rim crystallize the psychic and   political dramas of their colonized past and globalized present.   Tracing the way newly constructed spaces\u2014including expressways,   high-rises, factory zones, and department stores\u2014become figured within   cultural texts, The New Asian City explores how urban   transformations were rationalized, perceived, and fictionalized. Watson   shows how literature, film, and poetry have described and challenged   contemporary Asian metropolises, especially around the formation of   gendered and laboring subjects in these new spaces. She suggests that by   embracing the postwar growth-at-any-cost imperative, they have   buttressed the nationalist enterprise along neocolonial lines.       The New Asian City provides an innovative approach to how we   might better understand the gleaming metropolises of the Pacific Rim. In   doing so, it demonstrates how reading cultural production in   conjunction with built environments can enrich our knowledge of the   lived consequences of rapid economic and urban development. Publisher's page           The Scandal of the State: Women, Law, and Citizenship in Postcolonial India   By Rajeswari Sunder Rajan   The Scandal of the State is a revealing study of the relationship between the postcolonial, democratic Indian nation-state and Indian women\u2019s actual needs and lives. Well-known for her work combining feminist theory and postcolonial studies, Rajeswari Sunder Rajan shows how the state is central to understanding women\u2019s identities and how, reciprocally, women and \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d affect the state\u2019s role and function. She argues that in India law and citizenship define for women not only the scope of political rights but also cultural identity and everyday life. Sunder Rajan delineates the postcolonial state in implicit contrast with the \u201cenlightened,\u201d postfeminist neoliberal state in the West. Her analysis wrestles with complex social realities, taking into account the influence of age, ethnicity, religion, and class on individual and group identities as well as the shifting, heterogeneous nature of the state itself. The Scandal of the State develops through a series of compelling case studies, each of which centers around an incident exposing the contradictory position of the Indian state vis-\u00e0-vis its female citizens and, ultimately, the inadequacy of its commitment to women\u2019s rights. Sunder Rajan focuses on the custody battle over a Muslim child bride, the compulsory sterilization of mentally retarded women in state institutional care, female infanticide in Tamilnadu, prostitution as labor rather than crime, and the surrender of the female outlaw Phoolan Devi. She also looks at the ways the Uniform Civil Code presented many women with a stark choice between allegiance to their religion and community or the secular assertion of individual rights. Rich with theoretical acumen and activist passion, The Scandal of the State is a powerful critique of the mutual dependence of women and the state on one another in the specific context of a postcolonial modernity. Publisher\u2019s page           The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from The New England Primer to The Scarlet Letter   By Patricia Crain   Richly illustrated with often antic images from alphabet books and primers, The Story of A relates the history of the alphabet as a genre of text for children and of alphabetization as a social practice in America, from early modern reading primers to the literature of the American Renaissance.   Offering a poetics of alphabetization and explicating the alphabet's tropes and rhetorical strategies, the author demonstrates the far-reaching cultural power of such apparently neutral statements as \u201cA is for apple.\u201d The new market for children's books in the eighteenth century established for the \u201crepublic of ABC\u201d a cultural potency equivalent to its high-culture counterpart, the \u201crepublic of letters,\u201d while shaping its child-readers into consumers. As a central rite of socialization, alphabetization schooled children to conflicting expectations, as well as to changing models of authority, understandings of the world, and uses of literature.   In the nineteenth century, literacy became a crucial aspect of American middle-class personality and subjectivity. Furnishing the readers and writers needed for a national literature, the alphabetization of America between 1800 and 1850 informed the sentimental-reform novel as well as the self-consciously aesthetic novel of the 1850s. Through readings of conduct manuals, reading primers, and a sentimental bestseller, the author shows how the alphabet became embedded in a maternal narrative, which organized the world through domestic affections.   Nathaniel Hawthorne, by contrast, insisted on the artificiality of the alphabet and its practices in his antimimetic, hermetic The Scarlet Letter, with its insistent focus on the letter A. By understanding this novel as part of the network of alphabetization, The Story of A accounts for its uniquely persistent cultural role. The author concludes, in an epilogue, with a reading of postmodern alphabets and their implications for the future of literacy.   Publisher\u2019s page           The Work of Writing: Literature and Social Change 1700-1830   By Clifford Siskin   \"The Work of Writing is a deeply mature piece of scholarship involving dozens upon dozens of authors from all over the long eighteenth century. Not only is its sense of the 'textual' very broad, ranging from literature, to philosophy (which, Siskin argues, once occupied the disciplinary space that Literature does today), to economics and sociology, but in requiring that we wake up and think about enlightenment processes of cultural formation, it is itself exemplary of that process. Thinking very hard and on every page, it passes its own test in an exhilarating manner.\" -- Stuart Curran, University of Pennsylvania    \"The Work of Writing establishes Cliff Siskin as one of our most subtle and theoretically sophisticated scholars of Romantic cultural studies and the New Historicism. This book, breath\u2014taking in its range, documents the growing professionalisation of writing in England in the eighteenth\u2014century, as well as the ways in which both nationalist and entrepreneurial impulses worked to exclude women writers from the new category of 'professional writer' in the nineteenth century.\" -- Anne K. Mellor, University of California, Los Angeles Publisher\u2019s page           This Is Enlightenment   By Clifford Siskin (co-edited with William Warner)   Debates about the nature of the Enlightenment date to the eighteenth century, when Imanual Kant himself addressed the question, \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d The contributors to this ambitious book offer a paradigm-shifting answer to that now-famous query: Enlightenment is an event in the history of mediation. Enlightenment, they argue, needs to be engaged within the newly broad sense of mediation introduced here\u2014not only oral, visual, written, and printed media, but everything that intervenes, enables, supplements, or is simply in between. With essays addressing infrastructure and genres, associational practices and protocols, this volume establishes mediation as the condition of possibility for enlightenment. In so doing, it not only answers Kant\u2019s query; it also poses its own broader question: how would foregrounding mediation change the kinds and areas of inquiry in our own epoch? This Is Enlightenment is a landmark volume with the polemical force and archival depth to start a conversation that extends across the disciplines that the Enlightenment itself first configured. Publisher's page           Untouchable Fictions: Literary Realism and the Crisis of Caste   By Toral Jatin Gajarawala   Untouchable Fictions considers the crisis of literary realism- progressive, rural, regionalist, experimental- in order to derive a literary genealogy for the recent explosion of Dalit (\u201cuntouchable\u201d caste) fiction. Drawing on a wide array of fiction from Premchand and Renu in Hindi to Mulk Raj Anand and V.S. Naipaul in English, Gajarawala illuminates the dark side of realist complicity: a hidden aesthetics and politics of caste. How does caste color the novel? What are its formal tendencies? What generic constraints does it produce? Untouchable Fictions juxtaposes the Dalit text, and its radical critique, with a history of progressive literary movements in South Asia. Gajarawala reads Dalit writing dialectically, doing justice to its unique and groundbreaking literary interventions while also demanding that it be read as an integral moment in the literary genealogy of the 20th and 21st century. How might we trace the origins of the rise of Dalit fiction in the critical \u201crealism\u201d of the Progressive Writers Association of the 1930s, or in the gaps laid bare by the peasant novel of the 1950s? And what kind of dialogue does \u201cuntouchable caste\u201d writing with its more famous counterpart: the Anglophone fiction of the last few decades? Under Gajarawala\u2019s lens the aesthetic languages of Hindi and English are intertwined and caste becomes a central category of literary analysis. This book, grounded in the fields of postcolonial theory, South Asian literatures, and cultural studies will be important for all readers interested in the problematic relations between aesthetics and politics, between social movements and cultural production. Engaged as it is with contemporary theories of realism and the problem of aesthetics, it would also be of interest to students of English, comparative literature, contemporary Third World literature, and historians of literary movements. More specifically, as a text that considers recent developments in genre theory and South Asian fiction, it would interest scholars of the Indian and Indian Anglophone novel. Finally, this project, as an interrogation of caste politics in the cultural sphere, is an important contribution to the burgeoning field of Dalit studies. Publisher's Page           Victorian Discourses on Sexuality and Religion   By John Maynard   John Maynard's original and provocative study looks at sexuality and religion as creations of language, in the literary and cultural discourses of Victorian England. After a wide-ranging introduction (drawing on myth, anthropology, comparative religion and the history of sexuality) Maynard goes on to articulate and interpret the strikingly complex and varied ways in which the earnest sceptic Arthur Hugh Clough, the Protestant Charles Kingsley, and the Catholic convert Coventry Patmore placed the relation of sexuality and religion at the centre of their work. A final chapter on Jude the Obscure demonstrates Thomas Hardy's deconstruction of the endeavour to make sense of sexuality and religion, fragmenting this inherited discourse into mere words and bodily parts, in a disintegration of the great constructive vision of his predecessors.

Gladstein and Dara Rossman Regaignon   Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges   presents an empirical study of the writing programs at one hundred   small, private liberal arts colleges. Jill M. Gladstein and Dara Rossman   Regaignon provide detailed information about a type of writing program   not often highlighted in the scholarly record and offer a model for such   national, multi-institutional research. Utilizing the mixed methods   approach of grounded theory, Gladstein and Regaignon weave together   survey, interview, and focus group data, site document analysis, and   institutional history. They describe the writing programs at small   colleges today as being dominated by writing across the curriculum-based   approaches to writing instruction and the writing centers as   emphasizing peer tutoring, and hence the development of undergraduate   students as leaders and scholars. For small colleges, the movement   toward vertical writing curricula, professionalized leadership   positions, and innovative writing assessments occurs when institutions   deepen or reaffirm their commitment to writing across the curriculum. In   addition, Writing Program Administration at Small Liberal Arts Colleges offers a heuristic for understanding and comparing writing programs within and across institutions.

Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Wendy Suzuki Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  Power, Domination and Resistance AHSEM-UA 166 (class # 23136)  Instructor: Steven Lukes Thursday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This course will introduce students to the complexities of conceptualizing and studying power. How do we determine where it lies? Who has more and who less? How do we study its mechanisms and effects, above all in view of the intuition that it is at its most effective when least observable by both agents and observers? Is power at its most effective when most imperceptible, and, if so, how are we to study it? What are the relations between the concept of \u201cpower\u201d and such related concepts as \u201cauthority,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201cmanipulation,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cforce,\u201d and \u201cviolence\u201d? What is the relationship between so-called \u201chard\u201d and \u201csoft\u201d power? We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion. Cross-listed with Sociology as SOC-UA 935.001. This course can count towards the major in Sociology as either an advanced seminar or elective. Steven Lukes is Professor of Sociology. He studied philosophy, politics, and economics at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate, writing a thesis on Durkheim under the supervision of the anthropologist E. E. Evans-Prichard. He has previously held posts in Politics and Sociology at Balliol College, Oxford; in Political and Social Theory at the European University Institute in Florence; in Moral Philosophy at the University of Siena; and in Sociology at the London School of Economics. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and an editor of the European Journal of Sociology. His writing and teaching have ranged over political science, political and moral philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and the philosophy of the social sciences. His published works include Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work; Individualism, Marxism, and Morality ; Liberals and Cannibals: The Implications of Diversity ; The Curious Enlightenment of Professor Caritat: A Comedy of Ideas (a novel soon to be reissued); and Power: A Radical View , which recently appeared in a much-expanded second edition. He is also co-editor of Rationality and Relativism and The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History . His most recent book is Moral Relativism . What is Memory? AHSEM-UA 187 (class # 19746)  Instructor: Suzanne England Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. Cross-listed with the Silver School of Social Work as UNDSW-US 79.001. Suzanne England is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. Making History: Culture and Politics in the Caribbean AHSEM-UA 204 (class # 11940)  Instructor: Sibylle Fischer Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. In this seminar we will study the culture and politics of the Caribbean. The class is organized around key moments of Caribbean history: \u201cDiscovery;\u201d slavery and the struggles against it; colonialism and independence movements; U.S. occupations, dictatorships and revolutionary movements; the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora; and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. While the Spanish-speaking islands (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) are at the center, the French and English-speaking Caribbean (and questions that concern the Caribbean as a region), will be part of the discussion. Readings are drawn from primary sources (slave testimonies, declarations of independence, revolutionary discourses), literary texts, film, and important essays in cultural studies/critical theory, anthropology, and history. The class will be taught in English. Reading of texts in the original language is encouraged. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002 and with History as HIST-UA 760.001. Sibylle Fischer holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Spanish from Columbia University. She has held teaching positions at Duke as well as at Princeton and now teaches in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese and the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU, with affiliations with Comparative Literature and Africana Studies.

Her study of the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) and its impact on Caribbean national cultures, Modernity Disavowed , won book awards from the Modern Language Association, the Latin American Studies Association, The Caribbean Cultural Studies Association, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association. Jewish Women in Modern History AHSEM-UA 219 (class # 23214)  Instructor: Marion Kaplan Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. This course will approach Jewish women\u2019s history from the perspective of social history. After an introduction to the normative role of women in Judaism, the body of the course will focus on Jewish women in Modern Europe and America, analyzing their history in a variety of countries from the American and French Revolutions, through the bourgeois 19th century, World War I, the interwar era, the Nazi era, and postwar Europe and the United States. Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women\u2019s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women\u2019s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community.

She is co-editor of Gender and Jewish History (2010). Anthropology in the Horror Film AHSEM-UA 220 (class # 23219)  Instructor: Edward Hubbard Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. Anthropologists have appeared as protagonists and key characters in many horror films. Films like The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), Ganja and Hess (1973), Candyman (1992) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980), have pitted the anthropologist against powerful spirits and demons, accursed artifacts, mutant beasts, malevolent sorcerers and ferocious cannibals. This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure \u2013 a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition \u2013 who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries. These films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology\u2019s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 180.003 and with Dramatic Literature as DRLIT-UA 306.001.

His forthcoming publications include articles that explore black abjection in creole cultures by way of analysis of multiple forms of ethnographic data, primarily blason populaire; an experimental piece on race and the experience of the uncanny in ethnographic research; and a monograph on the globalization of acoustic batuku music in Cape Verde. Migration, Citizenship, and Belonging AHSEM-UA 221 (class # 23220)  Instructor: Arely Zimmerman Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m. New modalities of economic organization and relationships, innovations in technology and communication, and the sheer rate of growth of Latin American migration to U.S. cities has impacted the modes and practices of identity, community and membership in U.S. Latino communities. This course examines the normative and political dilemmas around issues of citizenship, belonging, and national identity amongst U.S. Latinos- brought about by immigration, transnationalism, neoliberalism, and globalization. These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership. Cross-listed with Social and Cultural Analysis as SCA-UA 541.002. Arely Zimmerman holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California (Los Angeles), with specializations in political theory and race and ethnic politics.

She is concurrently working on new research in the areas of youth, second generation Latino/a civic engagement, and new media. Empire and Decolonization AHSEM-UA 222 (class # 23573)  Instructor: Manu Goswami Thursday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. This class examines the global history of empire and decolonization, focusing on the case studies of the Spanish Empire from the nineteenth century and the British Empire in the twentieth century. These two great empires \u2013 the first running from the 15th to the 19th centuries, the second from the 18th to the 20th \u2013 are often contrasted as opposites: where the Spanish Empire is seen as the great bastion of medieval Catholicism, the British Empire is taken as Protestant and liberal. Where the first is thought of as founded through conquest and war, the second is often described as taking place through settlement and commerce. This course will question these oppositions, examining how both colonial projects of rule, and the nationalist movements that emerged against them, helped create the ideas and institutions associated with liberalism and democracy. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 569.001 . Manu Goswami is Associate Professor of History and the author of Producing India: From Colonial Economy to National Space (2004). Her research interests include nationalism and internationalism, political economy and economic thought, social theory and historical methods.

Rival Monarchies: Old Regime Spain and France AHSEM-UA 223 (class # 23574)  Instructor: Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub Wednesday, 4:55-7:35 p.m. In the memory of the history of Western Europe, the 16th century was Spanish, the 17th French, and the 18th British. The aim of this seminar is to tell the story of a 200 year duel between two archenemies: France and Spain from the Late Middle Ages to the eve of the Enlightenment. Both powers alternatively dominated during these 200 years. At the end of the period, Spain was still the most powerful European colonial empire and France the most threatening continental power upon the European soil. This is a story of wars, conquest and frontiers. The seminar will provide students with a dynamic overview of the rivalry of the two most powerful European monarchies and empires in the Early Modern Times, before the rising of the British power. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 275.001. Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Schaub teaches at the Ecole des hautes \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales (Paris).

He has been visiting professor at Yale, Michigan, Oxford, Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. He is currently preparing, with Silvia Sebastiani, a new book on the creation of racial categories in Western societies from the Late Middle Ages to the Enlightenment. He has written books on a large array of topics, such as the Jewish community in the Northern African city of Oran; the union of Spanish and Portuguese crowns in Renaissance Europe; the influence of the Spanish religious and political models on absolutist France; the historical background of Aphra Behn\u2019s novel Orroonoko or The Royal Slave ; and the challenge of writing a global history of Europe. 20th Century Music: Studies in Contemporary Opera AHSEM-UA 224 (class # 23575)  Instructor: Louis Karchin Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Prerequisite: ability to read music. This course will explore operas of the 20th and 21st centuries, beginning with works emerging from the classical tradition such as Richard Strauss\u2019 comedy Der Rosenkavalier , and continuing with the groundbreaking operas of Berg, Bartok, Britten, Stravinsky and others. The second half of the course will explore such recent innovative works as John Adam\u2019s Nixon in China , Kaija Saariaho\u2019s L\u2019amour de loin , Helmut Lachenmann\u2019s Das M\u00e4dchen mit den Schwefelh\u00f6lzern , and Gyorgy Ligeti\u2019s Le Grande Macabre . The course will focus on the interrelation of music and text, and consider subject matter as it reflects the cultural milieu of the times. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 111.001. Louis Karchin , Professor of Music at NYU, is the composer of over 70 works, including two operas. His first opera, Romulus , is available on a Naxos Records release that has garnered acclaim internationally.

Mr. Karchin has also been instrumental in new music advocacy, co-founding, mentoring, and often conducting performance ensembles such as the Orchestra of the League of Composers and the Washington Square Ensemble. He has written extensively on contemporary music topics. The Search for Authenticity AHSEM-UA 225 (class # 23681) Instructor: David Samuels Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. How should human beings sound? This is a question that has linked ideas about music to ideas about ethics for 100 years or more. The social and ethical dilemmas of two world wars and the global spread of industrial modernity created a challenge: how can we maintain our true humanity in the face of these traumas and disruptions? In this course we will explore three areas of musical life: folk music revivals, ethnomusicology, and historical performance movements. By attending to links between them, we will attempt to address questions about the role of \u201cauthenticity\u201d in musical and ethical discourse; how concerns about authenticity have colored critical responses to various musical styles and performers; and whether, in the end, authenticity is really what people have been worried about at all. Cross-listed with Music as MUSIC-UA 153.002. David Samuels is Associate Professor of Music at NYU. He is a linguistic anthropologist, folklorist, and ethnomusicologist, and received his Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas. His book Putting A Song On Top of It: Music and Identity on the San Carlos Apache Reservation (University of Arizona Press, 2004) was the first book-length monograph exploring popular music\u2019s place in the formation of contemporary Indigenous identities. His current work is focused in two main areas: how missionary encounters refigured Indigenous ideologies of language, culture, and aesthetics; and the ethical ideas suffusing various musical movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. Literature and Machines AHSEM-UA 226 (class # 24031) Instructor: Nicola Cipani Tuesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m. Machine metaphors play an important role in modern literature, conveying beliefs, anxieties, shifts, and reflections on key topics, including the nature of consciousness and creativity; the dynamics of desire and gratification; gender roles; the organization of society; the meaning of \"nature\"; and the function of technology. This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle \u00c9poque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion. Nicola Cipani is Assistant Clinical Professor at the Department of Italian Studies and has been working at NYU for ten years. His interests include reception of antiquity in medieval and early modern culture, Renaissance philosophy, the intersection of verbal/ visual forms (such as the art of memory, emblem books, and representations of dreams), and 20th-century experimental literature. At the Italian Department he has served in the capacity of Director of Language Programs (since 2005), Director of Summer Programs (2011-12), and Director of Undergraduate Studies (2011, 2013). Latin America's 1968 AHSEM-UA 229 (class # 24553)  Instructor: Jill Lane Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. In Latin America, the year 1968 marked a turning point in the social, political, and cultural transformations that had had been unfolding in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed. In this course we study the complex relations between revolution, counterculture, and authoritarian rule as they emerged in Latin America\u2019s 1968: the emergence of Brazil\u2019s Cinema Novo, Cuba\u2019s imperfect cinema, and militant documentary across the region; the rise of rock and activist nueva canci\u00f3n; and the apogee of student activism and the counterculture in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We encounter 1968 through art, music, film, fiction, journalism and news coverage, along with other primary documents from the period. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is needed for this course; students with these languages may read texts in the original. Jill Lane is Director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, and Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at NYU.

Myths, such as \u201cAll Religions Condemn Homosexuality\u201d and \u201cTransgender People Are Mentally Ill,\u201d have been used to justify discrimination and oppression of LGBT people. Others, such as \u201cHomosexuals Are Born That Way,\u201d have been embraced by LGBT communities and their allies. In discussing and dispelling these myths including gay-positive ones the authors challenge readers to question their own beliefs and to grapple with the complexities of what it means to be queer in the broadest social, political, and cultural sense. Publisher's website       Against Security: How We Go Wrong at Airports, Subways, and Other Sites of Ambiguous Danger     Harvey Molotch     Princeton University Press (August 26, 2012) Remember when an unattended package was just that, an unattended package? Remember when the airport was a place that evoked magical possibilities, not the anxiety of a full-body scan? In the post-9/11 world, we have become focused on heightened security measures, but do you feel safer? Are you safer? Against Security explains how our anxieties about public safety have translated into command-and-control procedures that annoy, intimidate, and are often counterproductive. Taking readers through varied ambiguously dangerous sites, the prominent urbanist and leading sociologist of the everyday, Harvey Molotch, argues that we can use our existing social relationships to make life safer and more humane. He begins by addressing the misguided strategy of eliminating public restrooms, which deprives us all of a basic resource and denies human dignity to those with no place else to go. Subway security instills fear through programs like \"See Something, Say Something\" and intrusive searches that have yielded nothing of value. At the airport, the security gate causes crowding and confusion, exhausting the valuable focus of TSA staff. Finally, Molotch shows how defensive sentiments have translated into the vacuous Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center site and massive error in New Orleans, both before and after Hurricane Katrina. Throughout, Molotch offers thoughtful ways of maintaining security that are not only strategic but improve the quality of life for everyone. Against Security argues that with changed policies and attitudes, redesigned equipment, and an increased reliance on our human capacity to help one another, we can be safer and maintain the pleasure and dignity of our daily lives. Publisher's website       An Ethics of Betrayal: The Politics of Otherness in Emergent U.S. Literatures and Culture     Crystal Parikh     Fordham University Press; 1 edition (April 13, 2009) In An Ethics of Betrayal , Crystal Parikh investigates the theme and tropes of betrayal and treason in Asian American and Chicano/Latino literary and cultural narratives. In considering betrayal from an ethical perspective, one grounded in the theories of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida, Parikh argues that the minority subject is obligated in a primary, preontological, and irrecusable relation of responsibility to the Other. Episodes of betrayal and treason allegorize the position of this subject, beholden to the many others who embody the alterity of existence and whose demands upon the subject result in transgressions of intimacy and loyalty. In this first major comparative study of narratives by and about Asian Americans and Latinos, Parikh considers writings by Frank Chin, Gish Jen, Chang-rae Lee, Eric Liu, Am\u00e9rico Parades, and Richard Rodriguez, as well as narratives about the persecution of Wen Ho Lee and the rescue and return of Elian Gonz\u00e1lez. By addressing the conflicts at the heart of filiality, the public dimensions of language in the constitution of minority \"community,\" and the mercenary mobilizations of \"model minority\" status, An Ethics of Betrayal seriously engages the challenges of conducting ethnic and critical race studies based on the uncompromising and unromantic ideas of justice, reciprocity, and ethical society.  Publisher's website       Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy     Nikhil Pal Singh     Harvard University Press (December 30, 2005) Despite black gains in modern America, the end of racism is not yet in sight. Nikhil Pal Singh asks what happened to the worldly and radical visions of equality that animated black intellectual activists from W. E. B. Du Bois in the 1930s to Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1960s. In so doing, he constructs an alternative history of civil rights in the twentieth century, a long civil rights era, in which radical hopes and global dreams are recognized as central to the history of black struggle. It is through the words and thought of key black intellectuals, like Du Bois, Ralph Bunche, C. L. R. James, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, and others, as well as movement activists like Malcolm X and Black Panthers, that vital new ideas emerged and circulated. Their most important achievement was to create and sustain a vibrant, black public sphere broadly critical of U.S. social, political, and civic inequality. Finding racism hidden within the universalizing tones of reform-minded liberalism at home and global democratic imperatives abroad, race radicals alienated many who saw them as dangerous and separatist. Few wanted to hear their message then, or even now, and yet, as Singh argues, their passionate skepticism about the limits of U.S. democracy remains as indispensable to a meaningful reconstruction of racial equality and universal political ideals today as it ever was.  Publisher's website       City Folk: English Country Dance and the Politics of the Folk in Modern America     Daniel J. Walkowitz     NYU Press (April 26, 2010) This is the story of English Country Dance, from its 18th century roots in the English cities and countryside, to its transatlantic leap to the U.S. in the 20th century, told by not only a renowned historian but also a folk dancer, who has both immersed himself in the rich history of the folk tradition and rehearsed its steps. In City Folk , Daniel J. Walkowitz argues that the history of country and folk dancing in America is deeply intermeshed with that of political liberalism and the \u2018old left.\u2019 He situates folk dancing within surprisingly diverse contexts, from progressive era reform, and playground and school movements, to the changes in consumer culture, and the project of a modernizing, cosmopolitan middle class society. Tracing the spread of folk dancing, with particular emphases on English Country Dance, International Folk Dance, and Contra, Walkowitz connects the history of folk dance to social and international political influences in America. Through archival research, oral histories, and ethnography of dance communities, City Folk allows dancers and dancing bodies to speak. From the norms of the first half of the century, marked strongly by Anglo-Saxon traditions, to the Cold War nationalism of the post-war era, and finally on to the counterculture movements of the 1970s, City Folk injects the riveting history of folk dance in the middle of the story of modern America. Publisher's website       Climbin' Jacob's Ladder: The Black Freedom Movement Writings of Jack O'Dell     Jack O'Dell; Editor: Nikhil Singh     University of California Press (January 18, 2010) This book collects for the first time the black freedom movement writings of Jack O'Dell and restores one of the great unsung heroes of the civil rights movement to his rightful place in the historical record. Climbin' Jacob's Ladder puts O'Dell's historically significant essays in context and reveals how he helped shape the civil rights movement. From his early years in the 1940s National Maritime Union, to his pioneering work in the early 1960s with Martin Luther King Jr., to his international efforts for the Rainbow Coalition during the 1980s, O'Dell was instrumental in the development of the intellectual vision and the institutions that underpinned several decades of anti-racist struggle. He was a member of the outlawed Communist Party in the 1950s and endured red-baiting throughout his long social justice career. This volume is edited by Nikhil Pal Singh and includes a lengthy introduction based on interviews he conducted with O'Dell on his early life and later experiences. Climbin' Jacob's Ladder provides readers with a firm grasp of the civil rights movement's left wing, which O'Dell represents, and illuminates a more radical and global account of twentieth-century US history.  Publisher's website       Creditocracy And The Case For Debt Refusal     Andrew Ross     OR Books (February 21, 2014) It   seems like pretty much everybody \u2013 homeowners, students, those who are   ill and without health insurance, and, of course, credit card holders \u2013   is up to their neck in debt that can never be repaid. 77% of US   households are seriously indebted and one in seven Americans has been   pursued by debt collectors. The major banks are bigger and more   profitable than before the 2008 crash, and legislators are all but   powerless to bring them to heel. In this forceful, eye-opening   survey, Andrew Ross contends that we are in the cruel grip of a   creditocracy \u2013 where the finance industry commandeers our elected   governments and where the citizenry have to take out loans to meet their   basic needs. The implications of mass indebtedness for any democracy   are profound, and history shows that whenever a creditor class becomes   as powerful as Wall Street, the result has been debt bondage for the   bulk of the population. Following in the ancient tradition of the   jubilee, activists have had some success in repudiating the debts of   developing countries. The time is ripe, Ross argues, for a debtors\u2019   movement to use the same kinds of moral and legal arguments to bring   relief to household debtors in the North. After examining the varieties   of lending that have contributed to the crisis, Ross suggests ways of   lifting the burden of illegitimate debts from our backs. Just as   important, Creditocracy outlines the kind of alternative economy we need   to replace a predatory debt-money system that only benefits the 1%. Publisher's website       Culture & Truth: The Remaking of Social Analysis     Renato Rosaldo     Beacon Press (August 1, 1993) Exposing the inadequacies of old conceptions of static cultures and detached observers, the book argues instead for social science to acknowledge and celebrate diversity, narrative, emotion, and subjectivity.

Michael Dash     Greenwood (October 30, 2000) Culture and Customs of Haiti begins with an overview of the mountainous island that seemed forbidding to European colonizers. Historical periods, including French colonization, U.S. occupation in the early 20th century, Independence and the Duvaliers' reigns, until today, are reviewed and provide the framework for the volume. A chapter on the people and society details the pride of the black state that managed the only successful slave revolution in history. The extremes of society from the elite to the peasantry and slum dwellers are depicted, along with Haitians in diaspora. Religion in Haiti, with the strong amalgamation of Roman Catholicism and vaudou, a West African import, is then explained. A Social Customs chapter notes the joy that is found in such an economically depressed culture. The media and literature and language chapters necessarily unfold in the context of Haiti's political history. A section on writing in Creole is especially intriguing. Finally, chapters on the performing arts and visual arts evoke the energy and color of the people in such forms as vaudou jazz and dance, contemporary rara rock, and the folkloric influence on Haitian painting. A chronology and glossary supplement the text. No publisher page available.       Culture Works: Space, Value, and Mobility Across the Neoliberal Americas     Arlene D\u00e1vila     NYU Press (April 16, 2012) Culture Works addresses and critiques an important dimension of the \u201cwork of culture,\u201d an argument made by enthusiasts of creative economies that culture contributes to the GDP, employment, social cohesion, and other forms of neoliberal development. While culture does make important contributions to national and urban economies, the incentives and benefits of participating in this economy are not distributed equally, due to restructuring that neoliberal policies have wrought from the 1980s on, as well as long-standing social structures, such as racism and classism, that breed inequality. The cultural economy promises to make life better, particularly in cities, but not everyone can take advantage of it for decent jobs. Exposing and challenging the taken-for-granted assumptions around questions of space, value and mobility that are sustained by neoliberal treatments of culture, Culture Works explores some of the hierarchies of cultural workers that these engender, as they play out in a variety of settings, from shopping malls in Puerto Rico and art galleries in New York to tango tourism in Buenos Aires. Noted scholar Arlene D\u00e1vila brilliantly reveals how similar dynamics of space, value and mobility come to bear in each location, inspiring particular cultural politics that have repercussions that are both geographically specific, but also ultimately global in scope. Publisher's website       Dark Continent of Our Bodies: Black Feminism and the Politics of Respectability     E. Frances White     Temple University Press (August 2001) In this provocative book, a black lesbian feminist looks at black feminism\u2014its roots, its role, and its implications. From Charles Darwin and nineteenth-century racism to black nationalism and the Nation of Islam, from Baptist women's groups to James Baldwin; E. Frances White takes on one institution after another as she re-centers the role of black women in the United States' intellectual heritage. White presents identity politics as a complex activity, with entangled branches of race and gender, of invisibility and voyeurism, of defiance and passivity and conformism. White's powerful introduction draws on oral narratives from her own family history to illuminate the nature of narrative, both what is said and what is left unsaid. She then sets the historical stage with a helpful history of the inception and development of black feminism and a critique of major black feminist writings. In the three chapters that follow, she addresses the obstacles black feminism has already surmounted and must continue to traverse. Confronting what White calls \"the politics of respectability,\" these chapters move the reader from simplistic views of race and gender in the nineteenth century through black nationalism and the radical movements of the sixties, and their relationship to feminist thought, to the linkages between race, gender, and sexuality in the works of such giants as Toni Morrison and James Baldwin. No one who finishes Dark Continent of Our Bodies will look at race and gender in the same way again. Publisher's website       Framing Blackness: The African American Image in Film     Ed Guerrero     Temple University Press (November 19, 1993) From D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation to Spike Lee's Malcolm X, Ed Guerrero argues, the commercial film industry reflects white domination of American society. Written with the energy and conviction generated by the new black film wave, Framing Blackness traces an ongoing epic\u2014African Americans protesting screen images of blacks as criminals, servants, comics, athletes, and sidekicks. These images persist despite blacks' irrepressible demands for emancipated images and a role in the industry. Although starkly racist portrayals of blacks in early films have gradually been replaced by more appealing characterizations, the legacy of the plantation genre lives on in Blaxpoitation films, the fantastic racialized imagery in science fiction and horror films, and the resubordination of blacks in Reagan-era films. Probing the contradictions of such images, Guerrero recalls the controversies surrounding role choices by stars like Sidney Poitier, Eddie Murphy, Whoopie Goldberg, and Richard Pryor. Throughout his study, Guerrero is attentive to the ways African Americans resist Hollywood's one-dimensional images and superficial selling of black culture as the latest fad. Organizing political demonstrations and boycotts, writing, and creating their own film images are among the forms of active resistance documented. The final chapter awakens readers to the artistic and commercial breakthrough of black independent filmmakers who are using movies to channel their rage at social injustice. Guerrero points out their diverse approaches to depicting African American life and hails innovative tactics for financing their work. Framing Blackness is the most up-to-date critical study of how African Americans are acquiring power once the province of Hollywood alone: the power of framing blackness. Publisher's website       How Soon is Now?: Medieval Texts, Amateur Readers, and the Queerness of Time     Carolyn Dinshaw     Duke University Press Books (December 14, 2012) How Soon Is Now? performs a powerful critique of modernist temporal regimes through its revelatory exploration of queer ways of being in time as well as of the potential queerness of time itself. Carolyn Dinshaw focuses on medieval tales of asynchrony and on engagements with these medieval temporal worlds by amateur readers centuries later. In doing so, she illuminates forms of desirous, embodied being that are out of sync with ordinarily linear measurements of everyday life, that involve multiple temporalities, that precipitate out of time altogether. Dinshaw claims the possibility of a fuller, denser, more crowded now that theorists tell us is extant but that often eludes our temporal grasp. Whether discussing Victorian men of letters who parodied the Book of John Mandeville , a fictionalized fourteenth-century travel narrative, or Hope Emily Allen, modern coeditor of the early-fifteenth-century Book of Margery Kempe , Dinshaw argues that these and other medievalists outside the academy inhabit different temporalities than modern professionals operating according to the clock. How Soon Is Now? clears space for amateurs, hobbyists, and dabblers who approach medieval worlds from positions of affect and attachment, from desires to build other kinds of worlds. Unruly, untimely, they urge us toward a disorderly and asynchronous collective. Publisher's website       Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation, 2nd Edition     Mary Louise Pratt     Routledge; 2 edition (November 28, 2007) Updated and expanded throughout with new illustrations and new material, this is the long-awaited second edition of a highly acclaimed and interdisciplinary book which quickly established itself as a seminal text in its field. Publisher's website       Impossible Desires: Queer Diasporas and South Asian Public Cultures     Gayatri Gopinath     Duke University Press Books (April 19, 2005) By bringing queer theory to bear on ideas of diaspora, Gayatri Gopinath produces both a more compelling queer theory and a more nuanced understanding of diaspora. Focusing on queer female diasporic subjectivity, Gopinath develops a theory of diaspora apart from the logic of blood, authenticity, and patrilineal descent that she argues invariably forms the core of conventional formulations. She examines South Asian diasporic literature, film, and music in order to suggest alternative ways of conceptualizing community and collectivity across disparate geographic locations. Her agile readings challenge nationalist ideologies by bringing to light that which has been rendered illegible or impossible within diaspora: the impure, inauthentic, and nonreproductive. Gopinath juxtaposes diverse texts to indicate the range of oppositional practices, subjectivities, and visions of collectivity that fall outside not only mainstream narratives of diaspora, colonialism, and nationalism but also most projects of liberal feminism and gay and lesbian politics and theory. She considers British Asian music of the 1990s alongside alternative media and cultural practices. Among the fictional works she discusses are V. S. Naipaul\u2019s classic novel A House for Mr. Biswas, Ismat Chughtai\u2019s short story \u201cThe Quilt,\u201d Monica Ali\u2019s Brick Lane, Shyam Selvadurai\u2019s Funny Boy, and Shani Mootoo\u2019s Cereus Blooms at Night. Analyzing films including Deepa Mehta\u2019s controversial Fire and Mira Nair\u2019s Monsoon Wedding, she pays particular attention to how South Asian diasporic feminist filmmakers have reworked Bollywood\u2019s strategies of queer representation and to what is lost or gained in this process of translation. Gopinath\u2019s readings are dazzling, and her theoretical framework transformative and far-reaching.  Publisher's website       Improvising Medicine: An African Oncology Ward in an Emerging Cancer Epidemic     Julie Livingston     Duke University Press (August 29, 2012) In Improvising Medicine , Julie Livingston tells the story of Botswana's only dedicated cancer ward, located in its capital city of Gaborone. This affecting ethnography follows patients, their relatives, and ward staff as a cancer epidemic emerged in Botswana. The epidemic is part of an ongoing surge in cancers across the global south; the stories of Botswana's oncology ward dramatize the human stakes and intellectual and institutional challenges of an epidemic that will shape the future of global health. They convey the contingencies of high-tech medicine in a hospital where vital machines are often broken, drugs go in and out of stock, and bed-space is always at a premium. They also reveal cancer as something that happens between people. Serious illness, care, pain, disfigurement, and even death emerge as deeply social experiences. Livingston describes the cancer ward in terms of the bureaucracy, vulnerability, power, biomedical science, mortality, and hope that shape contemporary experience in southern Africa. Her ethnography is a profound reflection on the social orchestration of hope and futility in an African hospital, the politics and economics of healthcare in Africa, and palliation and disfigurement across the global south. Publisher's website       Laboring Women: Reproduction and Gender in New World Slavery     Jennifer L. Morgan     University of Pennsylvania Press (February 25, 2004) When black women were brought from Africa to the New World as slave laborers, their value was determined by their ability to work as well as their potential to bear children, who by law would become the enslaved property of the mother's master. In Laboring Women: Reproduction and Gender in New World Slaver y, Jennifer L. Morgan examines for the first time how African women's labor in both senses became intertwined in the English colonies. Beginning with the ideological foundations of racial slavery in early modern Europe, Laboring Women traverses the Atlantic, exploring the social and cultural lives of women in West Africa, slaveowners' expectations for reproductive labor, and women's lives as workers and mothers under colonial slavery. Challenging conventional wisdom, Morgan reveals how expectations regarding gender and reproduction were central to racial ideologies, the organization of slave labor, and the nature of slave community and resistance. Taking into consideration the heritage of Africans prior to enslavement and the cultural logic of values and practices recreated under the duress of slavery, she examines how women's gender identity was defined by their shared experiences as agricultural laborers and mothers, and shows how, given these distinctions, their situation differed considerably from that of enslaved men. Telling her story through the arc of African women's actual lives\u2014from West Africa, to the experience of the Middle Passage, to life on the plantations\u2014she offers a thoughtful look at the ways women's reproductive experience shaped their roles in communities and helped them resist some of the more egregious effects of slave life. Presenting a highly original, theoretically grounded view of reproduction and labor as the twin pillars of female exploitation in slavery, Laboring Women is a distinctive contribution to the literature of slavery and the history of women. Publisher's website       London Calling: How Black and Asian Writers Imagined a City     Sukhdev Sandhu     HarperPerennial (November 1, 2004) London Calling tells the story of black and Asian literary London, tracing the escapades, fortune making, and self-expansion of these forgotten writers. It is a joyful and often rapturous work, a love letter to the capital, a teeming and complex mix of social and cultural history seen through the imagination and experience of great black and Asian writers. London Calling gets to the heart of the immigration impulse, and evokes the dreams and adventures of those who have sought refuge and asylum in the cradle of Empire. The book is populated by runaway slaves, lotharios, imams, boxer-pimps, rajahs and colonial revolutionaries, and discusses writers as diverse in style and time as the 18th-century grocer-aesthete Ignatius Sancho right through to Rushdie, Kureishi and yardie chronicler Victor Headley. The result is an exciting work, brimming with life, as it spotlights a rich but neglected literary tradition, and brings to life a gaping void in the city\u2019s history. Placing the multiculturalism of today\u2019s capital in its historical context, Sukhdev Sandhu shows that it is no new phenomenon, and that just as London has been the making of many black writers, they too have been the making of London. Publisher's website       New York before Chinatown: Orientalism and the Shaping of American Culture, 1776-1882     John Kuo Wei Tchen     Johns Hopkins University Press (August 22, 2001) From George Washington's desire (in the heat of the Revolutionary War) for a proper set of Chinese porcelains for afternoon tea, to the lives of Chinese-Irish couples in the 1830s, to the commercial success of Chang and Eng (the \"Siamese Twins\"), to rising fears of \"heathen Chinee,\" New York before Chinatown offers a provocative look at the role Chinese people, things, and ideas played in the fashioning of American culture and politics. Piecing together various historical fragments and anecdotes from the years before Chinatown emerged in the late 1870s, historian John Kuo Wei Tchen redraws Manhattan's historical landscape and broadens our understanding of the role of port cultures in the making of American identities. Tchen tells his story in three parts. In the first, he explores America's fascination with Asia as a source of luxury items, cultural taste, and lucrative trade. In the second, he explains how Chinese, European-Americans in Yellowface, and various caricatures became objects of curiosity in the expansive commercial marketplace. In the third part, Tchen focuses on how Americans' attitude toward the Chinese changed from fascination to demonization, leading to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Acts beginning in 1882. Publisher's website       Out of the Pits: Traders and Technology from Chicago to London     Caitlin Zaloom     University Of Chicago Press (October 15, 2010) From New York to Singapore, from Chicago to London, the trading floors of the world\u2019s financial markets are icons of global capitalism. Images of them are used on the news all the time\u2014traders burying their heads in their hands when the market is down, their arms flailing in a frenzy when fortunes are rising\u2014to convey the current state of the economy. But these marketplaces, and the cultural life that sustains them, are dissolving into the ether of the digital age: powerful financial institutions are shutting down the trading pits, replacing face-to-face exchanges with an electronic network where traders sit, face to screen, finger to mouse, and compete in a global arena made up of digits and charts. Out of the Pits considers the implications of this sea change for everyone involved, from the traders and brokers to the market as a whole. Caitlin Zaloom takes us down to the floor at the Chicago Board of Trade and into a digital dealing room in the City of London. Drawing on her own firsthand experiences as a clerk and a trader and on her unusual access to these key sites of global finance, she explains how changes at the world\u2019s leading financial exchanges have transformed economic cultures and the craft of speculation; how people and places are responding to the digital transition; how traders are remaking themselves to compete in the contemporary marketplace; and how brokers, business managers, and software designers are collaborating to build new financial markets. A penetrating and richly detailed account of how cities, culture, and technology shape everyday life in the new global economy, Out of the Pits will be must reading for business buffs or anyone who has ever wondered how financial markets work. Publisher's website       Private Affairs: Critical Ventures in the Culture of Social Relations     Phillip Brian Harper     NYU Press (June 1, 1999) In Private Affairs , Phillip Brian Harper explores the social and cultural significance of the private, proposing that, far from a universal right, privacy is limited by one's racial-and sexual-minority status. Ranging across cinema, literature, sculpture, and lived encounters\u2014from Rodin's The Kiss to Jenny Livingston's Paris is Burning\u2014 Private Affairs demonstrates how the very concept of privacy creates personal and sociopolitical hierarchies in contemporary America. Publisher's website       Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers 1840 to the Present     Deborah Willis     W. W. Norton &amp; Company (October 17, 2002) \"[N]othing less than an epic of Homeric proportions... Willis's magnificent gathering of images... rewrites American history.\" \u2014Robin D. G. Kelley Reflections in Black , the first comprehensive history of black photographers, is a groundbreaking pictorial collection of African American life. Featuring the work of undisputed masters such as James VanDerZee, Gordon Parks, and Carrie Mae Weems among dozens of others, this book is a refutation of the gross caricature of black life that many mainstream photographers have manifested by continually emphasizing poverty over family, despair over hope. Nearly 600 images offer rich, moving glimpses of everyday black life, from slavery to the Great Migration to contemporary suburban life, including rare antebellum daguerrotypes, photojournalism of the civil rights era, and multimedia portraits of middle-class families. A work so significant that it has the power to reconfigure our conception of American history itself, Reflections in Black demands to be included in every American family's library as an essential part of our heritage. A Los Angeles Times and Washington Post Book World Best Book of 2000, and a Good Morning, America best gift book of 2000. Publisher's website       Sapphic Slashers: Sex, Violence, and American Modernity     Lisa Duggan     Duke University Press Books (January 10, 2001) On a winter day in 1892, in the broad daylight of downtown Memphis, Tennessee, a middle class woman named Alice Mitchell slashed the throat of her lover, Freda Ward, killing her instantly. Local, national, and international newspapers, medical and scientific publications, and popular fiction writers all clamored to cover the ensuing \u201cgirl lovers\u201d murder trial. Lisa Duggan locates in this sensationalized event the emergence of the lesbian in U.S. mass culture and shows how newly \u201cmodern\u201d notions of normality and morality that arose from such cases still haunt and distort lesbian and gay politics to the present day. Situating this story alongside simultaneously circulating lynching narratives (and its resistant versions, such as those of Memphis antilynching activist Ida B. Wells) Duggan reveals how stories of sex and violence were crucial to the development of American modernity. While careful to point out the differences between the public reigns of terror that led to many lynchings and the rarer instances of the murder of one woman by another privately motivated woman, Duggan asserts that dominant versions of both sets of stories contributed to the marginalization of African Americans and women while solidifying a distinctly white, male, heterosexual form of American citizenship. Having explored the role of turn-of-the-century print media\u2014and in particular their tendency toward sensationalism\u2014Duggan moves next to a review of sexology literature and to novels, most notably Radclyffe Hall\u2019s The Well of Loneliness. Sapphic Slashers concludes with two appendices, one of which presents a detailed summary of Ward\u2019s murder, the trial, and Mitchell\u2019s eventual institutionalization. The other presents transcriptions of letters exchanged between the two women prior to the crime. Combining cultural history, feminist and queer theory, narrative analysis, and compelling storytelling, Sapphic Slashers provides the first history of the emergence of the lesbian in twentieth-century mass culture. Publisher's website       Selling the Race: Culture, Community, and Black Chicago, 1940-1955     Adam Green     University Of Chicago Press (November 15, 2006) In Selling the Race , Adam Green tells the story of how black Chicagoans were at the center of a national movement in the 1940s and \u201950s, a time when African Americans across the country first started to see themselves as part of a single culture. Along the way, he offers fascinating reinterpretations of such events as the 1940 American Negro Exposition, the rise of black music and the culture industry that emerged around it, the development of the Associated Negro Press and the founding of Johnson Publishing, and the outcry over the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till. By presenting African Americans as agents, rather than casualties, of modernity, Green ultimately reenvisions urban existence in a way that will resonate with anyone interested in race, culture, or the life of cities.

Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market     Walter Johnson     Harvard University Press (April 1, 2001) Soul by Soul tells the story of slavery in antebellum America by moving away from the cotton plantations and into the slave market itself, the heart of the domestic slave trade. Taking us inside the New Orleans slave market, the largest in the nation, where 100,000 men, women, and children were packaged, priced, and sold, Walter Johnson transforms the statistics of this chilling trade into the human drama of traders, buyers, and slaves, negotiating sales that would alter the life of each. What emerges is not only the brutal economics of trading but the vast and surprising interdependencies among the actors involved. Using recently discovered court records, slaveholders\u2019 letters, nineteenth-century narratives of former slaves, and the financial documentation of the trade itself, Johnson reveals the tenuous shifts of power that occurred in the market\u2019s slave coffles and showrooms. Traders packaged their slaves by \u201cfeeding them up,\u201d dressing them well, and oiling their bodies, but they ultimately relied on the slaves to play their part as valuable commodities. Slave buyers stripped the slaves and questioned their pasts, seeking more honest answers than they could get from the traders. In turn, these examinations provided information that the slaves could utilize, sometimes even shaping a sale to their own advantage. Johnson depicts the subtle interrelation of capitalism, paternalism, class consciousness, racism, and resistance in the slave market, to help us understand the centrality of the \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d in the lives of slaves and slaveholders alike. His pioneering history is in no small measure the story of antebellum slavery. Publisher's website **No longer a Professor at NYU       The Beautiful Generation: Asian Americans and the Cultural Economy of Fashion     Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu     Duke University Press Books (December 21, 2010) Since the 1990s, young Asian Americans including Doo-Ri Chung, Derek Lam, Thakoon Panichgul, Alexander Wang, and Jason Wu have emerged as leading fashion designers. They have won prestigious awards, been chosen to head major clothing labels, and had their designs featured in Vogue, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, and other fashion magazines. At the same time that these designers were rising to prominence, the fashion world was embracing Asian chic. During the 1990s, \u201cAsian\u201d shapes, fabrics, iconography, and colors filled couture runways and mass-market clothing racks. In The Beautiful Generation, Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu explores the role of Asian American designers in New York\u2019s fashion industry, paying particular attention to how they relate to the garment workers who produce their goods and to Asianness as a fashionable commodity. She draws on conversations with design students, fashion curators, and fashion publicists; interviews with nearly thirty Asian American designers who have their own labels; and time spent with those designers in their shops and studios, on their factory visits, and at their fashion shows. The Beautiful Generation links the rise of Asian American designers to historical patterns of immigration, racial formation, and globalized labor, and to familial and family-like connections between designers and garment workers. Publisher's website       The Day of Shelly's Death: The Poetry and Ethnography of Grief     Renato Rosaldo     Duke University Press Books (November 27, 2013) This deeply moving collection of poetry by Renato Rosaldo focuses on the shock of his wife Michelle (Shelly) Rosaldo's sudden death on October 11, 1981. Just the day before, Shelly and her family had arrived in the northern Philippine village of Mungayang, where she and her husband Renato, both accomplished anthropologists, planned to conduct fieldwork. On October 11, Shelly died after losing her footing and falling some sixty feet from a cliff into a swollen river. Renato Rosaldo explored the relationship between bereavement and rage in his canonical essay, \"Grief and a Headhunter's Rage,\" which first appeared in 1984 and is reprinted here. In the poems at the heart of this book, he returns to the trauma of Shelly's death through the medium of free verse, maintaining a tight focus on the events of October 11, 1981. He explores not only his own experience of Shelly's death but also the imagined perspectives of many others whose lives intersected with that tragic event and its immediate aftermath, from Shelly herself to the cliff from which she fell, from the two young boys who lost their mother to the strangers who carried and cared for them, from a tricycle taxi driver, to a soldier, to priests and nuns. Photographs taken years earlier, when Renato and Shelly were conducting research across the river valley from Mungayang, add a stark beauty. In a new essay, \"Notes on Poetry and Ethnography,\" Rosaldo explains how and why he came to write the harrowing yet beautiful poems in The Day of Shelly's Death. More than anything else though, the essay is a manifesto in support of what he calls antropoes\u00eda, verse with an ethnographic sensibility. The essay clarifies how this book of rare humanity and insight challenges the limits of ethnography as it is usually practiced. Publisher's website       The Diaspora Strikes Back: Caribeno Tales of Learning and Turning     Juan Flores     Routledge (June 30, 2007) In The Diaspora Strikes Back the eminent ethnic and cultural studies scholar Juan Flores flips the process on its head: what happens to the home country when it is being constantly fed by emigrants returning from abroad? He looks at how 'Nuyoricans' (Puerto Rican New Yorkers) have transformed the home country, introducing hip hop and modern New York culture to the Caribbean island. While he focuses on New York and Mayaguez (in Puerto Rico), the model is broadly applicable. Indians introducing contemporary British culture to India; New York Dominicans bringing slices of New York culture back to the Dominican Republic; Mexicans bringing LA culture (from fast food to heavy metal) back to Guadalajara and Monterrey. This ongoing process is both massive and global, and Flores' novel account will command a significant audience across disciplines. No publisher website available for this book.       The Revolutionary Imagination in the Americas and the Age of Development     Maria Josefina Saldana-Portillo     Duke University Press Books (November 7, 2003) In The Revolutionary Imagination in the Americas and the Age of Developmen t, Mar\u00eda Josefina Salda\u00f1a-Portillo boldly argues that crucial twentieth-century revolutionary challenges to colonialism and capitalism in the Americas have failed to resist\u2014and in fact have been constitutively related to\u2014the very developmentalist narratives that have justified and naturalized postwar capitalism. Salda\u00f1a-Portillo brings the critique of development discourse to bear on such exemplars of revolutionary and resistant political thought and practice as Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara, Malcolm X, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, and the Guatemalan guerrilla resistance. She suggests that for each of these, developmentalist constructions frame the struggle as a heroic movement from unconsciousness to consciousness, from a childlike backwardness toward a disciplined and self-aware maturity. Reading governmental reports, memos, and policies, Salda\u00f1a-Portillo traces the arc of development narratives from its beginnings in the 1944 Bretton Woods conference through its apex during Robert S. McNamara's reign at the World Bank (1968\u20131981). She compares these narratives with models of subjectivity and agency embedded in the autobiographical texts of three revolutionary icons of the 1960s and 1970s\u2014those of Che Guevara, Guatemalan insurgent Mario Payeras, and Malcolm X\u2014and the agricultural policy of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Salda\u00f1a-Portillo highlights a shared paradigm of a masculinist transformation of the individual requiring the \"transcendence\" of ethnic particularity for the good of the nation. While she argues that this model of progress often alienated the very communities targeted by the revolutionaries, she shows how contemporary insurgents such as Rigoberta Mench\u00fa, the Zapatista movement, and queer Aztl\u00e1n have taken up the radicalism of their predecessors to retheorize revolutionary subjectivity for the twenty-first century. Publisher's website       The Trouble With Unity: Latino Politics and the Creation of Identity     Cristina Beltr\u00e1n     Oxford University Press (September 27, 2010) Over the past decade, much attention has been given to examining the growing political influence of Latinos in the United States in order to define the so-called \"Latino vote.\" The existence of a coherent, pan-ethnic Latino political agenda is, as this book shows, not only highly debatable, but democratically unviable. Situated at the intersection of political theory and Latino studies, The Trouble with Unity is a nuanced critique of civic Latinidad and the Latino electoral and protest politics that work to erase diversity and debate in favor of images of commonality. Cristina Beltr\u00e1n looks at key moments in U.S. Latino political history through the lens of political, feminist, and cultural thought to provide a theoretically driven account of the many ways in which Latinos lay claim to the public realm. In its innovative approach to the realities of Latino protest politics, The Trouble with Unity advances both social movement and democratic political theory. Publisher's website       The Twilight of Equality: Neoliberalism, Cultural Politics, and the Attack on Democracy     Lisa Duggan     Beacon Press (October 11, 2004) By now, we've all heard about the shocking redistribution of wealth that's occurred during the last thirty years, and particularly during the last decade. But economic changes like this don't occur in a vacuum; they're always linked to politics. The Twilight of Equality ? searches out these links through an analysis of the politics of the 1990s, the decade when neoliberalism-free market economics-became gospel. After a brilliant historical examination of how racial and gender inequities were woven into the very theoretical underpinnings of the neoliberal model of the state, Duggan shows how these inequities play out today. In a series of political case studies, Duggan reveals how neoliberal goals have been pursued, demonstrating that progressive arguments that separate identity politics and economic policy, cultural politics and affairs of state, can only fail. Ultimately, The Twilight of Equality? not only reveals how the highly successful rhetorical maneuvers of neoliberalism have functioned but, more importantly, it shows a way to revitalize and unify progressive politics in the U.S. today. Publisher's website       Theatre and Postcolonial Desires     Awam Amkpa     Routledge (December 3, 2003) This book explores the themes of colonial encounters and postcolonial contests over identity, power and culture through the prism of theatre. The struggles it describes unfolded in two cultural settings separated by geography, but bound by history in a common web of colonial relations spun by the imperatives of European modernity. In post-imperial England, as in its former colony Nigeria, the colonial experience not only hybridized the process of national self-definition, but also provided dramatists with the language, imagery and frame of reference to narrate the dynamics of internal wars over culture and national destiny happening within their own societies. The author examines the works of prominent twentieth-century Nigerian and English dramatists such as Wole Soyinka, Femi Osofisan, Davd Edgar and Caryl Churchill to argue that dramaturgies of resistance in the contexts of both Nigerian as well as its imperial inventor England, shared a common allegiance to what he describes as postcolonial desires. That is, the aspiration to overcome the legacies of colonialism by imagining alternative universes anchored in democratic cultural pluralism. The plays and their histories serve as filters through which Ampka illustrates the operation of what he calls 'overlapping modernities' and reconfigures the notions of power and representation, citizenship and subjectivity, colonial and anticolonial nationalisms and postcoloniality. The dramatic works studied in this book embodied a version of postcolonial aspirations that the author conceptualises as transcending temporal locations to encompass varied moments of consciousness for progressive change, whether they happened during the hey day of English imperialism in early twentieth-century Nigeria, or in response to the exclusionary politics of the Conservative Party in Thatcherite England. Theatre and Postcolonial Desires will be essential reading for students and researchers in the areas of drama, postcolonial and cultural studies. No publisher website available for this book.       Unhitched: Love, Marriage, and Family Values from West Hollywood to Western China     Judith Stacey     NYU Press (April 1, 2012) A leading expert on the family, Judith Stacey is known for her provocative research on mainstream issues. Finding herself impatient with increasingly calcified positions taken in the interminable wars over same-sex marriage, divorce, fatherlessness, marital fidelity, and the like, she struck out to profile unfamiliar cultures of contemporary love, marriage, and family values from around the world. Built on bracing original research that spans gay men\u2019s intimacies and parenting in America to plural and non-marital forms of family in South Africa and China, Unhitched decouples the taken for granted relationships between love, marriage, and parenthood. Countering the one-size-fits-all vision of family values, Stacey offers readers a lively, in-person introduction to these less familiar varieties of intimacy and family and to the social, political, and economic conditions that buttress and batter them. Through compelling stories of real families navigating inescapable personal and political trade-offs between desire and domesticity, the book undermines popular convictions about family, gender, and sexuality held on the left, right, and center. Taking on prejudices of both conservatives and feminists, Unhitched poses a powerful empirical challenge to the belief that the nuclear family\u2014whether straight or gay\u2014is the single, best way to meet our needs for intimacy and care. Stacey calls on citizens and policy-makers to make their peace with the fact that family diversity is here to stay.  Publisher's website       Where Stuff Comes From: How Toasters, Toilets, Cars, Computers and Many Other Things Come To Be As They Are     Harvey Molotch     Routledge (February 6, 2005) Molotch takes us on a fascinating exploration into the worlds of technology, design, corporate and popular culture. We now see how corporations, designers, retailers, advertisers, and other middle-men influence what a thing can be and how it is made. We see the way goods link into ordinary life as well as vast systems of consumption, economic and political operation. The book is a meditation into the meaning of the stuff in our lives and what that stuff says about us. No publisher website available.       Yellow Peril!: An Archive of Anti-Asian Fear     John Kuo Wei Tchen and Dylan Yeats     Verso (February 11, 2014) The \u201cyellow peril\u201d is one of the oldest and most pervasive racist ideas   in Western culture\u2014dating back to the birth of European colonialism   during the Enlightenment. Yet while Fu Manchu looks almost quaint today,   the prejudices that gave him life persist in modern culture. Yellow   Peril! is the first comprehensive repository of anti-Asian images and   writing, and it surveys the extent of this iniquitous form of paranoia. Written   by two dedicated scholars and replete with paintings, photographs, and   images drawn from pulp novels, posters, comics, theatrical productions,   movies, propagandistic and pseudo-scholarly literature, and a varied   world of pop culture ephemera, this is both a unique and fascinating   archive and a modern analysis of this crucial historical formation.
