The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Science degree from the Polytechnic Institute of NYU. Students with this combination of degrees are likely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual-degree combination are as follows: \u2022 B.S. in biology/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in chemistry/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in mechanical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in mechanical engineering Students in the program complete all of the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) requirements, with the exception of the foreign language requirement, from which they are excused. (Their required math and science courses automatically satisfy the MAP\u2019s Foundations of Scientific Inquiry requirements.) There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit can typically lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Tyrell Davis, the adviser for all students in the various programs. He may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Application materials for this dual-degree program may be requested from New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. REQUIREMENTS The dual-degree program is designed to meet the educational and career interests of students with strong qualifications, as evidenced by their GPA in high school and by their performance in mathematics and science. Students who rank near the top of their class and who have done well on standardized tests, particularly in mathematics, are especially well suited.  Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program, including mathematics (through trigonometry), chemistry, and physics and exhibited substantial extracurricular activity and leadership. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and must be prepared to begin with Calculus I (V63.0121) in the first semester of college. Given the highly structured curricula, transfer into the program after the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion in order to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee. THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of study in the College of Arts and Science at New York University. In the first year at the College, the different curricula call for many of the same courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty at both schools before committing themselves to a particular science/engineering major.                                      During Freshman Orientation, if they have not already done so, students select a major area for their study at New York University from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. In their first year, students will have the opportunity to change this major and to reflect on their choice of an engineering major. In the spring of the third year, an orientation program helps students prepare for the transition to Poly in the fourth year. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their MAP requirements and also take some of the Poly courses required for their choice of engineering major. Students may elect to withdraw from the dual-degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science general and major requirements at New York University. The final two years of study are undertaken at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway ride from New York University\u2019s Greenwich Village campus.                      At Poly, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the NYU-Poly dual-degree program include chemical and biolmolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.

The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts experience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon completion of this five-year program, students receive the Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Arts and Science at New York University and the Bachelor of Science degree from the Polytechnic Institute of NYU. Students with this combination of degrees are likely to find excellent employment opportunities. The available dual-degree combination are as follows: \u2022 B.S. in biology/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in chemistry/B.S. in chemical and biomolecular engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in computer science/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in mathematics/B.S. in mechanical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in civil engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in computer engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in electrical engineering \u2022 B.S. in physics/B.S. in mechanical engineering Students in the program complete all of the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) requirements, with the exception of the foreign language requirement, from which they are excused. (Their required math and science courses automatically satisfy the MAP\u2019s Foundations of Scientific Inquiry requirements.) There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit can typically lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the curricula are available from Tyrell Davis, the adviser for all students in the various programs. He may be contacted at the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Application materials for this dual-degree program may be requested from New York University, Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339. REQUIREMENTS The dual-degree program is designed to meet the educational and career interests of students with strong qualifications, as evidenced by their GPA in high school and by their performance in mathematics and science. Students who rank near the top of their class and who have done well on standardized tests, particularly in mathematics, are especially well suited.  Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program, including mathematics (through trigonometry), chemistry, and physics and exhibited substantial extracurricular activity and leadership. Students are usually admitted to the program as freshmen and must be prepared to begin with Calculus I (V63.0121) in the first semester of college. Given the highly structured curricula, transfer into the program after the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion in order to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee. THE PROGRAM Students accepted into the program spend their first three years of study in the College of Arts and Science at New York University. In the first year at the College, the different curricula call for many of the same courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty at both schools before committing themselves to a particular science/engineering major.                                      During Freshman Orientation, if they have not already done so, students select a major area for their study at New York University from the disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. In their first year, students will have the opportunity to change this major and to reflect on their choice of an engineering major. In the spring of the third year, an orientation program helps students prepare for the transition to Poly in the fourth year. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their MAP requirements and also take some of the Poly courses required for their choice of engineering major. Students may elect to withdraw from the dual-degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science general and major requirements at New York University. The final two years of study are undertaken at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway ride from New York University\u2019s Greenwich Village campus.                      At Poly, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the NYU-Poly dual-degree program include chemical and biolmolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.

Minors   You can choose to enhance your undergraduate degree with a minor that can be seamlessly integrated into your BS in Mechanical Engineering program:   Minor in Aerospace Engineering   Moon and planetary vehicles, deep-space probes and space habitats, once confined to the realm of science fiction, are now realities. Vehicles under design or projected for the future in aircraft, spacecraft, and other airborne and space-related devices and systems challenge the imagination. They also challenge the current knowledge base and state of the art of the technologies involved. The scientific aspects of aircraft and spacecraft design are rooted in mechanical engineering. The Minor in Aerospace Engineering prepares students to push the boundaries of knowledge, lead teams of specialists to achieve mission-specific goals, and follow successful careers in aerospace related industries.   Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear Science and Engineering   The Nuclear Engineering field is experiencing a major resurgence from the skeptical public attitude of the 1970s and 1980s that resulted in a stagnated nuclear power industry for more than 2 decades. At the same time nuclear technologies have emerged in many fields to provide advanced solutions to challenging problems, such as food processing, instrumentation, diagnostics, and perhaps most importantly in the medical industry where many nuclear-based diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have saved and improved the lives of millions. In addition, growing concerns regarding global warming have again shifted the attitude of the public to a more favorable view of the potential benefits of carbon-free nuclear power.   To meet the demands of this resurgent industry, engineers proficient in the fundamentals of the nuclear sciences and engineering are needed. The Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear Sciences and Engineering, which is offered in collaboration with the Department of Applied Physics, prepares graduates for rewarding and successful careers in nuclear sciences and engineering related fields.
