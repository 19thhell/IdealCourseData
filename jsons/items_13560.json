The taken-for-granted world is invisible except under special   conditions--when boredom is induced by the sheer repetitiveness of the banal   or when poesis transforms the utterly ordinary or when the shock of the sensational,   spectacular, or exotic calls the taken-for-granted into question.   Debates over the creative and emancipatory potential of vernacular   culture will move us towards a critical theory of everyday life. A close reading   of key thinkers such as de Certeau, Williams, Hall, and Harvey will frame our   fine-grained analyses of the urban mise-en-scene in New York City, its spatial   and temporal organization, its concentrations of power and oppositional practices,   its performative modes and values.   We will examine the phantasmagoria of New York city streets and   open spaces (Washington Square, Times Square); the vernacular imprint on the   built environment (graffiti, sidewalk altars, casitas, vendors, Christmas lights);   the festivalizing of the city (Easter Parade, and Hasidic Purim in Brooklyn);   home and homelessness; death in the vernacular, including memorial walls in   various New York City neighborhoods, and the role of tourism, museums, and performance   artists in constituting the quotidian. We will also consider technology in everyday   life, particularly the social worlds emerging in cyberspace. Where possible,   fieldtrips will be organized to relevant events and parts of the city.     Research Essay   Examine in depth a cultural setting or event in New York. Focus   on one of the issues raised in the course. Photography and video/sound recording   are strongly encouraged. Essays based on fieldwork are strongly encouraged..   Historical research using primary sources is also appropriate. Essays should   combine thick description with analysis that addresses theoretical issues raised   in the course. Mechanics of the paper must be under control--copyediting, proofreading,   consistent formatting of footnotes and bibliography. Students are encouraged   to use this assignment as a pilot project for the masters essay or doctoral   dissertation, and to think in terms of presenting this work at the October 2000   meetings of the American Folklore Society meetings in Anchorage, Alaska (deadlines   for submissions are fast approaching), November 2000 meetings of the American   Studies Association, and April 2001 PSi Conference in Munich, among others.   Collaborative projects are strongly encouraged. Due Wednesday   April 26 .   Research Essay Proposal   We will discuss project ideas in class and in the class newsgroup.   In addition, you are encouraged to brainstorm ideas with me during office hours   and by email. The topic should be settled and you should already have begun   working on it when you submit the proposal. The proposal (2-3 pages, double-spaced)   should demonstrate a good match between the case you will analyze and the conceptual   focus and theoretical orientation you will use. Show how you will gain access   to your subject and explain what you have already done by way of preparation.   List the relevant reading, indictating what you have already read. Provide a   provisional outline for the paper. Or, alternatively, treat this proposal like   you would the long abstract that you are asked to submit when you volunteer   a paper for a conference.

Her dissertation, The Comedy of Revolution: Ludic Critique, Everyday Life and Narratives of the Nation-State in Egypt and Cuba, 1960s-1990 s, explores the critical roles played by the comic and ludic as means of engaging with and complicating official discourse and in the process bypassing the constraints of state censorship. Her comparative reading of post 1945 Arabic and Latin American literature began with her master's thesis, Pablo Neruda and Sa'di Yusuf: Between Aesthetics and Ideology , examines the manner through which Neruda and Yusuf weaved their communist political beliefs with aesthetic experimentation and innovation to incorporate the quotidian into the realm of the poetic. In addition to her comparative research, she has special interest in the cultural production of the Arab Nahda, especially its travelogues and literary journalism. She is currently exploring this interest through her research on Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, one of the first Arab novelists and the owner and editor of the first independent Arabic publishing house and newspaper.

This course examines 20th-century narratives that exemplify and explore the modernist and postmodernist paranoid mindset. Authors include Kafka, Olesha, Freud, Pelevin, Pynchon, Dick, and Sologub.

The novel has been for a long time understood by its theorists as the genre par excellence of truthlessness. This course attempts to reevaluate this view, proposing that the 19th-century novel in particular should be understood as responding to the emerging tendency to view truth as inseparable from, rather than opposed to, time. This tendency, then, can be said to account for the specific shape and the remarkable \"success\" of the 19th-century European novel. It is in these novels that narrative's essential relation to time achieves its most dramatic fruition. Readings from Goethe, Hegel, Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Henry James, Bakhtin, Koj\u00e8ve, Peter Brooks.    The Bildungsroman in Russia and the West    RUSSN-GA 2126 Kliger. 4 points. 2013-14. Explores the generic field of the Bildungsroman as it organizes a number of representative narratives in 19th-century Russia and Western Europe in light of modernity's paradoxical injunctions toward rigorous socialization on the one hand and subjective volatilization on the other.

The taken-for-granted world is invisible except under special   conditions--when boredom is induced by the sheer repetitiveness of the banal   or when poesis transforms the utterly ordinary or when the shock of the sensational,   spectacular, or exotic calls the taken-for-granted into question.   Debates over the creative and emancipatory potential of vernacular   culture will move us towards a critical theory of everyday life. A close reading   of key thinkers such as de Certeau, Williams, Hall, and Harvey will frame our   fine-grained analyses of the urban mise-en-scene in New York City, its spatial   and temporal organization, its concentrations of power and oppositional practices,   its performative modes and values.   We will examine the phantasmagoria of New York city streets and   open spaces (Washington Square, Times Square); the vernacular imprint on the   built environment (graffiti, sidewalk altars, casitas, vendors, Christmas lights);   the festivalizing of the city (Easter Parade, and Hasidic Purim in Brooklyn);   home and homelessness; death in the vernacular, including memorial walls in   various New York City neighborhoods, and the role of tourism, museums, and performance   artists in constituting the quotidian. We will also consider technology in everyday   life, particularly the social worlds emerging in cyberspace. Where possible,   fieldtrips will be organized to relevant events and parts of the city.     Research Essay   Examine in depth a cultural setting or event in New York. Focus   on one of the issues raised in the course. Photography and video/sound recording   are strongly encouraged. Essays based on fieldwork are strongly encouraged..   Historical research using primary sources is also appropriate. Essays should   combine thick description with analysis that addresses theoretical issues raised   in the course. Mechanics of the paper must be under control--copyediting, proofreading,   consistent formatting of footnotes and bibliography. Students are encouraged   to use this assignment as a pilot project for the masters essay or doctoral   dissertation, and to think in terms of presenting this work at the October 2000   meetings of the American Folklore Society meetings in Anchorage, Alaska (deadlines   for submissions are fast approaching), November 2000 meetings of the American   Studies Association, and April 2001 PSi Conference in Munich, among others.   Collaborative projects are strongly encouraged. Due Wednesday   April 26 .   Research Essay Proposal   We will discuss project ideas in class and in the class newsgroup.   In addition, you are encouraged to brainstorm ideas with me during office hours   and by email. The topic should be settled and you should already have begun   working on it when you submit the proposal. The proposal (2-3 pages, double-spaced)   should demonstrate a good match between the case you will analyze and the conceptual   focus and theoretical orientation you will use. Show how you will gain access   to your subject and explain what you have already done by way of preparation.   List the relevant reading, indictating what you have already read. Provide a   provisional outline for the paper. Or, alternatively, treat this proposal like   you would the long abstract that you are asked to submit when you volunteer   a paper for a conference. During the course of the semester, you are encouraged   to submit working outlines of the paper as a basis for getting feedback as the   project develops. Due Monday February 21 .   Oral Report   On Sunday April 30 we will   devote the entire day to a symposium during which each person will report orally   on their research project. These reports will be formal conference presentations--5   minutes (2 1/2 typed pages) in length--and will also be handed in. This will   be the last day of class.     Conference Program   Conference Protocol     Final Portfolio   Final portfolio is to be submitted with the research essay on    Sunday April 30. . The portfolio is to include   all the work done for the course, including reading responses, fieldwork reports,   research essay, and introductory statement that orients the reader to the work   presented in the portfolio.     Field Trips   Fieldtrips are planned in connection such events as Chinese New   Year, Purim, St. Patrick's Day, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday, among others.   The requirement for the course is that you attend as least TWO, and write brief   reports on each. You are encouraged to attend as many as you can.   Field Reports   Submit a brief (3 page double-spaced) field report at the beginning   of the class following each of the two fieldtrips you attend. Each report should   be structured around an observational focus that you decide upon before the   field trip, with the help of preparatory class discussion. Class discussion   will be based on these reports.     Readings   Readings will be available online, in the Performance Studies   Archive, at Bobst, and at the NYU Book Center. Weekly reading assignments must   be completed before the class for which they are assigned. You will be expected   to relate ideas in the readings to class presentations and discussion and to   use them in your field reports and research project.

Her dissertation, The Comedy of Revolution: Ludic Critique, Everyday Life and Narratives of the Nation-State in Egypt and Cuba, 1960s-1990 s, explores the critical roles played by the comic and ludic as means of engaging with and complicating official discourse and in the process bypassing the constraints of state censorship. Her comparative reading of post 1945 Arabic and Latin American literature began with her master's thesis, Pablo Neruda and Sa'di Yusuf: Between Aesthetics and Ideology , examines the manner through which Neruda and Yusuf weaved their communist political beliefs with aesthetic experimentation and innovation to incorporate the quotidian into the realm of the poetic. In addition to her comparative research, she has special interest in the cultural production of the Arab Nahda, especially its travelogues and literary journalism. She is currently exploring this interest through her research on Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, one of the first Arab novelists and the owner and editor of the first independent Arabic publishing house and newspaper.

Conspiracy Theories: Paranoid Fictions After Freud    RUSSN-GA 2122 Borenstein. 4 points. 2013-14.

The novel has been for a long time understood by its theorists as the genre par excellence of truthlessness. This course attempts to reevaluate this view, proposing that the 19th-century novel in particular should be understood as responding to the emerging tendency to view truth as inseparable from, rather than opposed to, time. This tendency, then, can be said to account for the specific shape and the remarkable \"success\" of the 19th-century European novel. It is in these novels that narrative's essential relation to time achieves its most dramatic fruition. Readings from Goethe, Hegel, Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Henry James, Bakhtin, Koj\u00e8ve, Peter Brooks.
