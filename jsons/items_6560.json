However, in the  1960's and 70's with the coinciding civil rights movement and womens rights  movement, abortion became the new national issue we still see today between two  opposing ideologies, grouped into sides coined as pro-life and pro-choice. It  is this struggle over whose deep rooted morals and beliefs are adequate for our  society that make the abortion issue such a controversial and divisive one.  First it is important to understand each side, their beliefs, the organizations  tied to them, and their wishes for policies in our nation. Then it may be possible to take a course of  action that will benefit the American public as a whole. We must look at the  evolving nature of abortion throughout history, each significant issue in  conflict between each side, the profiles of the people within the group, as  well as relevant statistics that provide empirical evidence to the research. It  is then with this analysis that the foundation for a well-structured abortion  policy best suited for America can be enacted.                        While  it may seem that abortion has always been an issue, it really only became one  in the middle of the 19 th century. In the early1800s, abortions were  permitted in the United States if they were done before the mother could feel  fetal movement   [1]  .  Abortions were for the most part morally accepted at the time, but a number of  state laws limiting abortion were soon passed due to an effort by medically  trained doctors to put illegal doctors out of business who practiced without  any formal training. By opposing abortions on moral and scientific grounds, the  formal doctors were lacking in what the untrained doctors provided, and  therefore, formal doctors had an incentive to attempt to ban abortion. Prior to  1847 though, the doctors were mostly unsuccessful in their ban as they could  not rally much support for their cause; even organized religion seemed  disinterested.  [2]          In  1847, the American Medical Association (AMA) was founded, and through this  group, the doctors were able to conduct a hard-hitting campaign. With the help  of the anti-obscenity movement and the Comstock Laws, which banned the  distribution of birth control related materials, as well as the fear of a  declination of the white population and increased birth rate of immigrants, the  anti-abortion campaign was successful. All states passed comprehensive criminal  abortion laws by the end of the 19 th century.   [3]        Because  of the rise in illegal abortions during the Great depression, doctors, social  workers, and professionals alike made initial actions for reform of the  abortion laws in the 1950s. They believed that under certain circumstances  abortions were justified, and a doctors inability to perform them was seen as  a harp on their own medical jurisdiction. Doctors discussed abortion as an act  of desperation by women who did not deserve to die in a back alley and who  should be dealt with more humanely.   [4]    Further into the 1960s, as a response to incidents of a rubella measles  epidemic causing fetal deformity, and the consumption by one Sherri Finkbine of  a drug thalidomide which also caused fetal deformity, the abortion issue hit  the media spotlight. The Zero Population Growth Movement and the Womens  Movement also raised abortion issues and generated greater action. The Womens  Movement of the 1960s saw many reform and repeal groups form, including the  National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL) in 1969, and the  rise of civil liberties groups and family planning activists. It was during the  revolutionary 1960s when abortions definition was widely accepted among  pro-choice people as a womens right necessary for womens control of  their own bodies.   [5]        The  abortion issue continued to grow when in 1973, the Supreme Court overturned a  Texas interpretation of abortion laws and made abortion legal in the United  States in Roe v. Wade. Based primarily upon the Constitutions Ninth Amendment  protecting a persons right to privacy, the decision held that a woman has the  right to an unrestricted choice of abortion in the first trimester of  pregnancy, that the state has the right to regulate abortion in the second  trimester, and that in the third trimester, abortion should be performed only  to save the life of the woman.  [6]    From this point on, the fight between pro-choice activists, who seemed to  have won in the case of Roe V. Wade, and pro-life activists, who were more  rallied to action than ever before, exploded with passionate  and oftentimes violent enthusiasm that remains constant to this day.       PROFILES:       Taking a look at the demographic profiles of the women who  actually have abortions will give us an idea of who are these people are in the  nation, enabling us to make better judgments about what direction the nation is  heading in this issue.       1.) Pro-life Profile:       Pro-life advocates  vehemently oppose abortion. They believe  there is no justification for it and current laws should be changed to declare  it an illegal practice. Some pro-life  groups and organizations include the National Right to Life (NRL), Prolife America  and the Pro-Life Action League. All  these groups and their members share the same beliefs and goals, and they  usually utilize the same arguments to support their position.                         The average pro-life activist is a married woman in her mid  40s. She married early in her  teens-usually around 17- and has three or more children. Her father graduated from high school only,  and she probably never graduated college.    She is usually not employed, and is married to a small businessman or  lower income white-collar worker. Her  family income is less than 30000/yr.    Religion is an integral part of her life.  [7]        It is important to understand that the arguments pro-life  advocates use in defending their opinion are a cause of their deep rooted  beliefs. These arguments dont simply  arise from people who hold extreme views on abortion and oppose it firmly  without prior thought. For pro-lifers, abortions pose a threat to their life  values and morals. Most pro-life  activists believe being a mother and a wife is a womans most important  job. In their minds, men and women share  separate roles in society that compliment each other, and while men should be  in the workforce, women should commit their time to their families.      2.) Pro-Choice Profile       According to a national Gallup poll taken this month, also  used by CNN and USA Today, approximately 53 percent of Americans regard  themselves as pro-choice.                         The Alan  Guttmacher Institute is a  nonprofit organization focused on sexual and reproductive health research and  policy analysis. They regularly undertake demographic research and publish  their own and others scientifically collected data. According to this data,  taken most recently in 2002, the majority of women having abortions are in  their 20's (56 percent). The abortion rate among teenagers has declined in  recent years (19 percent between ages 15-19), with the Institute arguing it  being because of the use of long-acting hormonal contraceptives, mainly the  injectable. The largest group of women having abortions in America are non-Hispanic  white women at 41 percent, however, Black and Hispanic women together make up  more than half. This number is greater than their proportion in the population  because they have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy, and, among black  women, because they are more likely to resolve an unintended pregnancy through  abortion. In regards to religious affiliation most women are either Protestant  or Catholic. Additionally, more than half of women having abortions in 2000  were poor or low income. In summary, women having abortions are predominately  young, single, from minority groups, and had low-income      The pro-choice public in America are spearheaded by a few  main national interest groups. Among them are the National Abortion Rights  Action League, the National Abortion Federation, and Planned Parenthood. These  people hold very strong beliefs primarily rooted in what they call a  constitutional right for a woman to possess control over her own body. They  advocate sexual education programs in schools, access to contraceptives, and no  restrictions in obtaining abortions from qualified doctors. Currently they are  fighting against restrictions to abortions like mandatory parental  notifications, 24-hr waiting periods, a doctors right to deny contraceptives,  and heavily funded abstinence only programs that are criticized as giving  false, misleading or distorted information (Henry Waxman report, proponent of  sex ed).       ANALYSIS OF ISSUES                         One of the key controversies of the issue of abortion is  centered around the question of when life begins. Pro-life advocates argue that the beginning  of life is not a moral, religious or personal debate, but a biological fact, as  they understand existence to begin at the moment of conception. If the right to  life, that is, the entitlement to exist and develop naturally on our planet, is  to be understood as a central privilege of human beings, abortion thus becomes  a decision to designate oneself as a higher form of life acting on the capacity  to take away this assumed right.        Pro-choice advocates stance on the question of when life  begins is often undermined as a religious question, as they adapt their  position to be that of a womens rights issue, not a moral judgment call. Furthermore, pro-choice advocates believe  that the fetus is not a person, but rather a potential person, and as such it  is not entitled to the same rights under the law as everyone else is.       Regarding sex education and/or contraceptives, the pro-life  side argues that the most effective and appropriate contraceptive method is  abstinence, or in some cases family planning.    Generally, pro-life supporters argue that contraceptives encourage teens  to be sexually active in the first place, which in turn leads to a high rate of  teen pregnancies. Statistically, 20 percent  of abortions are performed on women under 20, and about all 48 percent of  pregnancies are unintended  [8]  .  Pro-life advocates are aware that contraceptive methods are readily available  and that they could reduce the number of abortions, yet they reject them on  moral and social grounds.                         The stance of the pro-choice side is vehemently against the  restriction of access to non-surgical abortions and emergency contraceptives to  women. In 2000, the FDA approved RU 486, also known as mifepristone, which  gives women the option to end an unintended pregnancy without surgery.  Proponents of the pill say it could transform abortion in the United States by  making it more accessible and more private. 9 Anti-choice lawmakers have failed to outlaw  it, but are continuing efforts to make it difficult to obtain. Additionally,  what is called perhaps the most controversial legislation proposed is HB 16,  an Act that would give pharmacies the right to refuse to give out emergency  contraceptives, like Plan B, popularly referred to as the morning-after pill.  Pills such as this do not disrupt existing pregnancies like the RU 486, but  prevent them by preventing ovulation, fertilization of an egg or implantation  in the uterus. (San Antonio News). Put simply, this drug is a concentrated dose  of the birth control pill, and can reduce a womens chance of becoming pregnant  by 89 percent (NARAL).The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  estimate that greater access to emergency contraceptives could cut the  unintended pregnancy and abortion rate in half. Additionally, The Journal of  the American Medical Association published a study, finding that emergency  contraceptives do not increase unprotected sex or promiscuity in young women.       Pro-choice advocates call for age-appropriate, medically  accurate sexual education programs that promote both abstinence and information  on protection advice. NARALs research found that 99 percent of Americans  believe it is appropriate for young people to have information about sexually  transmitted infections and venereal diseases, and 94 percent think it is  appropriate to teach teens about birth control. This is further backed by a  Scripps Howard Texas Poll commissioned by the Texas Association of Planned  Parenthood Affiliates, which found that 90 percent of people polled favor sex  education in public schools that is age appropriate and provides accurate  information on abstinence, birth control, and sexually transmitted infections  and venereal diseases. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 61 percent of  12 th graders and 35 percent of 9 th graders in 2001 have  had sex. And Kaiser along with National Public Radio and Harvards Kennedy  School of Government found Americans want broader sex education in the  schools. Only 15 percent say they want only abstinence-only taught in sex  education (San Antonio News).                        Another major argument pro-life supporters use is that even  though a woman has a right to control her own body, she doesnt have the right  to kill her fetus via an abortion.    Pro-lifers argue there are many other ways a pregnant woman can handle a  difficult situation that dont necessarily resort to abortion. Though pro-life supporters are quick to point  out the numerous options available to a woman in a difficult situation other  than abortion, they often ignore the nine months of mental and physical burden  necessary to bring a child to term. Essentially, the pro-life argument here is  based on moral claims since they offer no substantial evidence on why a womans  right to control her own body doesnt include the right to decide whether she  wants an abortion or not.      The bottom line to all pro-choice organizations and  supporters is not only the notion that it is constitutional to have a right to  privacy, but also the issue that abortion is fundamentally a fight for a  womans right to govern her own body. Pro-choice advocates believe in this  right to privacy freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into their  personal and private affairs. And they see it not as an ideological fight rooted  in religious beliefs, but a civil rights pursuit advocating a womens right to  choose. Their studies show abortion to be one of the safest medical procedures  that exists today, and they make their point vividly clear  by comparing the death rate from legal abortions as less  than from a shot of penicillin.        The next issue that flares the controversy is pregnancy in  cases of rape or incest. Pro-life  advocates argue it is humanly cruel to turn these tragic and horrible crimes  into a second more deliberate crime: the killing of the fetus. They also cite cases of mothers who have  decided to keep the baby claiming they turned something horrible into something  life-giving. Furthermore, the low  statistics involved (only 1 percent of abortions are cases or rape or incest),  can hardly justify the legalization of abortion for the other 99 percent.                         Finally, the social implications and reasons behind  abortions generate another important point of disagreement between pro-life and  pro-choice sides. Prior to analyzing  these social issues, it is important to note that the beliefs of people are  usually closely associated with social markers such as race, age, religious  affiliation, and sex. Social issues that  relate to the abortion debate often include the following: poverty,  overpopulation, abuse, unwanted kids and the risks of illegal abortions.       Well briefly  present the argument pro-life advocates have regarding each of the above. Regarding poverty, pro-lifers argue that the  poor mother today, is just as poor tomorrow, regardless of whether she has an  abortion or carries the fetus to term.    Problems such as poverty and job security are not solved by killing a  fetus. Based solely on statistics, about  21.3 percent of women who got abortions couldnt afford the baby. The other 78.7 percent got abortions for  other reasons unrelated to poverty.       Regarding overpopulation and unwanted kids, pro-life  advocates argue the problem is lack of development not overpopulation. They, however, offer no alternative solution  to the problem they introduce. Unwanted  children can always be put up for adoption or in foster care clinics, but  killing fetuses is not the answer.       STATISTICS       -Publics opinion                         61% believe abortion should not be banned completely       37% believe abortion should be banned except when  mothers life is at stake.      About 22% believe abortions should be legal in all  circumstances      41% want current laws to remain the same              -Abortion and Pregnancy Rates       From 1973 to about 1978 abortion rates per 1000 women  steadily increased      Starting around 1978 abortion rates per 1000 women  equilibrated until 1990, when they started to slightly decrease.      The decreasing trend in abortion rates seems to continue  nowadays.      About 52% of pregnancies are intended, whereas the rest  are unintended      53% of women who have unintended pregnancies were using  contraceptive method during the month they became pregnant, although usually  not correctly every time      Of all the unintended pregnancies, 47% resulted in  abortions and only 40% in births. The remaining 13% were miscarriages.             -Reasons for Abortions       The two most popular reasons for getting abortions were  inadequate finances to raise a child and women/couple not being ready for the  responsibility of raising a child      Other popular reasons for getting abortions included  womans life would be changed too much, problems with relationship/unmarried  and women being too young to have a child.      Abortions obtained for reasons related to womans or  fetus health problems add up to about 4%      Note: most women give more than one reasons for getting  an abortion.      It is important to note that about 50% of women getting  an abortion have previously gotten at least one other abortion.            POLICY RECOMMENDATION             While implementing a policy that would solve the  controversial problem of abortion seems highly unreasonable we can nonetheless  elaborate one that will somehow reduce tension over the issue in the general  public. Based on our careful analysis of the history of the issue, its social and  political implications, data analysis and the elements that make it such a  divisive one, we advise adopting the following policy:                        Based on public  opinion polls and sexual and reproductive health research we recommend that  abortion remain legal under certain circumstances. One restriction on abortion  should be parental notification and consent for minors under the age of 18. We  also suggest that women getting an abortion and the father of the fetus should  attend confidential classes where they would receive information about  contraceptive methods and how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Regarding sexual  education, we believe it should be implemented in the public educational  system, with objective, age-appropriate classes, in hopes that an informed  future generation will reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies as a whole. As  previously noted, both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  and the Journal of American Medical Association stand by their findings which  indicate that increased access to contraceptives does not increase promiscuity  in women, but may be able to downsize the annual rate of abortions. The current  laws permitting contraceptive methods such as RU 486 and Plan B should remain,  while the act known as HB 16, which allows pharmacies to refuse access to these  contraceptives, should be repealed to allow greater availability, thus  potentially reducing the overall number of abortions. While some citizens may disagree with certain  aspects in the above policy, based on public opinion polls such as the  CNN/Gallop/USA Today surveys, we believe  that the majority of the American public is in favor of abortion remaining  legal in most cases, while simultaneously expanding government efforts to reduce  the need for abortion by implementing methods indicated in the aforementioned  policy recommendation                                                Works Cited       1.
