Before coming to NYU, Romer taught at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. While there he took an entrepreneurial detour to start Aplia, an education technology company dedicated to increasing student effort and classroom engagement. Prior to Stanford, Romer taught in the economics departments at the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Chicago, and the University of Rochester. In 2002, he received the Recktenwald Prize for his work on the role of ideas in sustaining economic growth.    Romer earned a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago after doing graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and and Queens University.   ______________________________________________________________     Shlomo (Solly) Angel   Adjunct Professor and Senior Research Scholar  Shlomo (Solly) Angel is an adjunct professor at NYU and senior research scholar at the NYU Stern Urbanization Project, where he leads the Urban Expansion initiative. Angel is an expert on urban development policy, having advised the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). He currently focuses on documenting and planning for urban expansion in the developing world.    In 1973, he started a program in Human Settlements Planning and Development at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok. He taught at the Institute from 1973 to 1983, while researching housing and urban development in the cities of East, South, and Southeast Asia. From the mid-80s to mid-90s, he worked as a housing and urban development consultant to UN-Habitat, the Asian Development Bank, and the Government of Thailand. In 2000, he published Housing Policy Matters, a comparative study of housing conditions and policies around the world. From 2000 onward, he prepared housing sector assessments of 11 Latin America and Caribbean countries for the IDB and the World Bank.    Angel earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in architecture and a doctorate in city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley.   ______________________________________________________________     Alain Bertaud   Senior Research Scholar   Alain Bertaud is a senior research scholar at the NYU Stern Urbanization Project. At the moment, he is writing a book about urban planning that is tentatively titled Order Without Design. Bertaud previously held the position of principal urban planner at the World Bank. After retiring from the Bank in 1999, he worked as an independent consultant. Prior to joining the World Bank he worked as a resident urban planner in a number of cities around the world: Bangkok, San Salvador (El Salvador), Port au Prince (Haiti), Sana\u2019a (Yemen), New York, Paris, Tlemcen (Algeria), and Chandigarh (India).    Bertaud\u2019s research, conducted in collaboration with his wife Marie-Agn\u00e8s, aims to bridge the gap between operational urban planning and urban economics. Their work focuses primarily on the interaction between urban forms, real estate markets and regulations. Bertaud earned the Architecte DPLG diploma from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris.   ______________________________________________________________     Brandon Fuller   Deputy Director and Research Scholar  Brandon Fuller is deputy director and research scholar at the NYU Stern Urbanization Project.

Program    Since the spring 2000 semester the Mathematics Department has sponsored a number of summer research experiences (S.U.R.E.) for a selected number of undergraduates math majors. The Summer Undergraduate Research Experience is aimed at advanced undergraduate math students in their junior year. The project ends with a written report and an oral presentation in the beginning of the fall semester.    Funds to support this activity are limited and student participants are chosen by a faculty committee based on grades, coursework, and fit between their research interests and those of the  supervising faculty. Applications are considered more highly if students have found a faculty mentor and research topic. To apply for this program please click here to find the application.

Dr. Louis Tao (a postdoc at the Courant Institute and the Center for Neural Science) assisted in the development and presentation of the course. The students also joined the visual neuroscience working group, attending the working seminar \"Neural Tuesday.\" Alex began an undergraduate research project in summer 2001, which continued during the academic year and will continue into summer 2002. During the academic year, his research work will be applied toward an undergraduate honors thesis. The research project studies coarse-grained mean field approaches to global modeling of the primary visual cortex. The work began with a literature search to unveil coupling architectures between the cortical layers of V1, from anatomical laboratory observations. Alex then constructed the architecture of an idealized network and began the construction of a numerical model under the large-scale scientific computational guidance of Professor David Cai.   Rachel Blumberg studied mathematical modeling of epidemics and the evolution of gene frequencies under the pressure of natural selection with Professor Daniel Tranchina. Rachel studied both discrete-time and continuous time models with an emphasis on the formulation of equations and on their numerical solution. Rachel learned about first-order and second-order accurate methods for solving systems coupled nonlinear differential equations and how to implement these methods in Matlab. Other topics touched on include phase plane analysis, analytic solution of trajectories, and Monte Carlo simulations for small population sizes.   Darin Comeau (VIGRE-supported) worked with Professor Lai-Sang Young and William Cowieson (VIGRE Postdoc) in the summer of 2001. As a preparation he read Devaney's book \"An Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems\" and successfully completed two projects. In the first, he worked out by himself, following hints from a book, a proof of Sarkovskii's Theorem. (Sarkovskii's Theorem is a well known theorem - with an elementary proof - concerning periodic behavior for one-dimensional maps.) The proof was written up formally in a report. Comeau's second project was to carry out a numerical study of the H\\'enon maps. Using Matlab, he discovered a number of properties of chaotic attractors. Comeau is currently (Spring 2002) enrolled in an Independent Study course with Young and Cowieson. The topic for this course is the mathematical theory of fractals.    David Lorentz (VIGRE-supported) was another student in the Mathematical Neuroscience course offered by Professors McLaughlin and Shelley in spring 2001. David then began an undergraduate research project in summer 2001, which continued during the academic year and will continue into summer 2002. The research project involved a study in cortical visual processing of the effects of a slow receptor (NMDA) and its comparison to the much faster AMPA receptor. First, models of the nonlinearity of the NMDA receptor were studied and developed -- comparing the accuracy and efficiency of different representations for use in large-scale neuronal network models. The work involved literature searches, computational modeling, and post-processing. David is currently developing an idealized network of simple and complex cells -- comparing the relative effects of AMPA and NMDA receptors on the neurons' performance characteristics.   Tim Novikoff (VIGRE-supported) was a third student in the Mathematical Neuroscience course offered by Professors McLaughlin and Shelley in spring 2001. Tim also began his undergraduate research project in summer 2001, which continued during the spring semester 2002 into summer 2002. His research project began with a study of the theoretical mechanisms behind the nonlinearity of the NMDA receptor. It then turned to the construction of very idealized models of neuronal networks with both simple and complex cells present, in which the performance of phased averaged networks were compared with that of networks with selective coupling mechanisms which produce inhibition in \"push-pull\" antagonism to excitation.   Patricia Tong (VIGRE-supported) worked with Professor Robert Kohn and two graduate students, Oana Fainarea and Pedro Judice, on a problem of optimal investment strategies using options. Her project addressed the following question: consider an investor who wishes to speculate on a stock by buying call options rather than the stock itself. How should this investor decide which calls -- i.e. which strike prices -- to buy? In giving this problem a mathematical formulation, Tong was led to read about the Black-Scholes theory of option pricing and the Capital Asset Pricing Model of portfolio optimization. But she also learned that the answer did not lie in these standard tools alone. With further modeling, she did find a suitable answer, which she is now writing up (with Kohn's guidance) in a form suitable for publication. Patricia participated in an REU at Worcester Polytechnic Institute during Summer 2002.   Brad Weir worked with Professor Richard Pollack on \"Algorithms in real Algebraic Geometry.\" In fall 2001, Brad worked through the first chapter of the book of the same title. He has digested the Lefschetz principle (quantifier elimination over algebraically closed fields and the associated transfer principle. This spring he will start thinking about problems related to the Tarski-Seidenberg principle (quantifier elimination over real closed fields) and the basic topology of semialgebraic sets.   Elizabeth Zollinger (VIGRE-supported) worked with Professors Charles Newman of the Courant Institute and C. D. Howard of Baruch College on simulations of certain dependent percolation models arising from interacting particle systems and cellular automata. After a preparatory period in spring 2001, in which Elizabeth learned about percolation and interacting particle systems, the project itself began in summer 2001 and continued in fall 2001 and spring 2002. (Elizabeth received VIGRE support during all these periods.)                          &copy; NEW YORK UNIVERSITY"}]}]
