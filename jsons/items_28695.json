We want you to learn how to model situations in order to solve problems. If you have already taken calculus before, we want you to gain an even deeper understanding of this fascinating subject.     The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function. The definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. These two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science. The rules by which we can compute the derivative (respectively, the integral) of any function are called a calculus. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus links the two processes of differentiation and integration in a beautiful way.               Study this course with others   Connect with other around the world  Meet others studying the same NYU courses as you. Help them or get help yourself if you need it.   Get help when you need it  Ask a question and get matched with someone who can answer it immediately and in real time.   Work on assignments together  There's no need to take an Open Education course alone. Learn together!
