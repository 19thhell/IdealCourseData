A ban was placed on the film for 50 years\u2026          - L\u2019Atalante   (1934) by Jean Vigo      \u00ab Classical, almost violent and always  tormented, fevered, overflowing with ideas and with fantasy \u00bb (Elie  Faure).

The French government banned it, but  after the War it has come to be seen by many film critics and directors as one  of the greatest films of all time.          - My  Uncle (1958) by Jacques Tati      A satire of postwar France's infatuation with  modern architecture, mechanical efficiency and American-style consumerism  (special Prize at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival ; 1959 Academy Award for  Best Foreign Film).           - Hiroshima  My Love (1959) by Alain Resnais      A film about the impossible relationship between  a French woman and a Japanese man questioning, love, war and memory. A film  made by one of the most influential French modernist director. Screenplay by  Marguerite Duras (Special Award at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival).          - Breathless (1960) by Jean-Luc Godard      A penniless young thug who models himself on the  film persona of Humphrey Bogart\u2026 On the run from the police, he turns to his  American girlfriend, a student and aspiring journalist, who sells the New York  Herald Tribune on the streets of Paris... A film that symbolizes the \u00ab New  Wave \u00bb for its bold visual style (1960 Jean Vigo Prize).          -  Tout va bien (1972) by Jean-Luc Godard and  Jean-Pierre Gorin      How can cinema have a real impact on society ? Godard  and Gorin explore the intersections of radicalism with cinema and modernism in  the wake of the May 68\u2019 riots.          -  Diva (1981) by Jean-Jacques Beineix      The story of a young postal carrier with a  passion for music.

I investigate how mass audiences embrace films on the basis of myths and sensibilities that may revive or adjust ancient narratives to modern times. Literature, aesthetics, history, geography and sociology are key in my attempt to excavate these resurgences. I have written on the relationships between film and literature, theory, space, and politics. My current research focuses on how French film theorists and critics laid the foundation for a sociological approach to film prior to the advent of political modernism.

Permission of the instructor required to enroll :       \u00ab Teaching  French Cinema \u00bb course      or  background in Cinema Studies recommended.             Goal  of the course :       The relationships  between French cinema and politics are twofold : cinema is not only the  mirror image of the political situation in France. It has also been seen as a  key factor in political change. The goal of the course is to analyze the  representation of the political backdrop in French cinema and the shaping of a  collective political consciousness through film in France from the 1930s to the  election of Nicolas Sarkozy. The emphasis is placed on film analysis, the  review of the historical context and the theoritical debates gravitating around  film form and ideology.           The following periods and themes will be discussed :            - The social struggles of the 1930s : the cinema of the  Popular Front ;      - The cinema of Occupation and the impact of the Vichy  ideology on filmmaking (1940-44) ;      - The Cold War, decolonization, filmmaking and film  criticism in the 1950s;      - May 1968, Political modernism and the diverging paths of  the New Wave ;      - Post-modernism and the dusk of the \u00ab cin\u00e9ma  engag\u00e9 \u00bb in the 1980s;      - The revival of politics in the 1990s \u2013 2000s: social  struggle and national identity in the context of globalization.            An  emphasis will be placed on the following films and directors :            Jean Vigo : A propos de Nice (1930)      Ren\u00e9 Clair : Liberty for us (1931)      Jean Renoir : The Crime of Mr. Lange (1936)      Jean Renoir : Liberty for us (1936)      Andr\u00e9 Malraux and Boris Peskine: Man\u2019s Hope (1938)      Claude Chabrol : The Eye of Vichy (1993)      Alain Resnais and Chris Marker : Statues Also Die (1953)      Alain Resnais : Night and Fog (1955)      Jacques Willemont : La reprise du travail aux usines Wonder (1968)       Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin : Tout va bien (1972)      Georges P\u00e9rec : Un homme qui dort (1974)      Jean-Jacques Beineix : Diva (1981)      Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne : The Promise (1996)      Robert Gu\u00e9diguian : Marius  and Jeannette (1997)      Robert Gu\u00e9diguian : The  Last Mitterrand (2005)      Laurent Cantet : Human  Ressources (1999)      Jean-Pierre Jeunet : Am\u00e9lie (2001)      Nicolas Phillibert : To Be and to Have (2002)      Raymond Depardon : 10th Court District (2004)            EVALUATION :    3 written clip analysis                                         NYU Department of French                              19 University Place, 6th Floor                        New York, NY 10003                 Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
