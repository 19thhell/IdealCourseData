About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.                       About our Institute       We offer full post-graduate training in psychoanalysis as well as advanced training in psychotherapy. Our faculty provides most of the psychotherapy teaching and supervision for NYU psychiatry residents. Candidates in our programs are psychiatrists (usually post-residency), psychologists, and clinical social workers who are supervised by members of our faculty.

The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.

Interns in this track participate in three four-month rotations. Rotation preferences are ranked at the beginning of the internship year in collaboration with the internship director. On these rotations, the intern assumes responsibility for a combination of assessment, consultation and direct clinical care duties. Other times are designated for various outpatient services, psychological assessment, supervision and seminars. Bilingual and multilingual students are encouraged to apply.\u00a0 Please note that Spanish-speaking students will have the opportunity to carry up to 2 individual adult outpatient cases in Spanish at any given time and may have the opportunity to conduct group or family therapy in Spanish as well.     Each intern carries a diverse outpatient psychotherapy caseload, representing a spectrum of demographic and cultural backgrounds, clinical presentations and treatment needs. Interns in the Adult Psychology Track carry a minimum of five outpatient adults as well as one child, one adolescent, one family, and one adult group, which is co-led by either two interns or by one intern and one psychiatry resident or social worker.     Interns receive a minimum of six hours of supervision per week. Supervision of psychotherapy is conducted according to numerous theoretical orientations including brief dynamic, cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic. Interns are assigned individual supervisors for each rotation experience, each outpatient psychotherapy case, and each psychological assessment case. Supervision of group psychotherapy is typically conducted with both co-leaders present. Family therapy supervision is conducted live. Supervisors, along with a team of fellow trainees, observe family therapy sessions through a one-way mirror and telephone the therapist with comments and/or suggestions.

About our Institute              About the Consultation and Treatment Service        The Institute for Psychoanalytic Education, affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, offers low-fee psychoanalysis and psychotherapy to adults, adolescents and children in the New York metropolitan area. The service is designed for people who are committed to relieving their emotional difficulties through self-exploration under the guidance of highly trained professionals. Treatment is provided by members of the Institute community -- psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, and professionals in allied mental health disciplines -- who are in advanced training at IPE in psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic therapy.             What is the difference between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ?       Psychoanalysis is an intensive treatment, usually occurring four to five times weekly, for a wide variety of emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, work difficulties, troubled relationships, sexual concerns, and issues of self-esteem. It is based on the belief that individuals are often unaware of factors that shape their emotions and behavior. Unconscious influences can produce specific symptoms or more general emotional distress. Psychoanalytic treatment is a therapeutic partnership focused on helping each patient become aware of the underlying sources of his or her difficulties -- not just intellectually but also emotionally, in ways that lead to deep and lasting changes in the person&rsquo;s life. A consultation can help determine whether psychoanalysis is the appropriate treatment for you.       Our Institute also offers a less intensive form of therapy-- psychoanalytic psychotherapy--that usually occurs once or twice weekly and is based on the same principles as psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis.       Read more information on psychoanalysis from the American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA).       Who is eligible for treatment?        We invite inquiries from anyone who would like to consider psychoanalytic treatment as well as individuals desiring psychoanalytic psychotherapy. We also welcome referrals from health professionals. Parents may apply for services for children under the age of 18. Children and adolescents may be eligible for special grants to pay for cab fare and/or caregiver fees to facilitate attending treatment. Please contact the office (646-754-4870) for more information.         We will do our best to match each applicant with a therapist who meets his or her needs. If we are unable to match an applicant with a therapist from our Institute, we will provide assistance with referrals to clinics outside of our Institute.                            Where does treatment occur?     Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are conducted in therapists&rsquo; private offices in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester (locations subject to availability). Please note that we do not see patients in our Institute administrative offices at 1 Park Avenue.       Is treatment in other languages provided?       We can provide psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in Spanish, French, German, and Greek (subject to therapist availability).       How much does it cost?       Your $50 application fee (waived for members of the NYU community) covers the processing of your application by IPE as well as up to three consultation office visits. If the consultation extends beyond three visits because of missed appointments, cancellation on short notice, or significant lateness, the consulting therapist may charge a mutually agreeable fee for any additional session(s) needed to complete the consultation. The therapist who performs the consultation will discuss this with you if the situation arises.            The Institute offers both psychoanalysis and psychotherapy at well below the usual and customary rates. Beyond the maximum of three consultation visits, fees for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy are worked out between patient and therapist, and are based on consideration of individual financial circumstances, including income and insurance.            We offer fees starting at $50 per session for psychotherapy. The frequency of sessions in psychoanalysis is greater than in once or twice weekly psychotherapy, and the setting of the fee takes this greater frequency into consideration; so, the fee per session for psychoanalysis may in some instances be less than the $50 per session minimum psychotherapy fee.                    Is health insurance accepted?     Treatment through our service begins with a consultation of up to three sessions, covered by a flat fee of $50 (waived for members of the NYU community; see below, How does the application process work? ).    Should you apply for treatment, the aim of that consultation will be to match you with a therapist appropriate to your needs - including your need for affordable therapy. Most of our therapists are not in-network providers for insurance panels, and we have only a limited number of therapists who accept Medicare. But treatment within network is not always the best, most affordable option. Some insurance plans have high co-payments and offer a limited number of sessions even with an in-network provider; and some insurance plans offer partial reimbursement for out-of-network services.    If we cannot find a therapist within your insurance network, we may be able to find one with whom your out of pocket expenses are no different from those you would incur within network. On your application, you&rsquo;ll be asked to provide some basic information about financial resources available to pay for treatment. You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to discuss the specifics of your financial situation with your consulting therapist.                        Is medication management provided?     We do not offer medication management as a stand-alone service, but medication needs can be assessed during consultation or in an ongoing treatment. Some of our therapists are psychiatrists who can prescribe medication. Non-MD therapists can offer help in arranging for medication referrals.    How does the application process work?       You can download the application directly from our website. We can also email, fax, or mail it to you. You can mail the $50 application fee to our office or pay online (Paypal, credit, debit, or e-check). If you are a member of the NYU community -- student, faculty, or staff -- there is no application fee.    Once you have completed the written application, you will be put in touch with a member of our service for a brief telephone screening. The purpose of the phone screening is to have a preliminary discussion of your treatment needs and to arrange for you to meet with one of our therapists, usually in his or her private office, for a consultation. This consultation is intended to give you an opportunity to discuss your particular situation and needs in greater depth.    The consulting therapist will help you to consider available treatment options. Depending on the consulting therapist&rsquo;s assessment of your needs, he or she may offer to continue working with you or may suggest referral to another therapist. Recommendations that may develop from the screening and consultation process include:       Psychoanalysis or psychoanalytic therapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychoanalytic training program.    Psychotherapy with a therapist receiving clinical supervision in our psychotherapy training program.    Treatment with a member of the Institute community who is not receiving supervision for his or her work with you (i.e.: psychoanalysts-in-training, for treatments not conducted at four- or five-times weekly frequency; Institute faculty).    When necessary, referral to a practitioner or agency outside the Institute community.                                           How long does the process take before treatment begins?  Depending on availability, within a week of receiving your completed application, we&rsquo;ll put you in touch with a member of our service for a phone screening. The in-person consultation usually occurs over a period of one to three weeks, and treatment generally begins soon after.             Please note: we do not provide emergency care or immediate treatment. In the event of a psychiatric or life threatening emergency, please go to your nearest emergency room or call 911.

Interns in this track participate in three four-month rotations. Rotation preferences are ranked at the beginning of the internship year in collaboration with the internship director. On these rotations, the intern assumes responsibility for a combination of assessment, consultation and direct clinical care duties. Other times are designated for various outpatient services, psychological assessment, supervision and seminars. Bilingual and multilingual students are encouraged to apply.\u00a0 Please note that Spanish-speaking students will have the opportunity to carry up to 2 individual adult outpatient cases in Spanish at any given time and may have the opportunity to conduct group or family therapy in Spanish as well.     Each intern carries a diverse outpatient psychotherapy caseload, representing a spectrum of demographic and cultural backgrounds, clinical presentations and treatment needs. Interns in the Adult Psychology Track carry a minimum of five outpatient adults as well as one child, one adolescent, one family, and one adult group, which is co-led by either two interns or by one intern and one psychiatry resident or social worker.     Interns receive a minimum of six hours of supervision per week. Supervision of psychotherapy is conducted according to numerous theoretical orientations including brief dynamic, cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic. Interns are assigned individual supervisors for each rotation experience, each outpatient psychotherapy case, and each psychological assessment case. Supervision of group psychotherapy is typically conducted with both co-leaders present. Family therapy supervision is conducted live. Supervisors, along with a team of fellow trainees, observe family therapy sessions through a one-way mirror and telephone the therapist with comments and/or suggestions.
