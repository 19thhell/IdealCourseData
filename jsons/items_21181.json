Notes regarding historical evaluation results in the Smart Evals System                               Semesters Available   The Global Academic Center course evaluation results available in the Smart Evals system date back to Spring 2008. Terms prior to Spring 2011* were conducted on paper and open-ended comments are not available online. In most cases scanned copies of the original student responses are on file at the Office of Global Programs. Email global.academics@nyu.edu for access to these scanned copies or for inquiries about evaluation data from semesters prior to spring 2008.   Subject Heading Conversions   Prior to summer 2011 NYU operated under a different course numbering sequence in regard to subject headings using a one letter two digit code for subject headings (eg. V45). All subject headings have been converted to the current subject heading in the Smart Evals system (i.e. V45 was changed to FREN-UA). Email global.academics@nyu.edu should you have any questions regarding a subject heading conversion.   *CAS Summer Programs transitioned to online evaluations in Summer 2010.

Notes regarding historical evaluation results in the Smart Evals System                               Semesters Available   The Global Academic Center course evaluation results available in the Smart Evals system date back to Spring 2008. Terms prior to Spring 2011* were conducted on paper and open-ended comments are not available online. In most cases scanned copies of the original student responses are on file at the Office of Global Programs. Email global.academics@nyu.edu for access to these scanned copies or for inquiries about evaluation data from semesters prior to spring 2008.   Subject Heading Conversions   Prior to summer 2011 NYU operated under a different course numbering sequence in regard to subject headings using a one letter two digit code for subject headings (eg. V45). All subject headings have been converted to the current subject heading in the Smart Evals system (i.e. V45 was changed to FREN-UA). Email global.academics@nyu.edu should you have any questions regarding a subject heading conversion.   *CAS Summer Programs transitioned to online evaluations in Summer 2010.
