Description       American religion, historian Nathan Hatch writes, has \u201cless to do with the specifics of polity and governance and more with the incarnation of the church into popular culture.\u201d Although Hatch was writing about the 19th century, this complex relationship between the popular, the lived, and the liturgical continues to shape and define America today. In this course, we study and write about ways in which film, television, advertising, music, sports, politics, food, and the news media present, negotiate, and affect religious issues, and, conversely, how religion changes popular culture. We \u201cread\u201d primary texts of popular religion and popular culture, such as Billy Graham sermons, Mormon pageants, Lady Gaga videos, basketball and video games, as well as theoretical works by Jean Baudrillard, Elaine Graham, Peter Williams, Kate McCarthy, Eric Mazur, Susan Mizruchi, Richard Santana and Gregory Erickson. Students are encouraged to explore topics of their own interest, and assignments include reaction papers, various essay forms, and a final paper of critical analysis.
