From The Matrix to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, from the video game to comic books, its influence is tangible but so widespread that the pioneering work of Hong Kong filmmakers over the decades risks being unacknowledged by a wider audience. In this course we will examine the developments of five film genres from the 1970s on. These include the wuxia sword and chivalry films of King Hu and Tsui Hark, and the kung fu film, whose most iconic actors (Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Stephen Chow) also embody the genres moments of transition. We will be looking at innovations in the crime film by John Woo, and in Andrew Lau and Alan Maks Infernal Affairs trilogy. Asian horror has also made its mark thanks to the Hong Kong brand. Finally, in contrast to the gourmet treatment of violence in much of Hong Kongs popular cinema, the stylish nostalgia films of Stanley Kwan and Wong Kar-wai provide further insights into the identity politics of a regional, yet global cinema in a rapidly changing world.       May 21 June 8 (Session IA)  HITCHCOCK AND HIS INFLUENCE   Open to both graduate and undergraduate students    CINE-GT 1225 c#4710  CINE-UT 205 c#4307    Richard Allen  MTWR, 6:00-10:00pm  Hitchcock is the most recognized and imitated film director in the history of movies. The course will seek to examine and explain his influence. The class will begin by closely examining key works of Hitchcock (Rear Window, Vertigo, and Psycho) in order to understand the elements that make up Hitchcocks universe, in particular, the complex role and function of suspense. We shall then examine the nature and scope of Hitchcocks influence upon American and European Cinema, including films by Chabrol, Truffaut, Godard, Almodvar, Argento, Spielberg, Lynch, Demme and de Palma.      June 11 June 29 (Session IB)  SCORSESES NEW YORK   Open to both graduate and undergraduate students    CINE-GT 1230 c#4270  CINE-UT 230 c#4269   William Simon  MTWR, 6:00-10:00pm  This course will focus on the New York City films of Martin Scorsese. We shall approach several of the films (e.g. Gangs of New York, The Age of Innocence) as filmic examples of historical fiction and most of the other films in terms of their socio-cultural representations of New York City phenomena (e.g. immigration, crime, the art and entertainment industries). As well, we will be concerned with exploring Scorseses narrative method his usages of film form and style  in relation to the above issues.       SECOND SESSION    July 2 August 10  INTRO TO CINEMA STUDIES   CINE-UT 10 c#4308  Michelle Kelley  TR, 12:30-4:30pm  In the summer this course this course is open to non-majors and those looking for an introduction to the field. The course aims to provide Cinema Studies majors, Film & TV majors, and others with the knowledge and skills needed to think and write critically about film. This course introduces students to the study of cinema as an industry, art form and cultural practice. By learning about aspects of film form and style, such as narrative, cinematography, and editing, students gain familiarity with key terms and concepts in film studies. Students are also introduced to critical methods of film analysis and topics in film history. Screenings represent a wide range of genres and national cinemas spanning the history of the medium.      July 2 August 10  COMIC BOOK MOVIES   CINE-UT 169 c#4497  Wyatt Phillips  MW, 12:30-4:30pm  The presence on movie screens of stories that originated in comic books or graphic novels seems, over the past several years, to have increased considerably. Are these films representative of a new movie genre or are they merely one form of adaptation among many? This course will address both the long history of the relationship between comics and the cinema as well as survey theories of adaptation that allow for a greater understanding of the changes which occur as these stories are translated from sequential art to moving images. Particular attention will be paid to the dynamics of contemporary Hollywood filmmaking and its effect on this process. We will view several versions of the Superman story (radio, animation, television and theatrical film) as well as other superhero movies (Batman, The Punisher, Iron Man), but will also consider adaptations from other graphic sources such as 30 Days of Night and Ghost World.      July 2 August 10  PEDRO ALMODVAR   Open to both graduate and undergraduate students    CINE-GT 2220 c#4711  CINE-UT 220 c#4309     Chris Straayer  TR, 12:30-4:30pm  Pedro Almodvar is the most notorious Spanish filmmaker since Luis Buuel and, like Buuel, rapidly gained international acclaim. This course will attend to Almodvars appealing body of work (What Have I Done to Deserve This, Matador, Law of Desire, Tie Me Up Tie Me Down, All About My Mother, Talk to Her, Bad Education, Volver, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, among others) in relation to: national political history; international film exhibition; intertextual popular culture; comedy-thriller-melodrama genre mixing; convoluted narrative structures; theatrical uses of color, music, acting, and scale; interrelated themes of family, desire, and identity; and an aesthetics of excess. Finally we will consider the outstanding Almodvar within a context of \"influence.\""}]},
