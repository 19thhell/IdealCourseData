They will have the chance to test those ideas out with real learners at the New York Hall of Science, & subsequently improve on these designs. While the course will begin with a focus on constructivism & inquiry, students will experience the limitations of these learning theories as related to people's emotional & affective responses to instruction so designed. They will subsequently explore two much more \"playful\" learning modalities to help someone learn science: guided play & design-based science. Students will work in small teams to design & test instruction consistent with both approaches, aiming to teach the same middle school science content in both, so that they can compare & contrast their experiences. Three of the fourteen classes will be held on Saturdays to give students the opportunity to test their instructional designs-in-progress at the New York Hall of Science.

The selected environment can be a microworld, a game, distance education board, a content management system, a social network, or a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tool such as a media-based data archive & analysis tool. Throughout the course, we evaluate a range of existing learning environments that use technologies for game creation, toolkits, community builders, & emerging communications media. Final project includes a theoretical paper & an accompanying ?architecture? map/model, & workflow plan based on the theories presented in the course.

(Integrated into each cornerstone is the theme of values, ethics, & social justice.) An exemplar is discussed & then students form into a design team & take on the roles of developing a prototype of a unique learning environment based on the cornerstones. The selected environment can be a microworld, a game, distance education board, a content management system, a social network, or a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tool such as a media-based data archive & analysis tool. Throughout the course, we evaluate a range of existing learning environments that use technologies for game creation, toolkits, community builders, & emerging communications media. Final project includes a theoretical paper & an accompanying ?architecture? map/model, & workflow plan based on the theories presented in the course. Final projects are collaboratively critiques & adjudicated.

We not only study the often hidden connection between the research community members & the technologies they affect, but also how these theories play upon each other in the invention of new paradigms for learning with technologies. In short, we delve deeply into constructivism/constructionism, scaffolding, apprenticeship, distributed cognition, computer-supported collaborative learning, knowledge-building communities, the learning sciences, perspectivity, & identity formation as they relate to the creation of successful & equitable learning environments for diverse populations of learners. Students write a final paper & conduct an evaluation of the embedded theories in an existing learning environment of their choice (such as Second Life, Logo, Scratch, NetLogo, The Sims).

They will have the chance to test those ideas out with real learners at the New York Hall of Science, & subsequently improve on these designs. While the course will begin with a focus on constructivism & inquiry, students will experience the limitations of these learning theories as related to people's emotional & affective responses to instruction so designed. They will subsequently explore two much more \"playful\" learning modalities to help someone learn science: guided play & design-based science. Students will work in small teams to design & test instruction consistent with both approaches, aiming to teach the same middle school science content in both, so that they can compare & contrast their experiences. Three of the fourteen classes will be held on Saturdays to give students the opportunity to test their instructional designs-in-progress at the New York Hall of Science.
