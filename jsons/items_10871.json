We expect the application review process will continue throughout April. Due to the volume of applicants, we are unable to give you the status of your application or tell you if your application is complete. However, you can check if your application is complete on the SMTS website: http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/request/smts.html    Submitting your application online    To apply, you must use our online application . When using the online application, you can submit all materials electronically.    The online procedure is user-friendly; however, if you have any questions regarding the application process, please view the Application Resource Center's frequently-asked questions.    Note: You must arrange with the Educational Testing Services (ETS) to electronically submit GRE and TOEFL scores (if necessary) to our Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS). Our institution code for the GRE and TOEFL is 2596. You do not need to use a special department code for the GRE.    If you are required to take the TOEFL, this examination requires you to list a department code that is most appropriate for your field of study or you can simply use code 99. However, do not use code 00 and do not leave this field blank. We will not receive your test scores if you report it this way.    To expedite the processing of your application, you may include the unofficial copies of your results on these tests. However, we must receive the official scores from ETS before the admissions deadline.    Applicants should note the following:       Students with a BA/BS degree may apply directly to the PhD program.    There is no NYU or departmental based financial support for master's students.    GRE scores are required for all but non-degree applications.

In particular, students must have an accredited baccalaureate degree or its equivalent.    The following items are required:       A completed application, including a Statement of Purpose.    Three letters of recommendation    General GRE scores for all programs. (The computer science GRE subject test is recommended but not required for application to the PhD program.)    TOEFL scores for any student whose native language or medium of undergraduate instruction is not English    For MSIS applicants only: a resume or CV of your work experience.       Successful applicants to the MS program in Computer Science will generally have the following minimum qualifications:       Strong GRE Quantitative and Analytical scores. (Typical acceptable scores are near 700 for each of these sections, or 4.0 or better on the new Analytical Writing section.)    Positive, specific recommendations.    Strong grades in relevant courses.          MSIS applicants generally need the following to be admitted:       Exams:       Quantitative and analytical both above 85%, at least one above 92%    TOEFL, if required, above 620 (paper) or 260 (computer), or 100 (TOEFLI)          Grades:       Some As and all Bs or better in business, engineering and science courses at most recent school; higher grades expected from less selective institutions          Recommendations:       Strong recommendations from professor(s) and employer(s)          Work experience:       At least one year full-time experience in a demanding position    Evidence of leadership and management potential    Evidence of ability to excel professionally in a corporation          Computer science:       Evidence of ability to excel in graduate courses in computer science          English:       Evidence of ability to communicate effectively in writing and speech in graduate school and American corporations                The minimum prerequisite background for admission to the MS program consists of:       Languages: Deep working knowledge of C and familiarity with object-oriented concepts and work with some object-oriented language such as Java or C++.    Data structures and mathematics: Understanding and working knowledge of pointers, lists, stacks, queues, trees, arrays and recursion; induction, order of magnitude growth, probability and elementary combinatorics, set notation.    Working familiarity with windows and Unix.    Knowledge of assembly language (e.g. Intel or Motorola) sufficient to understand self-modifying code.       Promising students who do not have this background will be conditionally admitted with the provision that they complete the one year preparatory course (PAC). Students without adequate mathematical training should take Discrete Mathematics, which is offered in the summer only.         Edit All                   top | contact webmaster"}]}]
