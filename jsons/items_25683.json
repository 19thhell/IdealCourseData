Born and raised in the London, two years spent in Hong Kong, then ultimately landing in New York City, the clinical assistant professor of music business at NYU Steinhardt has experienced, purchased, and studied music on almost every continent of the globe.\u00a0 In 2006, two years into his doctoral studies, he developed a fascination with the vibrancy and potential of the Brazilian music market that continues to this day.     \u201cBrazil is poised to invigorate the global music industry, not purely because it\u2019s South America\u2019s juggernaut economy in terms of population and resources, nor due solely to its rich musical traditions, but because conditions are ripe for growth,\u201d says Howard-Spink.\u00a0 \u201cBrazilian investors are finally looking beyond exploitation of natural resources in favor of leveraging the country\u2019s cultural assets.\u00a0 In terms of possibilities, it\u2019s like Silicon Valley in the early 90s.\u201d   This thinking led Howard-Spink to create an intensive on-site course for his Music Business graduate students, Emerging Models and Markets for Music , in Rio de Janiero in cooperation with Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas (FGV), one of the top business schools in Latin America.\u00a0\u00a0 The goal was to enable students to learn the theory and current research on emerging music markets, while gaining first hand, practical experience that could provide them with both enhanced knowledge and on-site networking opportunities.   Response was overwhelmingly positive and immediate.\u00a0 Within weeks of announcing the class, there were 37 applicants for 30 spots.\u00a0 Students spent the day in classes at FGV, where guest speakers included music industry executives from such organizations as Som Livre, the music arm of Brazil\u2019s largest media company Globo, and Queremos, a Rio start-up that crowdfunds concerts.   \u201cPrior to signing up, I knew at the very least I\u2019d enjoy being in Brazil, but I was genuinely struck by how quickly we came to understand the vast distinctions in music business practices,\u201d said Isaac Stonberg, who worked in A&amp;R for Warner Music Group before enrolling in the Music Business program in September 2014.\u00a0 \u201cIn Brazil, performances are more participatory; touring practices &#8211; and therefore sponsorship opportunities &#8211; are significantly different; and the market hasn\u2019t experienced the widespread dominance of a few major distribution players, such as iTunes, Amazon or Spotify.\u00a0 It\u2019s a completely different game.\u201d     Cultural activities for the class included a visit to a samba school practicing for Rio\u2019s famous Carnivale celebration, a percussion lesson for the entire group, a visit to Sugarloaf Mountain, and networking parties with music business professionals.   According to Howard-Spink, the J-Term course is just the first step in what is slated to become an ongoing partnership with FGV.\u00a0 The course, which will be offered on alternate years, will later include Brazilian-based FGV students learning alongside NYU Students.\u00a0 And later in 2015, FGV will send a group of music executives to NYU Steinhardt for an intensive music business course at the Greenwich Village campus.   \u201cIn Brazil, it\u2019s still uncommon to educate students in the business of the music and media industries, and FGV intends to be at the forefront of that scholarship,\u201d said Erich Dietrich, Associate Dean for Global &amp; Academic Programs and Assistant Vice President for NYU Global.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNYU and FGV make natural partners, because both have well-established and proven pedagogical approaches, as well as locations in the world\u2019s most exciting music markets.\u201d   Until training in music business practices is more widespread, Howard-Spink believes that entrepreneurial-minded Steinhardt music business students will be well positioned to make the most of this and other emerging market opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0 And for their part, the students agree.   \u201cI\u2019d always pictured myself getting a job in New York or Los Angeles,\u201d said Stonberg.\u00a0 \u201cBut I could definitely live in Brazil.\u201d   -Shonna Keogan                                            Posted by Debra Weinstein on February 24, 2015 10:16 am   | Permalink |   Comments                                       &larr; NYU Symphony Orchestra to Perform Student Film Scores at Symphony Space, February 27th        Study Finds A Summer Entrepreneurship Program Has Far-Reaching Benefits for Teens &rarr;                                                      Search At a Glance                                             Follow NYU Steinhardt         Enter your email address now and get news delivered right to your inbox.

Born and raised in the London, two years spent in Hong Kong, then ultimately landing in New York City, the clinical assistant professor of music business at NYU Steinhardt has experienced, purchased, and studied music on almost every continent of the globe.\u00a0 In 2006, two years into his doctoral studies, he developed a fascination with the vibrancy and potential of the Brazilian music market that continues to this day.     \u201cBrazil is poised to invigorate the global music industry, not purely because it\u2019s South America\u2019s juggernaut economy in terms of population and resources, nor due solely to its rich musical traditions, but because conditions are ripe for growth,\u201d says Howard-Spink.\u00a0 \u201cBrazilian investors are finally looking beyond exploitation of natural resources in favor of leveraging the country\u2019s cultural assets.\u00a0 In terms of possibilities, it\u2019s like Silicon Valley in the early 90s.\u201d   This thinking led Howard-Spink to create an intensive on-site course for his Music Business graduate students, Emerging Models and Markets for Music , in Rio de Janiero in cooperation with Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas (FGV), one of the top business schools in Latin America.\u00a0\u00a0 The goal was to enable students to learn the theory and current research on emerging music markets, while gaining first hand, practical experience that could provide them with both enhanced knowledge and on-site networking opportunities.   Response was overwhelmingly positive and immediate.\u00a0 Within weeks of announcing the class, there were 37 applicants for 30 spots.\u00a0 Students spent the day in classes at FGV, where guest speakers included music industry executives from such organizations as Som Livre, the music arm of Brazil\u2019s largest media company Globo, and Queremos, a Rio start-up that crowdfunds concerts.   \u201cPrior to signing up, I knew at the very least I\u2019d enjoy being in Brazil, but I was genuinely struck by how quickly we came to understand the vast distinctions in music business practices,\u201d said Isaac Stonberg, who worked in A&amp;R for Warner Music Group before enrolling in the Music Business program in September 2014.\u00a0 \u201cIn Brazil, performances are more participatory; touring practices &#8211; and therefore sponsorship opportunities &#8211; are significantly different; and the market hasn\u2019t experienced the widespread dominance of a few major distribution players, such as iTunes, Amazon or Spotify.\u00a0 It\u2019s a completely different game.\u201d     Cultural activities for the class included a visit to a samba school practicing for Rio\u2019s famous Carnivale celebration, a percussion lesson for the entire group, a visit to Sugarloaf Mountain, and networking parties with music business professionals.   According to Howard-Spink, the J-Term course is just the first step in what is slated to become an ongoing partnership with FGV.\u00a0 The course, which will be offered on alternate years, will later include Brazilian-based FGV students learning alongside NYU Students.\u00a0 And later in 2015, FGV will send a group of music executives to NYU Steinhardt for an intensive music business course at the Greenwich Village campus.   \u201cIn Brazil, it\u2019s still uncommon to educate students in the business of the music and media industries, and FGV intends to be at the forefront of that scholarship,\u201d said Erich Dietrich, Associate Dean for Global &amp; Academic Programs and Assistant Vice President for NYU Global.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNYU and FGV make natural partners, because both have well-established and proven pedagogical approaches, as well as locations in the world\u2019s most exciting music markets.\u201d   Until training in music business practices is more widespread, Howard-Spink believes that entrepreneurial-minded Steinhardt music business students will be well positioned to make the most of this and other emerging market opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0 And for their part, the students agree.   \u201cI\u2019d always pictured myself getting a job in New York or Los Angeles,\u201d said Stonberg.\u00a0 \u201cBut I could definitely live in Brazil.\u201d   -Shonna Keogan                                            Posted by Debra Weinstein on February 24, 2015 10:16 am   | Permalink |   Comments                                       &larr; NYU Symphony Orchestra to Perform Student Film Scores at Symphony Space, February 27th        Study Finds A Summer Entrepreneurship Program Has Far-Reaching Benefits for Teens &rarr;                                                      Search At a Glance                                             Follow NYU Steinhardt         Enter your email address now and get news delivered right to your inbox.
