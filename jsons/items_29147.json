On January 18th a few lucky NYU students were able to sit in on the   \"dress rehearsal\" for Ahmir Questlove Thompson and Harry Weinger's   Spring 2013 course Topics in Recorded Music: Classic Albums. These   students were treated to an overview of the seminal James Brown album Live At The Apollo ,   with Questlove and Weinger deconstructing the tracks \"Sex Machine\" and   \"Funky Drummer,\" using the original multi-tracks to illustrate their   analysis. Questlove and Weinger were joined by some notable guests   during the dress rehearsal. Manning Pro-Tools for the session was   engineer Russ Elevado,   who is in-between sessions for the much anticipated new D'Angelo album.    Nelson George, a former NYU adjunct professor, filmed the breakdown of   these tracks for his forthcoming documentary for VH-1, \"Findin' The   Funk.\" And last, but certainly not least, Questlove and Weinger were   joined by special guest Alan Leeds, a former James Brown staffer who   attended the \"Sex Machine\" session back in the day. Friday,   February 1st was the official debut of Topics in Recorded Music: Classic   Albums. During the seven week course, Weinger, Questlove, students and   special guests discussed what constitutes as \u201cclassic\u201d or \u201ccanonical\u201d   in popular music. The course took a look at a series of subjective   examples of classic albums \u2014 in many cases albums that the instructors   hold dear \u2014 and deconstructed how and why those albums have come to be   considered as seminal in the trajectory of popular music. They addressed this subjectivity head-on, noting our own slant towards   post-1965 African-American expressions. In particular, they deconstructed the music, the production and the marketing of these albums,   putting them in full social and political context and exploring the   range of reasons why they have garnered classic status. ABOUT THE PROFESSORS                            Harry Weinger is a multiple Grammy-winning reissue producer, writer and   educator who is currently Vice President of A&amp;R for Universal Music   Enterprises, the catalog reissue arm of Universal Music Group.

In addition to his adjunct courses at NYU, he has delivered talks on   music history and the music business at Princeton University, Duke   University, Washington University at St. Louis, Carleton College and   others.  Ahmir Questlove Thompson is the unmistakable heartbeat of The   Roots, Philadelphia\u2019s most influential hip-hop band. He is currently   the Musical Director for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon where the beloved   Roots crew serves as house band.

On one hand, \u201cclassic\u201d suggests pre-eminent status, high standards, top quality. A classic album is one that has been deemed by many \u2013 or even just a select, influential few \u2013 as a standard bearer. On the other hand, the term classic can infer elitism and exclusion, and can signal a sort of inflexible members\u2019 only club: too often, the work of American and British white male rock artists is often venerated in this tradition at the expense of women and people of color and non-first world subjects among others. Taking this ongoing debate around the idea of classic as a starting point for discussion rather than an impasse, this unique course investigates the concept of the \"seminal\u201d album. For our purposes we can define a seminal album as one that has managed to further influence, in a groundbreaking way, the development of future forms of artistic expression. During the class, we look at a series of totally subjective examples of classic albums (in many cases albums that the instructors hold dear), and deconstruct how and why those albums have come to be considered as seminal in the trajectory of popular music. Among the albums that may be discussed: Sly &amp; the Family Stone's Stand! and There's A Riot Goin' On; Aretha Franklin's Lady Soul, Led Zeppelin's IV; The Eagles' Hotel California; Marvin Gaye's 70s albums, from What's Going On to Here, My Dear; Prince's Dirty Mind; Michael Jackson's Off The Wall; Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation Of Millions to Hold Us Back; Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique; Mary J. Blige's My Life. In particular, we will deconstruct the music, the production and the marketing of these albums, putting them in full social and political context and exploring the range of reasons why they have garnered classic status. We do this, of course, at a time in which the very meaning and future of the album is up for grabs given the ubiquity of digital retail formats that put an inordinate emphasis on the value of the single.
