The theories and the practice of Finance are challenged today by complex financial and global systems and by dynamically changing regulatory environments and politics. A global world in transition creates both opportunities and challenges for financial engineers to adapt theoretical and financial constructs into profitable and innovative opportunities by creating innovative, custom-designed instruments in the marketplace.   At the NYU School of Engineering, we train our students to do exactly that: to engineer the future of finance and transform financial theory into practice. The MS in Financial Engineering program furnishes students with foundational knowledge in financial concepts. This knowledge then becomes a springboard to specialized fields where students can apply concepts to everything from derivatives risk finance to financial IT and algorithmic trading on Big Data.   Students follow one of four different tracks as they earn their degree:      Financial Markets and Corporate Finance    Computational Finance    Technology and Algorithmic Finance    Risk Finance     Admissions   The Department receives a large number of applications every year. To be considered for admission into the MS in Financial Engineering program, students must have a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree from an accredited institution and proven mathematical proficiency in:      Linear Algebra    Probability Theory    Calculus (Advanced)    Applied Statistics    Computer Programming     Applicants must submit official transcripts from each institution attended as well as GRE test scores. When applicable, applicants must also demonstrate English language proficiency to be determined by the TOEFL score.   Students with degrees in other fields may be admitted at the discretion of departmental advisers. Before beginning graduate studies, conditionally approved students must demonstrate proficiency in basic statistics, probability and mathematics. The Department makes available refresher courses for this purpose and to serve the population of students who have been out of academia prior to matriculating into this program.
