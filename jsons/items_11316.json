He says, \u201cMy experience at NYU has changed my life\u2019s trajectory completely.\u201d Antonio has served as  a resident assistant in a freshman  residence hall, sat on various club  executive boards, and helped start a community service club. He was a key player in the successful implementation of a gender-neutral housing system. Antonio says, \u201cEvery day that I go to the Kimmel Center to lead a club meeting or plan a freshman event for my hall,  I know I\u2019ve become a leader who\u2019s been able to live out a dream. Simply put, without the support of NYU\u2019s alumni, parents, and friends, I would not have had that opportunity to excel.\u201d Upon graduating, Antonio plans to pursue  a graduate degree in higher education  administration with the goal of becoming a vice president of student affairs at an academic institution. \u201cMy goal is to pay it forward with my professional life: to keep working hard to positively impact the lives of others\u2014and to  make it possible for many others  to have the confidence to pursue  their own goals, too.\u201d                                    General University Scholarship Fund      CAS Annual Alumni Scholarship Fund      GSAS Annual Alumni Fellowship Fund      Heights Annual Alumni Scholarship Fund     College of Dentistry Alumni Scholarship Fund      College of Nursing Annual Scholarship Fund      Courant Fellowship Fund      Gallatin School Scholarship Fund      IFA 1932 Fund for Student Fellowships      Stern Fund - Graduate Scholarships      Stern Fund - Undergraduate Scholarships      Liberal Studies Annual Fund-Scholarship      NYU Langone Medical Center and School     NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering Promise Scholarship Fund     SPS Alumni Scholarship Fund     NYU Law Alumni Scholarship Fund      Social Work Alumni Annual Scholarship Fund      Steinhardt Alumni Scholarship Fund      Tisch School of the Arts Annual Scholarship Fund      Wagner Annual Alumni Scholarship Fund   Browse other giving opportunities...                 Actualizing Professional Dreams       NYU graduates land jobs, win grants,    and open doors that propel them toward   fulfilling their ambitions. Our graduates    consistently rank among some of the country\u2019s most successful young professionals, with    a placement rate in either full-time jobs    or graduate school of over 90 percent and   continuing to trend upward. For our graduate and professional school students, bright    futures and innovative ideas are the norm    in their professional lives, with many going    on to become leaders in their fields. Their    accomplishments increase the value of an    NYU education and the respect of our    alumni network. Now is the time to expand    access through increased scholarship and    give aid to more students who demonstrate    the potential to become the next generation    of global leaders.
