Here is a link to a catalogue for an exhibition of works by blind photographers at the California Museum of Photography, University of California Riverside in 2009.\u00a0 There are 4 short introductory essays plus a gallery of exhibiting artists including images + essays/artist statements.\u00a0 Please peruse some of this before class on Wednesday.\u00a0 I apologize for the late notice!   http://138.23.124.165/exhibitions/sightunseen/exh_essay_01_1.htm             Posted on March 29, 2015  Author Georgia Krantz  Leave a comment                  Learning to See Data          An interesting article on perceptual learning   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/sunday-review/learning-to-see-data.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=c-column-top-span-region&amp;region=c-column-top-span-region&amp;WT.nav=c-column-top-span-region             Posted on March 29, 2015  Author Georgia Krantz  Leave a comment                  Touch tours in Madrid          Thanks for the heads up, Fatima!
