Located at the northern edge of the site, at some distance from the      ancient civic center, its imposing marble auditorium is 270 meters in      length and had 30 tiers of seating with space for 30,000 people, making      it the single best preserved ancient stadium and also one of the largest.      In aesthetic terms, the building exhibits a striking combination of      both grandeur and austerity.      In 1993 a thorough architectural and archaeological documentation of      the Stadium was begun by myself and my collaborator, Andrew Leung of      the University of Pennsylvania. We have produced a plan of the building,      and are now generating a series of detailed drawings, including a state      plan (at a scale of 1:50) of the cavea which comprises 40 wedges of      seating.      The state plan is deignd to capture a permanent record of the seats      of the Stadium which are covered with cuttings for awnings, masons'      marks, as well as inscriptions which reserve space in the building for      particular groups and individuals. These seating inscriptions are thus      an important source of information about the composition of the stadium-attending      populace and social stratification at Aphrodisias. Most notably, the      presence of women's names on some of the seats indicates that the Stadium      was used not only for Greek-style athletic festivals (which involved      male nudity and from which women were therefore barred) but for the      yearly imperial cult festival, which comprised Roman-style gladiatorial      games and venationes.      The Stadium has a peculiar architectural form in that it has two curved      ends rather than one curved and one flat end (the standard type of stadium).      The Stadium at Aphrodisias is one of a small group of such stadia in      the Greek world which epigraphical evidence suggests had a specific      name: &quot;amphitheatral stadium&quot;. This group of stadia was distinctive      in plan in that their short ends that were curved and their long sides      that bowed out&#151;planning devicesthat imparted something of the visually      dynamic shape of an ellipse to the standard elongated stadium structure.      The Stadium at Aphrodisias can be seen, then, as a marriage between      the standard U-shaped Hellenistic stadium and the oval Roman amphitheater.           A combination of stylistic and historical evidence suggests that the      Stadium was part of the monumental building program undertaken in Aphrodisias      in the first century of the Empire. In Late Antiquity the west, north,      and part of the east sides of the Stadium were enveloped by the northern      circuit of the Late Antique fortification walls (mid-fourth century).      In addition, the eastern sphendone of the Stadium was converted into      a small oval amphitheater. Other Roman stadia have small amphitheaters      at one end, but the Aphrodisian example is unusually well preserved      and its chronology is better understood than any of the other examples,      making it important for the investigation of this important feature      of stadium architecture in the Late Antique period.      The Stadium is being studied by Katherine Welch, Associate Professor,      Institute of      Fine Arts, New York University, Andrew Leung, a graduate student      at the University of Pennsylvania and Peter De Staebler, a graduate      student at the Institute of Fine Arts.
