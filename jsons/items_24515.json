The first area focuses on Debussy  and his music--these include sources about Debussy's musical  style, sources that focus exclusively on his piano music and his Preludes ,  and sources that discuss Debussy's place in the Impressionist  movement. The second area are sources that discuss the  contrasting philsophies towards aesthetics in music education,  including my main source, David Elliott's Music Matters .

This text offers technical advice to  students and teachers to play the piano music of Debussy. Using  examples from Debussy's piano works, including La Cathedrale  Engloutie , this text discusses the technique necessary in  achieving the proper &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the music. In  particular, the use of the pedal in Debussy performance is  discussed and analyzed intensively.      Elliott, David James. Music Matters:  A New Philosophy of Music Education. New York: Oxford  University Press, 1995.      This text is written as a response to  the &quot;music as aesthetic&quot; theory championed in the music  education field and typified by figures such as Dr. Bennett  Reimer. It explores current relationships in philosophy and music  education, then offers a new perspective based on Elliott's  concepts, then proposes a new concept of music curriculum for  teaching and learning.

New York: Basic  Books, Inc. 1982.      This book is a collection of essays  that deal with creativity and its development, in all mediums of  art. Emphasis is placed on the aspect of the development of  creativity, and the stages through which one progresses towards  gaining proficiency in the medium. All levels of expertise, from  the newborn to the virtuoso, are analyzed and discussed. In the  area of music, an essay deals with the theories of Suzanne  Langer, from whose philosophies the &quot;music as  aesthetic&quot; idea draws much inspiration.      Gaunt, William.

In particular, the  pianist Marguerite Long and her connection to Debussy's music is  discussed, along with her own pedagogic approach to his piano  works. Finally, the chapter gives a detailed depiction of  Deubssy's personality, idiosyncracies, even his social status-all  of which had considerable influence on his compositional style.

Kivy, Peter. Music Alone:  Philosophical Reflections on the Purely Musical Experience.   Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1990.      Kivy continues to explore the questions  surrounding the philosophy of musical aesthetics in this text.  This book focuses on what Kivy deems &quot;just plain  music...music unaccompanied by text, title subject, program, or  plot; in other words, music alone.&quot;      Kivy, Peter. Sound and Semblance:  Reflections on Musical Representation. Princeton, NJ:  Princton University Press, 1984.      Music philosopher Peter  Kivy's book focuses on the ideas of musical description,  characterization, and expressive musical properties. Kivy  also considers the possibility that music could be a  representional art and discusses its symbolic properties.      Kullak, Adoph. The Aesthetics of  Postive Playing . Hans Bichoff, ed. Theodore Baker trans. New  York: G. Schirmer Books, 1893.      This book is an extensive analysis of  the technique that the author feels is essential to producing  what he deems &quot;beautiful piano playing.&quot; The book  examines a history of the instrument and its evolution and the  history of keyboard virtuosity. It also discusses various  technical challenges the pianist faces in producing a beautiful,  singing tone. Of particular interest is the position of the  hands, wrist, joints, and fingers, which are analyzed and  disusses in every chapter of the book.      Laloy, Louis.

Portland, OR: Amadeus Press, 1992.      A collection of reviews, personal  accounts, and essays the forms a biographic account of the life  of Claude Debussy, beginning with his years as a student at the  Conservatoire in France to his final years before his death in  1918. The entries are penned by Debussy's colleagues, friends,  students, and noted performers and interpreters of his music.  Each provides insight into Debussy's own musical philosophy.      Nichols, Roger. The Life of Debussy .  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.      This is a biography of Debussy's life  that draws an analogy between Debussy and the turbulent,  constantly changing sea. (Probably not coincidentally, Debussy's  greatest orchestral work is entitled La Mer [the sea].  The book charts Debussy's place and influence among 20th century  composers, and stating that his music asks &quot;riddles to which  late 20th century music is still searching for answers.&quot;      Palmer, Christopher.

Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice  Hall, 1989.      This book presents a contrasting  perspective to the praxial viewpoint of music offered by David  Elliott, who rejects Reimer's &quot;aesthetic&quot; perspective.  According to Reimer, a musical experience consists of number of  features, perhaps the most significant being that &quot;Musical  experience requires the perception of sounds as being  artistically (aesthetically) organized.&quot; However, the  concept of &quot;aesthetic&quot; experiences is not necessarily  an elitist concept, as musicality is inherent in each individual.        Roberts, Paul. Images: The Piano  Music of Claude Debussy. Portland, OR: Amadeus, Press, 1996.      An extensive historical, structural,  and stylistic analysis of the complete body of Debussy's piano  works, as well as Debussy's compositional style. The book is  divided into 2 main parts: Background , which explores  Debussy's musical and artistic influences growing up and his  relationship to the Impressionist art movement, and Foreground   , which explores the new directions Debussy's piano music  took in the 20th century, beginning with the Estampes in  1903.      Robinson, Jenefer. &quot;Music as a  Representional Art.&quot; What is Music? An Introduction to  the Philosophy of Music . ed. Philip A. Alperson. New York:  Haven Publications, 1987.      This chapter, taken  from Jenefer Robinson's book What is Music?  An Introduction to the Philosophy of Music ,  features a detailed discussion and analysis of the idea of  musical representation. This is especially useful because  the titles of all of Debussy's works are intentionally  representational, but the fact that the titles come after the  works in the score seems to indicate a more ambiguous intent in  naming these works.

A detailed analysis and discussions of  the pedaling of Walter Gieseking, universally acclaimed as the  greatest interpreter of Debussy's piano music. The essay examines  various Debussy piano works and the intricate, sometimes complex,  techniques that Gieseking used.

A detailed look at the complex  relationship between Debussy, his music, and nature. The  conflicting titles of &quot;Symbolist&quot; and  &quot;Post-Symbolist&quot;, and Debussy's place in both worlds,  are also disussed. Debussy's music can be considered an innovator  of Post-Symbolist thought and philosophy, yet also never  completely sheds characteristics of Symbolism. Because of this,  an apparently paradoxical condition is created where Debussy  falls into a &quot;middle ground&quot; between the Symbolism and  Post-Symbolism. This dissertation addresses this contradiction  and explores the many contradictions that make up Debussy's sense  of aesthetics.      Brown, Jennifer Lea. Debussy and  Symbolism: A Comparative Study of the Aesthetics of Claude  Debussy and Three French Symbolist Poets with an Analysis of  Debussy's Symbolist Techniques in 'Pelleas et Melisande' (Debussy  Claude, Baudelaire Charles, Verlaine Paul, Mallarme Stephane)   Diss. Stanford University, 1992. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1994. 9234041.      In this dissertation, the aesthetic  ideals of Debussy and his music as described by the author are  likened to the concurrent Symbolist movement in France. This  study discusses the aesthetics and Symbolist techniques of three  poets--Baudledaire, Verlaine, and Mallarme, and compares them to  the corresponding aesthetics and techniques found in Debussy's  compositions.      Carlson, Paul. Early Interpretation  of Debussy's Piano Music . Diss. Boston University, 1998. Ann  Arbor: UMI, 1998. 9828247.      This dissertation examines the  innovative piano style, which, based on traditional French  pianism, had a new emphasis on sonority and the technique used to  produce his desired effect. It examines the early attempts at  interpreting Debussy's piano works and creating this  &quot;new&quot; sound. Included is a brief discussion of the  different types of pianos that musicians in Debussy's time used,  as well as an analysis of Debussy's own recordings of his works  on the Welte-Mignon reproducing piano.      Clevenger, John  Robert.  The Origins of Debussy's Style.   Diss. University of Rochester, Eastman School of Music,  2002. Ann Arbor: UMI, 2002. 3045247.      A study of Claude  Debussy's compositional styles and its development and origins  while he was a student at the Paris Conservatoire. This  dissertation focuses on Debussy's musical style as a student, and  is divided into two main parts. Part one focuses on his  Conservatoire training, from which Debussy's music was to be a  radical departure, as Debussy was in a constant struggle with  instituionally-entrenched styles of his elders. Part two  examines all of the 61 works that Debussy composed, while  comparing them to representative works of the French  milieu.       Frantz, Charles  Frederick. Fin de Siecle Visual Art and  Debussy's Music: New Paths for Analysis and Interpretation.   Diss. Rutgers University, 1997. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1997. 9717428.      Frantz examines the similarities  in the aesthetic intentions and results between Debussy's music  and much of the fin-de-siecle art to which Debussy undoubtedly  had constant exposure. This dissertation defines and  analyzes the notion of abstraction and reveals how individual  elements and intrinsic qualities such as color, line, and texture  were emphasized at the expense of the object as a whole.   Frantz then applies this concept into Debussy's music.      Gingerich, Carol Joy. The  French Piano Style of Faure and Debussy: Cultural Aesthetics,  Performance Style Characteristics, and Pedagogical Implications.   Diss. Columbia University Teachers College, 1996. Ann Arbor: UMI,  1996. 9635976.      This dissertation explores the French  style of piano performance and distinguishes it two other main  national styles, German and Russian. Gingerich discusses the  difficulties that abound in performing the French style in an  authentic manner. She also discusses the &quot;common aesthetic  values&quot; that shaped all art forms in France from 1880-1920,  including French piano music. Finally this dissertation explores  pedagogical practices unique to the French piano style, referring  to piano compositions by Faure and Debussy as examples.      O'Stten, William Timothy.

Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical  College, 1997. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1997. 9808768.      This dissertation takes a structural  approach to examining Debussy's Preludes. It discusses two  guidelines that are vital to correct interpretation of Debussy's  music: 1) an examination of all elements of musical structure and  2) use of multiple perspectives in analyzing the music. The  dissertation also compares and contrasts Debussy's own recording  of his Preludes with some of his contemporaries.           RECORDINGS      Debussy, Claude.

According to Reimer, a musical experience consists of number of  features, perhaps the most significant being that &quot;Musical  experience requires the perception of sounds as being  artistically (aesthetically) organized.&quot; However, the  concept of &quot;aesthetic&quot; experiences is not necessarily  an elitist concept, as musicality is inherent in each individual.        Roberts, Paul. Images: The Piano  Music of Claude Debussy. Portland, OR: Amadeus, Press, 1996.      An extensive historical, structural,  and stylistic analysis of the complete body of Debussy's piano  works, as well as Debussy's compositional style. The book is  divided into 2 main parts: Background , which explores  Debussy's musical and artistic influences growing up and his  relationship to the Impressionist art movement, and Foreground   , which explores the new directions Debussy's piano music  took in the 20th century, beginning with the Estampes in  1903.      Robinson, Jenefer. &quot;Music as a  Representional Art.&quot; What is Music? An Introduction to  the Philosophy of Music . ed. Philip A. Alperson. New York:  Haven Publications, 1987.      This chapter, taken  from Jenefer Robinson's book What is Music?  An Introduction to the Philosophy of Music ,  features a detailed discussion and analysis of the idea of  musical representation. This is especially useful because  the titles of all of Debussy's works are intentionally  representational, but the fact that the titles come after the  works in the score seems to indicate a more ambiguous intent in  naming these works.

A detailed analysis and discussions of  the pedaling of Walter Gieseking, universally acclaimed as the  greatest interpreter of Debussy's piano music. The essay examines  various Debussy piano works and the intricate, sometimes complex,  techniques that Gieseking used.

A detailed look at the complex  relationship between Debussy, his music, and nature. The  conflicting titles of &quot;Symbolist&quot; and  &quot;Post-Symbolist&quot;, and Debussy's place in both worlds,  are also disussed. Debussy's music can be considered an innovator  of Post-Symbolist thought and philosophy, yet also never  completely sheds characteristics of Symbolism. Because of this,  an apparently paradoxical condition is created where Debussy  falls into a &quot;middle ground&quot; between the Symbolism and  Post-Symbolism. This dissertation addresses this contradiction  and explores the many contradictions that make up Debussy's sense  of aesthetics.      Brown, Jennifer Lea. Debussy and  Symbolism: A Comparative Study of the Aesthetics of Claude  Debussy and Three French Symbolist Poets with an Analysis of  Debussy's Symbolist Techniques in 'Pelleas et Melisande' (Debussy  Claude, Baudelaire Charles, Verlaine Paul, Mallarme Stephane)   Diss. Stanford University, 1992. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1994. 9234041.      In this dissertation, the aesthetic  ideals of Debussy and his music as described by the author are  likened to the concurrent Symbolist movement in France. This  study discusses the aesthetics and Symbolist techniques of three  poets--Baudledaire, Verlaine, and Mallarme, and compares them to  the corresponding aesthetics and techniques found in Debussy's  compositions.      Carlson, Paul. Early Interpretation  of Debussy's Piano Music . Diss. Boston University, 1998. Ann  Arbor: UMI, 1998. 9828247.      This dissertation examines the  innovative piano style, which, based on traditional French  pianism, had a new emphasis on sonority and the technique used to  produce his desired effect. It examines the early attempts at  interpreting Debussy's piano works and creating this  &quot;new&quot; sound. Included is a brief discussion of the  different types of pianos that musicians in Debussy's time used,  as well as an analysis of Debussy's own recordings of his works  on the Welte-Mignon reproducing piano.      Clevenger, John  Robert.  The Origins of Debussy's Style.   Diss. University of Rochester, Eastman School of Music,  2002. Ann Arbor: UMI, 2002. 3045247.      A study of Claude  Debussy's compositional styles and its development and origins  while he was a student at the Paris Conservatoire. This  dissertation focuses on Debussy's musical style as a student, and  is divided into two main parts. Part one focuses on his  Conservatoire training, from which Debussy's music was to be a  radical departure, as Debussy was in a constant struggle with  instituionally-entrenched styles of his elders. Part two  examines all of the 61 works that Debussy composed, while  comparing them to representative works of the French  milieu.       Frantz, Charles  Frederick. Fin de Siecle Visual Art and  Debussy's Music: New Paths for Analysis and Interpretation.   Diss. Rutgers University, 1997. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1997. 9717428.      Frantz examines the similarities  in the aesthetic intentions and results between Debussy's music  and much of the fin-de-siecle art to which Debussy undoubtedly  had constant exposure. This dissertation defines and  analyzes the notion of abstraction and reveals how individual  elements and intrinsic qualities such as color, line, and texture  were emphasized at the expense of the object as a whole.   Frantz then applies this concept into Debussy's music.      Gingerich, Carol Joy. The  French Piano Style of Faure and Debussy: Cultural Aesthetics,  Performance Style Characteristics, and Pedagogical Implications.   Diss. Columbia University Teachers College, 1996. Ann Arbor: UMI,  1996. 9635976.      This dissertation explores the French  style of piano performance and distinguishes it two other main  national styles, German and Russian. Gingerich discusses the  difficulties that abound in performing the French style in an  authentic manner. She also discusses the &quot;common aesthetic  values&quot; that shaped all art forms in France from 1880-1920,  including French piano music. Finally this dissertation explores  pedagogical practices unique to the French piano style, referring  to piano compositions by Faure and Debussy as examples.      O'Stten, William Timothy.

Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical  College, 1997. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1997. 9808768.      This dissertation takes a structural  approach to examining Debussy's Preludes. It discusses two  guidelines that are vital to correct interpretation of Debussy's  music: 1) an examination of all elements of musical structure and  2) use of multiple perspectives in analyzing the music. The  dissertation also compares and contrasts Debussy's own recording  of his Preludes with some of his contemporaries.           RECORDINGS      Debussy, Claude.

According to Reimer, a musical experience consists of number of  features, perhaps the most significant being that &quot;Musical  experience requires the perception of sounds as being  artistically (aesthetically) organized.&quot; However, the  concept of &quot;aesthetic&quot; experiences is not necessarily  an elitist concept, as musicality is inherent in each individual.

This chapter, taken  from Jenefer Robinson's book What is Music?  An Introduction to the Philosophy of Music ,  features a detailed discussion and analysis of the idea of  musical representation. This is especially useful because  the titles of all of Debussy's works are intentionally  representational, but the fact that the titles come after the  works in the score seems to indicate a more ambiguous intent in  naming these works.

The growing trend to dismiss the  &quot;aesthetic&quot; concept of music in what he calls a  &quot;post-aesthetic&quot; era, as well as the implications of  the increased multiculturalism of music, are both  discussed.

A detailed analysis and discussions of  the pedaling of Walter Gieseking, universally acclaimed as the  greatest interpreter of Debussy's piano music. The essay examines  various Debussy piano works and the intricate, sometimes complex,  techniques that Gieseking used. He stated that interpretation of  Debussy's music required playing that was &quot;always voicing  with color and singing the melodies spontaneously, uninhibitedly  from within.&quot;      Elliott, David James. &quot;Music as  Knowledge.&quot; Journal of Aesthetic Education 25, no. 3  (Fall 1991): 21-40.      This article is a summary and synthesis  of themes presented in Chapters 2 through 5 of Elliott's text Music  Matters. These themes include a criticism of MEAE (Music  Education as Aesthetic Education) and a presentation of his own  praxial philosophy, the idea of &quot;musicing&quot;, the  processes involved in music listening, and the role of human  consciousness in music listening and music making.      Elliott, David James. &quot;Music  Education as Aesthetic Education: A Critical Inquiry.&quot; The  Quarterly Journal of Music Teaching and Learning 2, no. 3  (Fall 1991): 48-66.      In this article, Elliott presents a  detailed criticism of philosophy of MEAE (Music Education as  Aesthetic Education), championed by such music educators as  Bennett Reimer. Elliott's own praxial theory in Music Education  arose from his disagreement with the concepts presented in MEAE.

A detailed look at the complex  relationship between Debussy, his music, and nature. The  conflicting titles of &quot;Symbolist&quot; and  &quot;Post-Symbolist&quot;, and Debussy's place in both worlds,  are also disussed. Debussy's music can be considered an innovator  of Post-Symbolist thought and philosophy, yet also never  completely sheds characteristics of Symbolism. Because of this,  an apparently paradoxical condition is created where Debussy  falls into a &quot;middle ground&quot; between the Symbolism and  Post-Symbolism. This dissertation addresses this contradiction  and explores the many contradictions that make up Debussy's sense  of aesthetics.      Brown, Jennifer Lea. Debussy and  Symbolism: A Comparative Study of the Aesthetics of Claude  Debussy and Three French Symbolist Poets with an Analysis of  Debussy's Symbolist Techniques in 'Pelleas et Melisande' (Debussy  Claude, Baudelaire Charles, Verlaine Paul, Mallarme Stephane)   Diss. Stanford University, 1992. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1994. 9234041.      In this dissertation, the aesthetic  ideals of Debussy and his music as described by the author are  likened to the concurrent Symbolist movement in France. This  study discusses the aesthetics and Symbolist techniques of three  poets--Baudledaire, Verlaine, and Mallarme, and compares them to  the corresponding aesthetics and techniques found in Debussy's  compositions.      Carlson, Paul. Early Interpretation  of Debussy's Piano Music . Diss. Boston University, 1998. Ann  Arbor: UMI, 1998. 9828247.      This dissertation examines the  innovative piano style, which, based on traditional French  pianism, had a new emphasis on sonority and the technique used to  produce his desired effect. It examines the early attempts at  interpreting Debussy's piano works and creating this  &quot;new&quot; sound. Included is a brief discussion of the  different types of pianos that musicians in Debussy's time used,  as well as an analysis of Debussy's own recordings of his works  on the Welte-Mignon reproducing piano.      Clevenger, John  Robert.  The Origins of Debussy's Style.   Diss. University of Rochester, Eastman School of Music,  2002. Ann Arbor: UMI, 2002. 3045247.      A study of Claude  Debussy's compositional styles and its development and origins  while he was a student at the Paris Conservatoire. This  dissertation focuses on Debussy's musical style as a student, and  is divided into two main parts. Part one focuses on his  Conservatoire training, from which Debussy's music was to be a  radical departure, as Debussy was in a constant struggle with  instituionally-entrenched styles of his elders. Part two  examines all of the 61 works that Debussy composed, while  comparing them to representative works of the French  milieu.       Frantz, Charles  Frederick. Fin de Siecle Visual Art and  Debussy's Music: New Paths for Analysis and Interpretation.   Diss. Rutgers University, 1997. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1997. 9717428.      Frantz examines the similarities  in the aesthetic intentions and results between Debussy's music  and much of the fin-de-siecle art to which Debussy undoubtedly  had constant exposure. This dissertation defines and  analyzes the notion of abstraction and reveals how individual  elements and intrinsic qualities such as color, line, and texture  were emphasized at the expense of the object as a whole.   Frantz then applies this concept into Debussy's music.      Gingerich, Carol Joy. The  French Piano Style of Faure and Debussy: Cultural Aesthetics,  Performance Style Characteristics, and Pedagogical Implications.   Diss. Columbia University Teachers College, 1996. Ann Arbor: UMI,  1996. 9635976.      This dissertation explores the French  style of piano performance and distinguishes it two other main  national styles, German and Russian. Gingerich discusses the  difficulties that abound in performing the French style in an  authentic manner. She also discusses the &quot;common aesthetic  values&quot; that shaped all art forms in France from 1880-1920,  including French piano music. Finally this dissertation explores  pedagogical practices unique to the French piano style, referring  to piano compositions by Faure and Debussy as examples.      O'Stten, William Timothy. Analysis  and Interpretation: Musical Analysis as a Technique for  Performance Decisions in Selected Preludes by Claude Debussy.   Diss. Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical  College, 1997. Ann Arbor: UMI, 1997. 9808768.      This dissertation takes a structural  approach to examining Debussy's Preludes. It discusses two  guidelines that are vital to correct interpretation of Debussy's  music: 1) an examination of all elements of musical structure and  2) use of multiple perspectives in analyzing the music. The  dissertation also compares and contrasts Debussy's own recording  of his Preludes with some of his contemporaries.           RECORDINGS      Debussy, Claude. The Composer as  Pianist-Selections from Book I Preludes. Pierian Recording  Society, 2000.      A collection of Debussy playing his own  works, including a recording of La Cathedrale Engloutie.
