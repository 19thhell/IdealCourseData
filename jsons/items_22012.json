New School in Graphic Design, Parsons School of Design Biography Najma has been a  faculty member at NYU since 2002 where she teaches the Jaipur tradition of  Kathak Dance and Yoga correlating the dynamic interplay of energies and consciousness  through chakra awareness and the cosmic movement of the universe.   Najma originally  studied Kathak Dance, Sanskrit, yoga and tabla at the Bharatiya Kala Kendra,  and Kathak Kendra, New Delhi, India under the guidance of the illustrious Guru Kundan  Lal Gangani and his son, Guru Rajendra Gangani   As a Kathak Dance  exponent of the Jaipur Tradition of Kathak Dance, Najma is known to have  enriched and integrated the great Jaipur tradition of Kathak with elements of  folk and Gypsy dances with an unusual sense of aesthetic adventure and free  form. Her creative repertoire finds expression in integrated compositions with  cross-culture fusion pieces performing to music and rhythms of Flamenco, Sufi,  and the Middle East, and has recently developed a new class reflecting the roots  of Flamenco: a dance journey from India to Spain.   Being active in  Multi-Cultural Education throughout the tri-state area, Najma assimilates  poetry and music from all backgrounds by incorporating Indian dance movements  and sounds shaping artistic communication with her students. Most recent venues  include Baruch College, Juilliard School of the Arts, Brooklyn Council of the  Arts, Queens Library and Bronx Library. Early only in her career, 1989, Najma  was awarded a Letter of Commendation from the Board of Education in New York  City for her work with learning disabled children. And in 2003, she was awarded  for her work reflecting the global influence of Asian cultures by the Asian  Heritage Committee at New York University.   Founder of the Gangani  Kathak Dance Company since 1989, Najma has performed both classical Kathak and  fusion throughout the United States at venues including Asia Society, Museum of  Natural History, Museum of Modern Art, Garden State Arts Center, Lincoln Center  in New York City and has toured extensively performing and presenting and  workshops in England, Brazil, Russia and India.   Najma has on many  occasions performed with the illustrious Espirito Gitana' reflecting the Roots  of Flamenco with great artists as, tabla virtuoso, Badal Roy, at Lincoln Center,  Damrosch Park, in August 2011 and UN Presentation creating an awareness of the  violence in Syria, 2012 and most recently, at LaMaMa Theatre all with rave  reviews.   Aside from her dance  practice, Najma is also a certified yoga teacher in which she reflects the  ancient wisdom of India through combinations of yogic postures and sacred symbolic  dance gestures enhancing chakra awareness. She tours throughout the country  presenting workshops and master classes most recently in New York city, Yoga  Dance workshop Invoking the Tree Goddess, Nirvana Yoga 2010 in which she choreographed  Kundalini Unleashed, Sadhana Yoga Ashram, The Serpent Force.
