Subject headings often indicate the contents of books in terms that their titles do not use, which often may be very general.    Subject headings in online databases are often referred to as descriptors , but they serve the same purpose in locating valuable resources. Using a \"keyword\" search will identify catalog entries that contain those specific terms which can add value to a search; however, the terms can be found anywhere - author, notes, publisher, etc. - therefore there is no indication of the value of the term(s) as content matter of the items in a results list.    Use general subject headings for searching a broad topic or more specific subject headings for a specific text, film, or play. You will find (more) headings specific to the subject category within the left-hand facets in our online catalog, Bobcat. If you want to see the subject headings for a specific title, click on the \"details\" link in the title record.    Critical works are classified and sorted by author's name, dates of birth and death, and the subheading, Criticism and Interpretation. Here are some examples:    Ginsberg , Allen , 1926-1997 -- Criticism and interpretation    Brooks, Gwendolyn, 1917-2000 - Criticism and interpretation    Whitman, Walt, 1819-1892 - Criticism and interpretation    Komunyakaa , Yusef -- Criticism and interpretation    Browning, Elizabeth Barrett, 1806-1861 - Criticism and interpretation                                               Literary Criticism via General / Multi-Disciplinary databases                  JSTOR Provides access to an archive of important scholarly journals, primarily in the humanities and social sciences.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um)  is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author  of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.         Students, in the process of learning, acquire ideas from many sources and exchange ideas and opinions with classmates, professors, and others. This occurs in reading, writing, and discussion. Students are expected&mdash;often required&mdash;to build their own work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped one is courteous and honest; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft.       More specifically, plagiarism is presenting as your own:                   a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;    a paraphrased passage from another writer's work;    facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;    another student's work with your name on it;    a purchased paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Other forms of academic fraud include:       \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.    submitting the same paper for two or more courses without the knowledge and the expressed permission of all teachers involved.    giving permission to another student to use your work for a class.       Proper acknowledgement marks the difference. It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.                                              Avoiding Plagiarism                    This site contains an interactive tutorial that explains what plagiarism is and how to properly credit authors.
