Team Aeronuts\u2019 radio-controlled plane took home second place in the Advanced Class category at the SAE International Aero Design 2010 West competition March 5-7 in Van Nuys, California. The Aeronuts led the first seven rounds of competition, but, like all but one of the teams, couldn\u2019t get their plane\u2019s electrical system to read its take-off distance, a new requirement for the 2010 competition. Their plane did outperform in the lifting challenge. It lifted 27.7 pounds to win the Heaviest Payload Lifted Award.   Concept Zero\u2019s fuel-efficient car placed fourth among the 10 UrbanConcept contenders (40 Prototype cars made up the rest of the 50 cars that participated) at Shell Eco-marathon in Houston, Texas, March 27 and 28. The annual event challenges college and high school students to design, build, and test energy-efficient vehicles. The team that goes the furthest distance using the least amount of energy wins. Unlike the futuristic-looking Prototype-category cars that dominate Eco-marathon, UrbanConcept cars look similar to what you see on today\u2019s road.

A total of 54 teams from around the world competed in the annual aerospace event, which presents graduate and undergraduate students with a real-life engineering design challenge and requires them to devise an innovative solution. The winning NYU-Poly team, the Aeronuts, is the first to nab a top slot for NYU-Poly in six years of competing at SAE Aero Design West. Previous teams scored second-place finishes in 2009 and 2010.   This year\u2019s competitors were tasked with designing, building and testing a radio-controlled plane within specific technical limits and requirements. All competing crafts had to be an original design, fixed-wing aircraft with limited engine size and a weight of less than 55 pounds including payload. Each craft was also required to incorporate a braking system and data acquisition equipment to measure landing and takeoff distances.   The Aeronuts won the Advanced Class category. These competitors focused on designing aircraft that can lift as much weight as possible within the gross weight and engine power constraints while incorporating the data acquisition and braking system requirements.   With a craft weighing just 13 pounds, the Aeronuts achieved seven successful flights with a payload of 25.5 pounds\u2014the greatest payload of any team\u2014 and were recognized for their plane\u2019s remarkable in-air stability amid 30 mph wind gusts at the competition site.   They were also the only team to employ a unique braking system \u2014 known as an airbrake \u2014 that utilizes existing control surfaces on the craft to create drag rather than relying on wheel brake pads.   \u201cThis is an exceptional recognition for a group of students who not only demonstrated strong technical knowledge and tactical skill, but also showed their ability to work successfully as a team to solve a difficult problem,\u201d said NYU-Poly Provost Elizabeth Dianne Rekow. \u201cThis combination of academic excellence and creative ingenuity is at the heart of what we aim to instill in all NYU-Poly students. The team is a perfect example of i-squared-e in action,\u201d she said, referring to the school\u2019s commitment to Invention, Innovation and Entrepreneurship.   In addition to winning the Most Payload Lifted Award, the team took second place in the Technical Design Paper Award for written design plans.   Senior Design students formed the Aeronuts and four other teams to fulfill the project requirements of the class taken by all graduating underclass students majoring in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Other teams are building highly efficient automobiles and a wind turbine. The members of the Aeronuts are:     David Lopez (Team Captain) Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minors: Aerospace Engineering, and Nuclear Engineering   Gleb Dorogokupets (Team Pilot) Sophomore, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minor: Aerospace Engineering   Carlos Diaz: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minor: Aerospace Engineering   John Fank: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering   Eugene Prokofiev: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering   Hussein Saab: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minor: Aerospace Engineering   Jon Starr: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering     \u201cThis team did so many things right \u2014 well beyond developing a great aircraft,\u201d said the instructor of the Senior Design course, Industry Associate Professor Joseph Boroweic of NYU-Poly\u2019s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. \u201cThey evaluated previous NYU-Poly teams\u2019 designs to determine what worked and what needed to be improved upon, and they allowed those lessons to inform their design. Their success is no accident \u2014 this team planned to win.\u201d   Note to Editors: Download photos     About Polytechnic Institute of New York University Polytechnic Institute of New York University (formerly Polytechnic University), an affiliate of New York University, is a comprehensive school of engineering, applied sciences, technology and research, and is rooted in a 157-year tradition of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship: i 2 e.

The members of the Aeronuts are:     David Lopez (Team Captain) Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minors: Aerospace Engineering, and Nuclear Engineering   Gleb Dorogokupets (Team Pilot) Sophomore, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minor: Aerospace Engineering   Carlos Diaz: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minor: Aerospace Engineering   John Fank: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering   Eugene Prokofiev: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering   Hussein Saab: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering, Minor: Aerospace Engineering   Jon Starr: Senior, Major: Mechanical Engineering     \u201cThis team did so many things right \u2014 well beyond developing a great aircraft,\u201d said the instructor of the Senior Design course, Industry Associate Professor Joseph Boroweic of NYU-Poly\u2019s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. \u201cThey evaluated previous NYU-Poly teams\u2019 designs to determine what worked and what needed to be improved upon, and they allowed those lessons to inform their design. Their success is no accident \u2014 this team planned to win.\u201d   Note to Editors: Download photos     About Polytechnic Institute of New York University Polytechnic Institute of New York University (formerly Polytechnic University), an affiliate of New York University, is a comprehensive school of engineering, applied sciences, technology and research, and is rooted in a 157-year tradition of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship: i 2 e.

The 2011 edition of the SAE Aero Design West competition was a windblown affair. Winds reaching 30 mph (26 Knots) were clocked at the Fort Worth Thunderbird Flying Field. Teams from Letourneau University (The Rubber Ducky) Regular Class, Polytechnic Institute of NYU (AeroNuts) Advanced Class and The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Micro Class (Pinky &amp; the Brains) all took home overall top honors.   The three day event, held in Benbrook, Texas was the first of two SAE Aero Design competitions scheduled for the 2011 season. Lockheed Martin hosted and organized the event with the first day&rsquo;s events being held at The Lockheed Martin Recreation Association (LMRA). The last two days were held at the Fort Worth Thunderbird field located within Dutch Branch Park.
