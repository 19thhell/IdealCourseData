(Gallatin Building), Rm. 801        Course Description   Many of our modern ideas about art, literature, architecture and its uses, politics, culture, philosophy, gender, and class derive from the brilliantly prolific period of the Renaissance.   During a three-week interdisciplinary program in beautiful and historic Florence, Italy, students will be offered a total immersion and multifaceted learning experience that is an essential beginning to understanding our modern world through the lens of the Italian Renaissance. This course explores the literature, culture, art, and thought of the Renaissance from multiple perspectives.   During their stay, students will develop and present an individualized project based on their academic interests and background and the ways in which the Renaissance has inspired them. As a quintessential Gallatin experience, the course places emphasis on the cultural and historical contexts from which the literature and art of Renaissance Florence emerged.   Readings might include the works of Dante, Pico Della Mirandola, Machiavelli, and selected female writers, as well as art texts such as Vasari's The Lives of the Artists . In addition, students will study the art of Florentine painters such as Botticelli, Giotto, and Michelangelo in the places where these works were created.   Classes are taught in English and meet four days a week. Throughout the course, students will visit museums and churches such as the Uffizi, the Duomo, the church of Santa Maria Novella, and the monastery of San Marco to engage fully with the art and architecture of Renaissance Italy.   Students are required to reside in accommodations arranged by NYU Gallatin.

Employing approaches from the humanities and social sciences, the program prepares students to analyze the current American food system, its global connections, and local alternatives. The program examines cultural, political, economic, environmental, and geographic approaches to food within local, urban and global contexts.    The MA in Food Studies requires 19 credits in mandatory coursework that covers food systems, culture, and policy, as well as a research component. Beyond these requirements, students can take 21 credits in specialization modules (policy/advocacy, business/social entrepreneurship, media/cultural analysis) to dig deeper into their interests. Our mission is to examine the ways in which individuals, communities, and societies produce, distribute, and consume food. Cities at the center of flows of people, produce, and media products, are the prime locus of our investigations.    Why NYU Food Studies?       Learn from the best. Our faculty , prominent leaders in their field, teach and mentor students, while actively conducting research to stay engaged.    Get insider access. Upon enrolling, students study with food professionals who serve as adjuncts and guest lecturers and are welcomed by food production companies, non-profit food organizations, publishers, public relations and marketing firms, magazines, food distributors, food producers and educational institutions.    Study abroad. We now offer coursework --and a program of study--in global sites like Paris, Hong Kong, Puerto Rico, and Puebla, for students to gain an immersive experience in an international context.    Be challenged . Students learn experientially, taking core and specialization courses, as well as interdisciplinary electives within Steinhardt, Stern School of Business, Wagner School of Public Service, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, or Tisch School of the Arts.    Get ahead. We help students find internships in an array of potential employment sites and place them in positions where they can develop new skills and collaborate with potential employers.    Gain practical skills . The program places an emphasis on the development of critical thinking and research which prepares students for situations they will encounter in the profession.       What you'll learn    Upon completion of our program, students will be able to:       Apply an interdisciplinary approach to understand the cultural, political, and economic aspects of the food system.    Demonstrate their knowledge to discuss with fluency issues related to food sovereignty, sustainability, ethics and culture.    Assess policies that shape the food landscape, addressing questions of equity and preserving cultural values.

(Gallatin Building), Rm. 801        Course Description   Many of our modern ideas about art, literature, architecture and its uses, politics, culture, philosophy, gender, and class derive from the brilliantly prolific period of the Renaissance.   During a three-week interdisciplinary program in beautiful and historic Florence, Italy, students will be offered a total immersion and multifaceted learning experience that is an essential beginning to understanding our modern world through the lens of the Italian Renaissance. This course explores the literature, culture, art, and thought of the Renaissance from multiple perspectives.   During their stay, students will develop and present an individualized project based on their academic interests and background and the ways in which the Renaissance has inspired them. As a quintessential Gallatin experience, the course places emphasis on the cultural and historical contexts from which the literature and art of Renaissance Florence emerged.   Readings might include the works of Dante, Pico Della Mirandola, Machiavelli, and selected female writers, as well as art texts such as Vasari's The Lives of the Artists . In addition, students will study the art of Florentine painters such as Botticelli, Giotto, and Michelangelo in the places where these works were created.   Classes are taught in English and meet four days a week. Throughout the course, students will visit museums and churches such as the Uffizi, the Duomo, the church of Santa Maria Novella, and the monastery of San Marco to engage fully with the art and architecture of Renaissance Italy.   Students are required to reside in accommodations arranged by NYU Gallatin.   Note for Gallatin students: This course fulfills 4 credits of the Interdisciplinary Seminar as well as the Humanities and Early Modern foundation requirements.        Eligibility   This course is open to undergraduate and graduate students of all NYU and non-NYU schools. Students must have a minimum 3.0 GPA and be in good academic and disciplinary standing, must have completed at least one full-time undergraduate college semester before the travel course begins, and must be matriculated at a college or university during the Summer 2015 term.
