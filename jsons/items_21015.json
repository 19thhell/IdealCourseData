ALEX  uses Sakai, developed by a consortium of  Universities. Technologies  used:\u00a0 Sakai   NYUSM  Curricular Management System and Curriculum Explorer DEI has created a system within the ALEX calendar to  collect, organize and report on curriculum topics, learning goals and  objectives, and faculty teaching effort. From these data entered  within each learning activity, DEI is able to map the School of  Medicine curriculum and allow faculty and administrators to evaluate  when and where topics are taught.\u00a0  Education Data Warehouse (EDW) The  EDW includes the continuum of learner data from undergraduate, graduate and eventually continuing medical education. This approach, when linked to our ALEX-based learning  and teaching portfolios (described below), allows us to track the efforts of  our teachers and the participation of our learners.  Technologies  used:\u00a0 MySQL,  Pentaho    Evaluation  and Assessment   ePortfolios The ePortfolio system within ALEX is a powerful tool  to collect quantitative and qualitative data on our teachers and  learners. Individual learners, teachers, and professionals can create  electronic portfolios to represent themselves using web-based software. Faculty and students are able to collect a diverse set of items that  represent learning and experience over a lifetime and reflect on  curricular, co-curricular, and non-curricular experiences and  accomplishments to integrate and enhance learning.

However, you can use the course player arrows to move forward, backward or to pause the course.        8.\u00a0 After you complete the courses, DO NOT just close the windows.\u00a0 Please follow the instructions on the screen carefully to ensure that you are marked complete.\u00a0 For example, at the end of the Code of Conduct class, you must complete an attestation and quiz in order to be marked complete in the course. Each of the compliance courses has a final quiz with a required passing score of 80%.   9.\u00a0 When the course is completed, use the exit link to exit the course. You will return to the OLT activities screen where you will see a record of your completion status and score and a link to print your certificate. Click the Close Record button to return to your iDevelop Home page and repeat steps 6 through 9 for each listed course. When you have completed the entire Learning Plan, it will be removed from your \u201cMy Assigned Learning\u201d panel.   \u00a0   Troubleshooting Access to the Training   If a course will not open:   1.\u00a0This is most likely a pop-up blocker error. Pop-up blockers must be disabled to play the courses.   2.\u00a0If that does not work, click on the system checker icon on the iDevelop Home Page. It will let you know if you are missing a plug-in, such as Flash, that is required to play the courses properly.   3.\u00a0If you are using a MAC and are using Firefox, try switching to Safari.   4.\u00a0If none of the above work, call the Helpdesk (212-263-6868) to create a ticket. Please ask the support analyst to note the name of the course you are trying to access and as many details about the issue as you are able to provide.   \u00a0   \u00a0                                                                                        NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}, {"content": "Courseware and Applications - NYULMC Division of Educational Informatics                             NYULMC Division of Educational Informatics   Search this site          Home Courseware and Applications                           NYU3T: Teaching, Technology, Teamwork  Sitemap    Help:  Frequently Asked Questions  IT Education Apps and Tips  ALEX Help  Comments and Feedback  Computer Based Testing  CURIE  iTunes U  New Innovations  PRIMES  Student iPads  Student Printing Software                    Courseware and Applications           Curricular Management Tools    ALEX: Advanced Learning Exchange  ALEX is a Learning Management System that serves as a central  resource for online medical education content and computer-based  learning activities.

Default compilers, applications and libraries can be set by individual or combinations of Modules commands. Modules are not applications, rather they simply add the location of applications to your environment. You can list the available Modules using the command:      $ module avail   You can load a module, in this case the C/C++ Intel Compiler module, using the command:     $ module load intel/11.1.046   Once the module for Intel C/C++ is added to your shell environment, Intel C/C++ binaries, headers, libraries and help pages will be available to your session.    You can load multiple modules in one line. For example, to load intel compilers and OpenMPI:     $ module load intel/11.1.046 openmpi/intel/1.4.3      You can view the added modules using the command:     $ module list      To see specific module information such as what other modules needed to be loaded first to load a specific module you can use the command module show &lt;module name&gt; . For example, to show more information on OpenMPI module:     $ module show openmpi      To unload a module you can use the command module unload &lt;module name&gt; . For example, to unload a loaded intel compiler module:     $ module unload intel      To unload more than one out of many loaded modules you can use module unload &lt;module name&gt; &lt;module name&gt; . For example, out of many loaded modules if you want to unload intel and openmpi:     $ module unload openmpi intel      To unload all the loaded modules, you can do:     $ module purge      You can use help option to know more information on module command:     $ module --help     \u00a0                                                       No labels                                                                                                                                           Overview      Content Tools      Activity                                                     Powered by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6 , Team Collaboration Software      Printed by Atlassian Confluence 5.6.6, Team Collaboration Software.
