A panel of top thought leaders in politics, security, media, law, ethics, and business critically deconstructed major sports events by asking: Are the benefits worth the costs?   Host cities spend years preparing for the Olympics, the World Cup, the Super Bowl and other mega events, as a means of enhancing their reputation and increasing financial prosperity. Major sports events provide jobs and promote tourism, but also can displace residents, disrupt daily routines, tax infrastructure, and pose serious health and security threats. When the games are over, and the fans and athletes have left, host cities often are transformed. How can we measure the success/failure of these infinitely nuanced events and the ways in which they change the urban landscape? At this lively debate, our powerhouse panel investigated the immense gains and drains of bidding on, preparing for, and then gauging their long-term impacts.   Moderator: Arthur R.

Past Events          Embracing Sports in the U.A.E.: Building Domestically, Expanding Globally    Date: November 19-20, 2014   Location: NYU Abu Dhabi Campus on Saadiyat Island   View Video Clip   Over the last five years the United Arab Emirates has hosted several global elite sports events, bolstering the country's domestic success and enhancing its international identity. In the coming years, the UAE will continue to augment domestic sports participation and infrastructure, engage international fans, and expand media coverage while navigating critical challenges that include gender equality and injury-related health risks. As a timely precursor to the Formula 1 Abu Dhabi weekend, this conference brought together international sports luminaries, leaders in sports business, and top government officials to identify the risks, keys to success, and potential legacies of major sports events in the UAE.   Conference Lecture : &quot;Finding Identity and Thriving through Sports&quot;   Speaker : Omar Nour, Egypt's First Professional Triathlete   Date : November 19, 2014         View Video Clip         Character, Respect, and Civility in Youth Sports: Ending Bullying, Improving Performance    View Video Clips   On June 16, 2014 NYU Sports and Society gathered together high school athletic directors and coaches in the New York metropolitan area for a one-day conference to begin a conversation about anti-bullying efforts that would serve to create effective solutions across communities.   Character, Respect, and Civility in Youth Sports: Ending Bullying, Improving Performance , provided stakeholders with unique opportunities to hear from experts on the causes and the effects of bullying, compare their programs\u2019 efforts toward maintaining respect and civility on and off the playing field, discuss personal experiences, hone in on solutions which can be implemented in sports and school athletic programs nationwide, and develop previously nonexistent channels of communication to head off disrespect and abuse on all fronts.   The event featured a roster of top panelists including star athletes; leading sports business professionals; educators; and school and athletic coaches, directors, and administrators at the middle school and the high school level. Among them were Joe Torre , Fred Wilpon , Mark Messier , Bob Costas , Earl \u201cThe Pearl\u201d Monroe , Teresa Weatherspoon , and Harry Carson .   During the event, the results of a national poll conducted by IPSOS, a global market research company, were disclosed. The poll focused on the public perception of bullying and was published in the form of an infographic.   To download the IPSOS infographic on the public perception of bullying, click here .

MacDougal and Sullivan Streets), New York, NY   View Video Clips   NYU Sports and Society offered a unique opportunity to spend an evening with a trio of beloved, current and former NY Giants, who discussed what it's like to play for this legendary team and how their experiences have affected them personally and professionally.   Today's athletes live in a world where every comment they make is instantly available worldwide\u2014immediate fodder for social media, the 24-hour-a-day sports news cycle, and office gossip. As invincible as athletes appear on the playing field, they often experience a sense of vulnerability and exposure. Harry Carson , Victor Cruz , and Michael Strahan provided an insider's look at their lives and careers; the pressures, the challenges, the bonding, and the expectations of them as leaders and role models for sports fans across the country.   Moderated by NYU University professor, director of Public Dialogues at NYU-SCPS, and NYU Sports and Society founder and chairman Arthur R. Miller, the panel explored how these three world-class athletes deal with the difficult decisions and challenging circumstances that are the result of their extraordinary gifts, remarkable careers, and resultant fame. This spirited dialogue focused on how three generations of Super Bowl champions strive to build a lasting legacy of integrity, leadership, and sportsmanship.   Moderator: Arthur R. Miller   Panelists: Harry Carson , Victor Cruz , Michael Strahan     View Video Clips         48 Hours Before Super Bowl XLVIII: The Lasting Impact of Sports' Greatest Events (Free)    Date: January 31, 2014   Location: Rosenthal Pavilion, NYU Kimmel Center for University Life   60 Washington Square South (10th Floor), New York, NY   View Video Clips   NYU Sports and Society , in cooperation with GlideSlope \u2014management advisors focused solely on the business of global sport\u2014explored the lasting impact of sports' greatest events on urban environments. A panel of top thought leaders in politics, security, media, law, ethics, and business critically deconstructed major sports events by asking: Are the benefits worth the costs?   Host cities spend years preparing for the Olympics, the World Cup, the Super Bowl and other mega events, as a means of enhancing their reputation and increasing financial prosperity. Major sports events provide jobs and promote tourism, but also can displace residents, disrupt daily routines, tax infrastructure, and pose serious health and security threats. When the games are over, and the fans and athletes have left, host cities often are transformed. How can we measure the success/failure of these infinitely nuanced events and the ways in which they change the urban landscape? At this lively debate, our powerhouse panel investigated the immense gains and drains of bidding on, preparing for, and then gauging their long-term impacts.   Moderator: Arthur R. Miller   Panelists: Lisa Baird , Gregory Ballard , Gregory Carey , Richard Florida , Kevin Hallinan , Constantine Kontokosta , Mary Pilon , David Rousseau     View Video Clips         Integrity of the Game: Ethics and Today's Athlete (Free)    Date: November 18, 2014     Location: Rosenthal Pavilion, NYU Kimmel Center for University Life   60 Washington Square South, New York, NY   View Video Clips     NYU Sports and Society is devoted to examining the meaning, the morality, and impact of sports in an intensive and interdisciplinary fashion.

This event hosted a panel of leading figures in sports management, business, ethics, journalism, fandom, and professional playing, and cut to the heart of ethics and justice. The panelists assumed the roles of key players in the life of a growing athlete and made real-time decisions on the most confounding issues facing the sports world. These issues included age deception, performance enhancement, responsibility of role models, impact on academics, business corruption, and preservation of privacy and health. The narrative presented actual events that have brought cheating and depravity in sports to the public\u2019s attention.   The panel scrutinized their consequences, including public disenfranchisement and the effects of cheating on youth, and generated alternative outcomes that would protect our love of the games and promote their flourishing. The result provided a better understanding of sports as a reflection and reinforcement of human values and culture.     Moderator:  Arthur R.
