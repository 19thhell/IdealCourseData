How do its ghosts continue to haunt the political present? Can these ghosts be exorcised or does one have to learn to live with them? These questions become especially urgent and consequential in the aftermath of war and catastrophe, as writers and artists confront the legacy of violence and try to memorialize annihilated bodies and spaces. The aesthetic modes they choose to address both the dead and the living and the ways in which they narrate the past have political consequences for the future. We will explore and try to answer these questions by reading a selection of texts (fiction, poetry, film, and visual art) as sites and acts of mourning. Our main focus will be on Iraq, but we will also read works from and about Armenia, Palestine, Lebanon, and the US. Readings will include Benjamin, Boulus, Butler, Darwish, Derrida, Freud, Khoury, Morrison, and Youssef.

Approaches equips students with the means of analysis used in the specific areas of Global Studies that they will pursue in their advanced courses and independent work. Emphasis falls on current thinkers, practitioners, and methods, with some reference to their immediate antecedents. When students choose an Approaches seminar, they are making a commitment to pursuing the concentration in which the course is offered (similar to choosing a major, but less restrictive), since Approaches courses in different concentrations prepare students for different kinds of advanced analysis. Sample Course Offerings ( with concentration ):  Technology, Self, and Other: Modern Literary Theory and Science Fiction ( Arts &amp; Literatures ) Introduction to Theory: Methods of Research in the Global Humanities ( Arts &amp; Literatures ) The Artist-Critic: Imaginative Approaches to Theory ( Contemporary Culture &amp; Creative Production ) Global Corporate Citizenship: Historic, Philosophic, and Legal Approaches ( Histories, Philosophies &amp; Worldviews ) Confession, Torture and the Creation of Identity ( Histories, Philosophies &amp; Worldviews ) Sex and Gender: The Third Wave ( Identities &amp; Representation ) Ethnography and Representation ( Identities &amp; Representation ) Nation-Building, Democracy and Justice ( Politics, Rights &amp; Development ) Global Justice &amp; the Global Citizen ( Politics, Rights &amp; Development )  Global Topics Global Topics seminars are small discussion courses that put topics of contemporary or historical interest into a global framework. They normally draw examples from several of the regions in which the junior year sites available for study are located, but their main purpose is to study the global networks that allow one to understand a specific topic across disparate places; they are not area studies courses, but courses in thinking globally. Emphasis is placed on students encountering the global in the University\u2019s urban setting, as well as in the classroom. The concentration designation provided for Global Topics courses is informational; it is meant to assist students in formulating a coherent program, not to limit their choices. In consultation with their advisors, students may freely choose Global Topics courses outside the concentration they plan to pursue.
