We seek to provide a safe environment for all students, faculty, and staff to grow, explore and deepen their own beliefs and values. Additionally, the Center offers a sanctuary for learning and exploration, and for deepening one's understanding of self, of others, and of the world, while fostering the education of the whole person. The Center encourages students to expand their knowledge within and beyond their own faith traditions. By doing so, students have the opportunity to embrace choices and create meaningful connections within NYU, in their home communities, and in the global community.
