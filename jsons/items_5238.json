The mission of this center is to establish a world-class, multidisciplinary research center focusing on the basic biology of stem cells in a variety of species and cell types.     The study of stem cells stands to revolutionize the practice of medicine. Stem cells have exceptional characteristics that distinguish them from other types of cells. First, they are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long periods of time through cell division. Secondly, under certain physiological or experimental conditions, they can be induced to differentiate or divide into cells with special functions, such as the beating cells of the heart or the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Stem cells may therefore serve a vital role in the treatment and therapy of many diseases. The ultimate goal of the center is to promote multidisciplinary and interdepartmental research within the field of stem cell biology that will lead to findings that can enhance clinical outcomes of various diseases.
