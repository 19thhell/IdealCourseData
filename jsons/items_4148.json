Benson argues that research on public media in other democracies shows that public radio and television deserve support. \u201cThe highest quality, most independent public media systems \u2013 such as those in Germany, Britain, and the Scandinavian countries \u2013 tend to be those that can rely on a steady, substantial stream of public funding,\u201d he writes. Benson views public media as \u201can engine for democracy,\u201d a benefit, he believes that should resonate with lawmakers across the political spectrum.
