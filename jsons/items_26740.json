This course investigates Kubrick\u0092s films in detail with emphasis on their narrative  conceptions and structures. The course will explore the uses of irony and voiceover, the  representation of the relationship between humans and technology, the centrality of the topic of war,  and the relationship of his films to issues of genre.      SECOND SESSION              July 6 - August 15   NYC ON FILM: SUMMER IN THE CITY   Undergraduate Only   CINE-UT 393 c#4950   Michael Bowen   MW, 12:30-4:30pm   This course examines New York City\u0092s role as America\u0092s second \u0093movie capital\u0094 from the time of the  invention of motion pictures right up through the mid-1980s. Topics covered include: New York\u0092s  centrality to the creation of the American film industry in the early silent period; the City\u0092s role as an  icon of modernity in Hollywood movies of the 1930s and \u009140s; and Manhattan\u0092s emergence in the  Postwar period as a center for alternate filmmaking practices, especially independent and exploitation  features, \u0093underground\u0094 experimental films, and early televisual forms such as \u0093direct cinema\u0094 and  live \u0093anthology\u0094 dramas. In sum, the course analyzes a set of generic and formal practices intimately  associated with Greater New York as well as offering an introduction to the City\u0092s rich cultural history.  Screenings include Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Escape from New York (1981), King Kong (1933),  Breakfast at Tiffany\u0092s (1961), Midnight Cowboy (1969) and Twelve Angry Men (1954).

What used to be played on a loop on TV now gets millions of  views online, making the music video a must-have for any singer or band. These 3 to 5 minutes of  content can shape an artist\u0092s career, launch a new dance or fashion trend, and even go viral like  Gangnam Style, the Harlem Shake and Happy. This course will examine the history and aesthetics of  music videos from MTV to YouTube and consider their impact on popular culture. As we view videos  from Michael Jackson, Madonna, Nirvana, Radiohead, Daft Punk, Bjork, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and  many others, we will question the politics of representation at work. We will study auteur directors  such as Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and Chris Cunningham to question the relationship between  music videos and cinema."}]},

June 15 - July 2 (Session IB)   KUBRICK   Open to both graduate and undergraduate students     CINE-UT 206 (undergraduate) c#4946   NCRD-UT 4502 (undergraduate non-credit) c#6764   CINE-GT 2202 (graduate) c#4947   NCRD-GT 4502 (graduate non-credit) c#6765     Bill Simon   MTWR, 3:00 - 7:00pm   The films of Stanley Kubrick constitute one of the most innovative bodies of work in the commercial  cinema. This course investigates Kubrick\u0092s films in detail with emphasis on their narrative  conceptions and structures. The course will explore the uses of irony and voiceover, the  representation of the relationship between humans and technology, the centrality of the topic of war,  and the relationship of his films to issues of genre.      SECOND SESSION              July 6 - August 15   NYC ON FILM: SUMMER IN THE CITY   Undergraduate Only   CINE-UT 393 c#4950   Michael Bowen   MW, 12:30-4:30pm   This course examines New York City\u0092s role as America\u0092s second \u0093movie capital\u0094 from the time of the  invention of motion pictures right up through the mid-1980s. Topics covered include: New York\u0092s  centrality to the creation of the American film industry in the early silent period; the City\u0092s role as an  icon of modernity in Hollywood movies of the 1930s and \u009140s; and Manhattan\u0092s emergence in the  Postwar period as a center for alternate filmmaking practices, especially independent and exploitation  features, \u0093underground\u0094 experimental films, and early televisual forms such as \u0093direct cinema\u0094 and  live \u0093anthology\u0094 dramas. In sum, the course analyzes a set of generic and formal practices intimately  associated with Greater New York as well as offering an introduction to the City\u0092s rich cultural history.  Screenings include Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Escape from New York (1981), King Kong (1933),  Breakfast at Tiffany\u0092s (1961), Midnight Cowboy (1969) and Twelve Angry Men (1954).                                                      July 6 - August 15   MUSIC VIDEOS   Undergraduate Only   CINE-UT 310 c#4952   Sylvie Vitaglione   TR, 12:30-4:30pm   Situated between art and advertisement, between television and experimental filmmaking, the music video sells much more than music. What used to be played on a loop on TV now gets millions of  views online, making the music video a must-have for any singer or band. These 3 to 5 minutes of  content can shape an artist\u0092s career, launch a new dance or fashion trend, and even go viral like  Gangnam Style, the Harlem Shake and Happy. This course will examine the history and aesthetics of  music videos from MTV to YouTube and consider their impact on popular culture. As we view videos  from Michael Jackson, Madonna, Nirvana, Radiohead, Daft Punk, Bjork, Beyonce, Lady Gaga and  many others, we will question the politics of representation at work. We will study auteur directors  such as Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and Chris Cunningham to question the relationship between  music videos and cinema."}, {"content": "Advanced Machine Learning -- CSCI-GA.3033-007             Spring 2015    Advanced Machine Learning      Course#: CSCI-GA.3033-007     Instructor: Mehryar Mohri   Graders/TAs:   Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz Medina .

Or how the intervals between notes came to be?   When were the first musical scales developed or \"discovered\" and how (and why) have they been modified since?    Who were the key innovators of western music theory over the last few centuries?     It is not uncommon for software developers to have an affinity for music. After all, the creation of both software and music is part art and part science.    Further, music and computing are built upon fundamental mathematical principles. While it is not required to understand music theory to be a good player, understanding why we are constrained to a certain set of notes is an enlightening topic - for musicians and non-musicians alike.     This course is for students interested in how both music and software are constructed. Student teams will build software in phases which will demonstrate the underlying rules in modern western music theory. The beauty of software is that it can be applied in just about any domain.     Music students are encouraged to apply even though this course is primarily a software development class. The interdisciplinary product development teams will be composed of at least one engineer and one subject domain exper t who will work together on the assignments. The software the teams build will be used to demonstrate how music theory developed as well as give students an intuitive grasp of some fascinating underlying universal truths...          Pre-requisites:       - Curiosity about music theory   - Interest in building software   - Be either a musician, a music lover OR a software developer (or ideally both)   - Performing music IS NOT required          Objectives of course:       - Pair up in interdisciplinary teams of both subject domain expert and engineer (if possible)   - Learn how the twelve tone scale developed as well as other scales with more intervals.   - Develop educational software   - Learn about big bang moments in music history   - Use language of your choice (Python, Java, C/C++, Ruby) to build software in the music domain - Program on UNIX (either LINUX or MacOSX)                  Week       Topic       Programming Phase        Materials             1 (9/7)        Where is the math in music?          - Set up dev environment - choose language, sound & GUI kit       - Generate 400hz tone for 5 seconds              MSP_lecture1.pptx             2 (9/14)        The Harmonic Series          Implement class using \"living spec\" spreadsheet which shows how the harmonic series can be constructed.
