The curriculum at NYU Prague uses the current political climate to explore the role of Central and Eastern European nations in relation to neighboring countries and the rest of the world, while also considering the unique economic and political history of the Czech Republic.                               Prague is one of the most stable and prosperous post-Communist nations of Europe. With the fall of Communism in the Czech Republic, and with Eastern European countries moving toward becoming fully integrated into the EU, now is a particularly relevant time for students to observe the rapid political changes taking place here.   Students have access to the NYU-sponsored Prague Institute for Democracy, Economy, and Culture, which regularly hosts conferences, seminars, and guest lectures, often on curriculum-pertinent topics, such as the country\u2019s transition to a free-market economy. In addition to course work, students have opportunities to intern with NGOs and law, media, and human rights organizations.

In 1989, a nonviolent revolution by the Czech people overthrew an oppressive communist regime. In the years since, the Czech Republic has grappled with fundamental issues of human society - how to build a just, humane political system that protects human rights and cultural identity while fostering economic growth and social development. At NYU in Prague, students study with some of the architects of this new society.                      View sociology and legal studies course descriptions and syllabi here .

The curriculum at NYU Prague uses the current political climate to explore the role of Central and Eastern European nations in relation to neighboring countries and the rest of the world, while also considering the unique economic and political history of the Czech Republic.                               Prague is one of the most stable and prosperous post-Communist nations of Europe. With the fall of Communism in the Czech Republic, and with Eastern European countries moving toward becoming fully integrated into the EU, now is a particularly relevant time for students to observe the rapid political changes taking place here.   Students have access to the NYU-sponsored Prague Institute for Democracy, Economy, and Culture, which regularly hosts conferences, seminars, and guest lectures, often on curriculum-pertinent topics, such as the country\u2019s transition to a free-market economy. In addition to course work, students have opportunities to intern with NGOs and law, media, and human rights organizations.

In 1989, a nonviolent revolution by the Czech people overthrew an oppressive communist regime. In the years since, the Czech Republic has grappled with fundamental issues of human society - how to build a just, humane political system that protects human rights and cultural identity while fostering economic growth and social development. At NYU in Prague, students study with some of the architects of this new society.                      View sociology and legal studies course descriptions and syllabi here .

The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices.       Spring Semester | NYU Prague    Prague stands at the crossroads of Europe, where East meets West and the past meets the present - a city of present-day political excitement and historical imagery.

MCC-UE 9015 Advertising and Society This course will examine the emergence of advertising as a form of communication, its influence upon other forms of mediated communication and its impact upon culture and society.    MCC-UE 9032 Social Media Networking This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media.&rdquo; We will also work from an expansive definition of &ldquo;technology,&rdquo; considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life. Lastly, the course will also look at the impact of social media on journalism and activism, including a dissection of the recent debates on the power of social media to transform these fields.

In the years since, the Czech Republic has grappled with fundamental issues of human society - how to build a just, humane political system that protects human rights and cultural identity while fostering economic growth and social development. At NYU in Prague, students study with some of the architects of this new society.                      View sociology and legal studies course descriptions and syllabi here .

Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media.&rdquo; We will also work from an expansive definition of &ldquo;technology,&rdquo; considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life. Lastly, the course will also look at the impact of social media on journalism and activism, including a dissection of the recent debates on the power of social media to transform these fields.

Paris has an extraordinary history and is a city of intense national, global and cultural change. You'll acquire or improve your French language skills while exploring the media, art, literature, politics, and history of this world city.    Sample MCC courses at NYU Paris:       MCC-UE 9454 Global Media Seminar: France and Europe This course introduces students to the basic structures and practices of media in Europe and their relationship to everyday social life. It pays special attention to the common models and idioms of media in Europe, with an emphasis on national and regional variations. Specific case studies highlight current trends in the production, distribution, consumption, and regulation of media. Topics may include entertainment formats, advertising and publicity, news and information, content regulation, piracy and independent media, and innovations and emerging practices in digital media. Courses are conducted in English.    MCC-UE 9345 Fashion and Power This course examines fashion as a form of communication and culture. Through cultural and media studies theory, we will examine how fashion makes meaning, and how it has been valued through history, popular culture and media institutions, focusing on the relationship between fashion, visual self-presentation, and power. The course will situate fashion both in terms of its production and consumption, addressing its role in relation to identity and body politics (gender, race, sexuality, class), art and status, nationhood and the global economy, celebrity and Hollywood culture, youth cultures and subversive practices.       Spring Semester | NYU Prague    Prague stands at the crossroads of Europe, where East meets West and the past meets the present - a city of present-day political excitement and historical imagery. This is an exceptionally exciting time to study in Prague, as students from around the world are drawn to this vibrant and beautiful city to experience first hand its reemergence as one of the leading centers of culture and thought in Europe. Courses are taught by prominent professors from Europe and the United States, and include former leading dissidents, writers, foreign ambassadors, government ministers, artists and public intellectuals.    Sample MCC courses at NYU Prague:       MCC-UE 9453 Global Media Seminar: Post Communist Media Systems This course focuses on European media and the transformation of the Czechoslovakian media after the Velvet Revolution in 1989. Czechoslovakian media are considered alongside developments in a broad range of European perspectives in order to acquaint students with the basic features of the European landscape of print and electronic media.    MCC-UE 9014 Media and Cultural Analysis An introduction to approaches and practices used to criticize the content, structure, and context (including effects) of significant media in our society. Background readings, examination of current criticism, and beginning practice in media criticism are employed.    MCC-UE 9015 Advertising and Society This course will examine the emergence of advertising as a form of communication, its influence upon other forms of mediated communication and its impact upon culture and society.    MCC-UE 9032 Social Media Networking This course will examine &ldquo;social media&rdquo; from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes &ldquo;social media.&rdquo; We will also work from an expansive definition of &ldquo;technology,&rdquo; considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life. Lastly, the course will also look at the impact of social media on journalism and activism, including a dissection of the recent debates on the power of social media to transform these fields.       Fall Semester | NYU Buenos Aires    Buenos Aires offers an exceptional opportunity to learn about the history and culture of Latin America while taking part in the lively activities of the day-to-day life of Argentina's capital city.

The curriculum at NYU Prague uses the current political climate to explore the role of Central and Eastern European nations in relation to neighboring countries and the rest of the world, while also considering the unique economic and political history of the Czech Republic.                               Prague is one of the most stable and prosperous post-Communist nations of Europe. With the fall of Communism in the Czech Republic, and with Eastern European countries moving toward becoming fully integrated into the EU, now is a particularly relevant time for students to observe the rapid political changes taking place here.   Students have access to the NYU-sponsored Prague Institute for Democracy, Economy, and Culture, which regularly hosts conferences, seminars, and guest lectures, often on curriculum-pertinent topics, such as the country\u2019s transition to a free-market economy. In addition to course work, students have opportunities to intern with NGOs and law, media, and human rights organizations.

In 1989, a nonviolent revolution by the Czech people overthrew an oppressive communist regime. In the years since, the Czech Republic has grappled with fundamental issues of human society - how to build a just, humane political system that protects human rights and cultural identity while fostering economic growth and social development. At NYU in Prague, students study with some of the architects of this new society.                      View sociology and legal studies course descriptions and syllabi here .
