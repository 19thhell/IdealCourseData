It is also the first Sino-US joint venture university approved by the Ministry of Education of the People\u2019s Republic of China with independent legal person status.   With its 2013 inaugural undergraduate class hailing from all over the world, NYU Shanghai combines the best of Chinese and American education, creating a new kind of higher-education model for its talented students against the backdrop of globalization. Adopting a liberal arts curriculum with English as the language of instruction, NYU Shanghai expects students to spend the first two years on core liberal arts courses and select an academic specialization for deeper exploration and research in their third and fourth years. During their undergraduate studies, students will have the opportunity to spend one to three semesters studying abroad as part of the University\u2019s efforts to create a cross-cultural learning environment that will help students become global citizens. \u00a0   Vision and Mission Statement   Leadership   Statement of Labor Values   \u200b\u200b Audit of Compliance with Labor Standards related to Construction of the NYU Shanghai Campus (PDF)   Compliance by Parties with Statement of Labor Values (PDF)   Photographs of Worker Dormitories (PDF)     Staff\u00a0Directory   Technology Support   Work Here   Open Positions   Getting Around Campus   NYU Global Network   FAQs   Contact Us/Maps   Support NYU Shanghai                                                 About NYU Shanghai Vision and Mission Statement   Leadership   Statement of Labor Values   Technology Services   Work Here   Getting Around Campus   FAQs   Contact Us     Admissions &amp; Financial Aid Chinese Admissions   Chinese Financial Support   US/International Admissions   US/International Financial Aid   Financial Aid FAQs   Contact Us   Welcome Center     Academic Life Academic Calendar   Our Curriculum   Our Majors   Our Faculty   Our Library   Study Away   Academic Support   Registration Services   Non-Degree Educational Programs     Campus Life New Student Programs   Office of the Dean of Students   Athletics and Recreation   Career Development   Getting Settled   Health and Wellness   Residential Life and Housing   Student Involvement   Student Services   Be Safe     Research Research Resources   Research News   Research at NYU Shanghai               Gateways      Prospective Students   Current Students   Faculty   Employees   Community   News   Events / Calendar                        NYU SHANGHAI   Copyright \u00a9 2015 NYU Shanghai.
