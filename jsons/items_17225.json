The major goals of this specialization are to enable students to:   Evaluate and use knowledge and understanding of values and institutional contexts for environmental and infrastructure planning.   Explore theories and historical trends to evaluate relationships between environmental condition, public service capacity, and development options, and their consequences of human actions on the environment.   Understand choices about and ways of balancing the use and protection of environmental resources in urban and natural environmental contexts and in the context of other social needs.   Engage public interests in the process of environmental, infrastructure and transportation planning.

From the Introduction:     &#8220;The ability of a public transportation network to physically link residents to jobs has become a central point of concern for urban policy in an era of uneven unemployment and rapidly changing job markets. The economy of New York City is unique in North America due to its high uptake of public transportation. Here, 56% of the population uses transit to reach work; an individual\u2019s ability to access a job is largely a function of how well their neighborhood is served by the public transportation system. This report presents direct measurements of job access in New York City, and contrasts the levels of access that are experienced in the city\u2019s many neighborhoods&#8230;             To improve economic opportunities citywide, the NYU Rudin Center recommends that policymakers increase the number of transportation modal options across the city, maximize use of existing transportation infrastructure, and foster the ability to work remotely. These solutions will benefit all New Yorkers\u2019 access to job opportunities and economic improvement.&#8221;     Report maps by NYU Rudin Center, linepointpath and Datapolitan .
