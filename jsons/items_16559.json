CEMS faculty provide instruction from an interdisciplinary perspective, including:  \u25aa Political Science  \u25aa History across a range of concentrations: Modern Europe; Eastern Europe;  \u25aa Economic History; Southeast European History; and others  \u25aa Political Philosophy  \"The Center for European and Mediterranean Studies provided, for me, a thoughtful, interdisciplinary environment in which one could explore these subtleties with faculty, peers and visiting scholars with a broad array of expertise. My own research within the history of European integration transcends disciplinary boundaries, and CEMS allowed me to take courses and interact with faculty members concerned with political science and history in addition to economics, sociology and public policy through lectures, workshops and simple water-cooler conversations.\u201c \u2014Stephen Whittaker, CEMS MA 2014               Contact Us | &copy;
