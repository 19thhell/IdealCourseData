Through interdisciplinary panels, performances, and workshops, the forum invites established art makers, emerging artists, and university students to critically engage with spaces on the NYU campus and the greater Washington Square area.   Site-specific explorations have long been embraced by applied theatre practitioners as they collaborate with participants to link performance and community literally on common ground; through participation in such multi-disciplinary encounters, students, community members, and artists may unlock new understanding of the stories imprinted in their surroundings. Moreover, through such collective re-imagining of space, site-specific work moves beyond traditional notions of art and audience, developing nuanced relationships between spectators and space, blurring lines between performers and patrons.   As site-specific performances continue to gain popularity in broader circles and across disciplines, how might we as artists and educators further utilize, build upon, and innovate form while re-examining space as opportunity? What are the implications for artists in community-engaged, educational, and non-traditional performative settings?   Forum Fees     NYU Student Registration: $20   Other Students Registration: $40   General Admission: $75   Daily Registration: $30   Note: Sunday&#8217;s events are free for all STUDENTS     REGISTER HERE   Guiding Questions:   How does space inform, change, and/or dictate conventions of a given performance?   To what extent does space determine audience?   How do we determine which spaces merit performative inquiry?   To what extent does technology inform site-specific performance work?   What can we offer the space as artists, and what can the space offer in return?   What are the educative implications of engaging in and/or developing site-specific artistic encounters?   How are these techniques already present and/or available in classrooms, theatres, and individual practices?   What opportunities exist for audience generation/development?   What connections can be made between artistic skills in traditional performance settings?
