We study homologous recombination (HR), which occurs in all life forms and is an important mechanism for the repair of damaged chromosomes, for rescuing collapsed replication forks, for maintaining telomeres in the absence of telomerase, and for insuring that chromosome pairs segregate correctly during meiosis. While HR is essential to many processes, too much HR is also deleterious, leading to chromosome rearrangements and general genomic instability. We use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study how recombination is regulated and what are the key proteins that limit HR. An introduction and description of our research projects can be found on these pages.
