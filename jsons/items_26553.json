Alternatively, you will gain the requisite technical knowledge to apply to management, marketing, sales and other entrepreneurial activities related to biomedical engineering. Specific objectives of the program include the following:      The program accommodates students with a BS or a more advanced degree in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, premedical, bioengineering and biotechnology.    Students acquire the skills to engage in technological innovations that give people longer, healthier, and more productive lives.    Students choose courses in topics that include biomedical instrumentation, biomaterials, drug delivery, orthopedic biomechanics and devices, protein engineering, anatomy and physiology, biochemistry, immunology, bioinformatics, systems analysis and mathematics, medical imaging and material science.    Giving students the option of doing research in laboratories at the School of Engineering, NYU Medical and Dental Schools, NYU-affiliated hospitals or SUNY Downstate Medical Center. Students may also substitute research credits with course electives.     Admission Requirements   Applicants to the master&rsquo;s program should have BS or a more advanced degree in any engineering discipline, mathematics; or any of the natural sciences.

Students lacking undergraduate courses described above may be admitted contingent upon the student&rsquo;s satisfying the courses necessary for success in the program.   To help students raise their level of knowledge in chemical and biochemical concepts specific to advanced courses in the Medical Imaging or Bioinstrumentation tracks, the program developed 3.00 Credits Principles of Chemical and Biochemical Systems BE-GY 6653 This is an introductory course that is restricted for graduate students who have not had any undergraduate chemistry courses. It focuses on fundamental knowledge of chemical and biochemical reactions. Students learn structure and function of biological molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates and DNA. They master basic concepts of structure-property relationships of macromolecules. Chemistries critical to biosensor technologies such as linking biological molecules to various supports, is described. Students appreciate and understand the wide range of chemical and biological molecules critical to living systems. Prerequisite: Instructor\u2019s permission. . A program adviser reviews with successful applicants what undergraduate courses, if any, they must take. Such courses do not count toward the master&rsquo;s degree.                                            Academic Director        Gene R.
