Talented managers know how to avoid costly delays, how to maximize existing budgets, and how to control a project&rsquo;s scope, among other valuable skills. Our program helps you acquire that expertise and prepares you to be a leader in the construction industry.   In the School of Engineering&#39;s Master of Science in Construction Management program, you will learn management and leadership practices, how to apply innovative organizational, technological, planning, and financial tools to construction projects and programs, and the importance of effective communication with all construction industry players.   Admission Requirements   To gain admission to this program, you must hold a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in a relevant field from an accredited undergraduate institution. You should also have a minimum undergraduate grade-point average of 3.00, although this requirement can be waived if you have sufficient professional experience in construction management. Related undergraduate backgrounds include engineering, mathematics, science, business, management, and the liberal arts. All candidates are expected to have sufficient background in college-level mathematics to allow for successful completion of the program. This requirement will be evaluated by a Construction Management Program Director. Students whose academic and professional backgrounds are deemed to be deficient may be required to complete additional undergraduate courses as a pre- or co-requisite to admission.   Applicants from Foreign Institutions   Applicants from universities outside the United States must achieve a minimum score of 155 on the quantitative section of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and a minimum score of 550 (PBT), 213 (CBT), or 80 (IBT) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).

Foreign candidates who meet all admission requirements, but who fail to satisfy the TOEFL requirement, may be required to take 1 or more remedial courses in English before or as a condition to admission.   Construction Management Certificate Credits   If you have taken courses as part of the Exec 21 Certificate Program in Executive Construction Management and the Graduate Certificate Program in Construction Management programs, you may be apply them towards the MS in Construction Management degree.   Transfer Credits   You must take a minimum of 21 credits at the School of Engineering to be awarded a Master of Science degree. You may request to transfer up to 9 credits of acceptable coursework, as determined by a Construction Management Program Director toward the Master of Science in Construction Management. You need to have taken the courses at an accredited institution and to have earned a grade of B or better in each. Pass/fail courses will not be considered for transfer unless accompanied by a detailed written evaluation by the course instructor.   All transfer credit requests must be accompanied by an official transcript from the transferring institution. Applications for transfer credits are not considered you have earned a minimum of 12 graduate credits at the School of Engineering.
