Angel, formerly an FMLN guerrilla, was a mortal enemy of Nicolas, who was a policeman during the conflict. Now they are both members of the National Civil Police - and friends. Miguel and Vitelio are war orphans, trying to reconstruct a semblance of family life. And Francisco is a happy to lucky bus ticket collector whose primary interests are women and Hollywood. As the film presents the lives of Salvadorans today, it also questions the stability of the calm and asks whether the foundations of the peace accord - controlling delinquency, meting justice, redistributing land, and fighting poverty - will ever be realized. Seven Dreams of Peace is a hopeful and troubling look at the legacy of the war in El Salvador.

PHYSICAL FEATURES: 1 videocassette (53 min.) : sd., b&amp;w ; 1/2 in.  Call Number: VCA 1440  Summary: This &quot;film editorial&quot; reviews U.S. relations with Latin America in general and with Cuba and Venezuela in particular in the early 1960&#39;s. At a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) in San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. uses its influence to expel Cuba from the meeting and sponsors the Declaration of San Jose, condemning Sino-Soviet intervention in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere and the shipment of Soviet missiles to Cuba. Venezuelan foreign minister Arcaya sides with Cuba at the meeting and is subsequently removed from office by Venezuelan president Betancourt. This action spurs big anti-American protests in Caracas. The film then looks at the general dire poverty that prevails throughout Latin American and suggests that such poverty helps foster anti-American feeling in the region. Finally the film turns to Cuba, where we see people whose lives are being changed by Castro&#39;s regime, and also Castro addressing a protest rally of over one million people. The Declaration of Havana was made at this meeting, denouncing the Declaration of San Jose.

All new entering students must register for this course.  Course Description: This course is both a history of the peoples, cultures, and nations of Iberia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and a history and wide-ranging survey of the various disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to the area, including the Area Studies paradigm itself. Some of the readings are included as a means to explore the boundaries of the established disciplines. The purpose is not only to introduce Latin American and Caribbean realities but to review the scholarly, intellectual, and political frameworks according to which these realities are discerned. Latinamericanist and Caribbeanist faculty from throughout the university will be invited to speak about the history of the disciplinary and interdisciplinary frameworks for the study of the region, as well as the prevailing methods in the present moment. Some sessions will be led by guest faculty; discussion in all sessions will be facilitated by student study group presentations. Part I of the course covers the pre-invasion Americas, Iberia, and the production of the Imperial/Colonial world and the \"first modernity\" through the early republican era, the mid-19th century. It also introduces the background to the genesis of plantation societies in Spanish America and Portuguese Brazil, and the contesting colonial projects in the Caribbean region, also involving slave plantation labor, of Britain, France, and the Dutch.    LATC-GA 3200 - Research and Writing Workshop Day/Time: Thursday 10:00-12:30 Prof: Katherine Smith Location: KJCC 404W Course Syllabus Course Description:      This course is designed as a writing workshop for CLACS students finishing their Masters\u2019 Projects. During the semester, students will transform their extensive summer field research into their final masters\u2019 project paper.  In weekly workshops, we will address the essentials of good academic research and writing. Students will participate in peer-review workshops throughout the semester, building on different stages of their thesis projects. We start by evaluating summer field research with strategies for organizing and interpreting research materials and findings. Then, we focus on refining the central thesis arguments and on positioning the arguments within the existing scholarship. In this process, we will continue to build and reshape the literature review/historiography. The final weeks of the class will be devoted to peer-review workshops on outlines, presentations and thesis paper drafts.  The writing assignments and workshops are designed as practical guides to improve research and writing skills in the genre of thesis writing. The schedule intends to keep students on a realistic writing schedule to provide the support and motivation to finish high-quality masters\u2019 theses papers by mid-December 2014.

The course seeks to analyze the dynamics and issues that describe relations between the United States and Latin America since the end of World War II. A complete picture of the current state of affairs in the hemisphere and the reasons that led to it require an analysis in three different \u2013 but related \u2013 dimensions. To cover the first one, the course analyzes historical benchmarks that contextualize particular overt American interventions in the region, dissecting its causes, operation and consequences. In a second dimension, the course looks at topics that have permeated the relationship between the United States and Latin America over this period. Because of their typically cross-national nature, they illustrate a different set of dynamics and concerns that have fueled tensions in the relationship. A third and final dimension concerns recent developments in Latin America that affect and have been affected by U.S. foreign policy. Their novelty suggests that these issues will remain relevant at least in the immediate future. This course is open to all NYU graduate students. Email clacs.nyu@gmail.com for a registration code.    LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 Special Topics: Comparative Racisms in the Americas Day/Time: Thursday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This seminar will explore emergent forms of racism in the Americas as major obstacles to the construction of intercultural relations, racial and economic justice, and democracy. The emergence of these \u201cnew or renewed racisms\u201d is still largely a relatively uncharted terrain in the social sciences. The course will thus explore this phenomenon as integral to the multicultural and what some have called \u201cpost racial\u201d present defined by larger processes of economic and cultural globalization and transnational migration. Throughout the course, we will also look at these emergent racisms in relation to the challenges facing indigenous and afro-descendant social movements, middle class political networks, and state and non-governmental institutions that seek to deepen democracy in the hemisphere by building the basis for active citizenship and racial and economic justice.    The following general questions will guide our analysis and discussion: What is the relationship between institutionalized racism, embedded in the fabric of these societies, and specific \u201cracial eruptions,\u201d which appear to stand in contrast to prevailing ideologies of pluralism and intercultural relations? How to explain the persistence of racial hierarchy in societies where powerful actors explicitly endorse principles of multicultural recognition and racial equality? Does government-endorsed multiculturalism mitigate the negative impact of extractive, industrial, informal and other economic activities on indigenous and afro-descendant peoples? Or alternatively, do these economies actually lay the groundwork for what could be considered a \u201cracialized\u201d economic order? How do the push and pull of migration tied to larger necessities of capital accumulation and labor exploitation shape the dynamics and logics of racism within the region? What types of constitutional reforms, legislative and public policy agendas have emerged to address these dynamics and logics?    DRAP-GA 1048 \u2013 International Studies in Human Rights Day/Time: Monday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This purpose of this class is to introduce students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship to the field of comprehensive peace education. As an multi-disciplinary field, peace education takes a holistic approach to conflict and education. Essentially, peace education is the creation and transmission of knowledge needed to achieve and maintain peace. It is also about developing the critical and reflective capacities to apply knowledge in order to control, reduce, and eliminate various forms of violence. Using a peace education approach, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related normative global standards will be used as the primary conceptual frameworks to guide our inquiries.    CINE-GT 1155 \u2013 Mexican Cinema Day/Time: Thursday, 12:30pm - 4:30pm Prof. Lauro Zavalla Location: See Albert Course Description: Offering an overview of the main film genres in the history of Mexican cinema, with emphasis on the so-called Golden Age (1945-1954), and the first decade of the 21st century. The course will be focused on identifying the forms of representation of Mexican identity through the study of key film sequences. Considering that most Mexican films are not available with English subtitles, the instructor will project selected fragments of specific films to support the concepts and stimulate the discussion. Also, this seminar will be accompanied with Course Notes produced for this purpose. It is expected that each student will write a 5 to 7 double-spaced essay on any film or group of films studied in the course, emphasizing their historical relevance. (Crosslist with CINE-UT 133)      LATC-GA 2304 \u2013 Democracy, Culture and Power in Latin American Education Day/Time: Tuesday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: 404W KJCC Course Syllabus Course Description: Students will be given the opportunity to compare and contrast Freire\u2019s notion of dialogical education with intercultural and multilingual notions in relation to the construction of democracy and equality. This will provide a basis from which to unravel how state officialization of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multilingual Education involved its depolitization through the fading of its historical critical potential. In this light, we will examine how proponents of such officialization chose to ignore critical pedagogy, critical race theory and most of all the contributions and critiques made by feminists and critical gender theorists of education. The seminar will thus end with the exploration of such feminist critiques and those of indigenous women and men interested in \u201ctroubling\u201d the educational arena and taking the legacies and trajectories of Freirean approaches to education and of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multicultural Education proposals a step further.  LATC-GA 2537 \u2013 Latin American and Caribbean Intellectual History Day/Time: Monday, 12:00pm - 2:30pm Prof. Dylon Robbins Location: 404W KJCC Course Description: In this course, we will explore some of the key texts and ideas in the intellectual history of Latin America and the Caribbean. How have Latin American and Caribbean intellectuals approached the problems of culture and difference? How have they theorized the state, civil society, or the public sphere? How have notions of gender, heterogeneity, race and ethnicity, and nationalism related to their historical contexts? A review of texts including \u00c1ngel Rama, Jean Franco, Gilberto Freyre, Marilena Chaui, Fernando Ortiz, Suely Rolnik, Roberto Schwarz, Jamaica Kincaid, C.L.R. James, Frantz Fanon, Glauber Rocha, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, and others.

THE COMRADE is the story of a myth, of a man who became a legend, of a man who embodied a cause. Controversial leader of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB) for over 35 years, Prestes believed in ideals which today seem buried under the Berlin Wall.

PHYSICAL FEATURES: 1 videocassette (53 min.) : sd., b&amp;w ; 1/2 in.  Call Number: VCA 1440  Summary: This &quot;film editorial&quot; reviews U.S. relations with Latin America in general and with Cuba and Venezuela in particular in the early 1960&#39;s. At a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) in San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. uses its influence to expel Cuba from the meeting and sponsors the Declaration of San Jose, condemning Sino-Soviet intervention in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere and the shipment of Soviet missiles to Cuba. Venezuelan foreign minister Arcaya sides with Cuba at the meeting and is subsequently removed from office by Venezuelan president Betancourt. This action spurs big anti-American protests in Caracas. The film then looks at the general dire poverty that prevails throughout Latin American and suggests that such poverty helps foster anti-American feeling in the region. Finally the film turns to Cuba, where we see people whose lives are being changed by Castro&#39;s regime, and also Castro addressing a protest rally of over one million people. The Declaration of Havana was made at this meeting, denouncing the Declaration of San Jose.

All new entering students must register for this course.  Course Description: This course is both a history of the peoples, cultures, and nations of Iberia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and a history and wide-ranging survey of the various disciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to the area, including the Area Studies paradigm itself. Some of the readings are included as a means to explore the boundaries of the established disciplines. The purpose is not only to introduce Latin American and Caribbean realities but to review the scholarly, intellectual, and political frameworks according to which these realities are discerned. Latinamericanist and Caribbeanist faculty from throughout the university will be invited to speak about the history of the disciplinary and interdisciplinary frameworks for the study of the region, as well as the prevailing methods in the present moment. Some sessions will be led by guest faculty; discussion in all sessions will be facilitated by student study group presentations. Part I of the course covers the pre-invasion Americas, Iberia, and the production of the Imperial/Colonial world and the \"first modernity\" through the early republican era, the mid-19th century. It also introduces the background to the genesis of plantation societies in Spanish America and Portuguese Brazil, and the contesting colonial projects in the Caribbean region, also involving slave plantation labor, of Britain, France, and the Dutch.    LATC-GA 3200 - Research and Writing Workshop Day/Time: Thursday 10:00-12:30 Prof: Katherine Smith Location: KJCC 404W Course Syllabus Course Description:      This course is designed as a writing workshop for CLACS students finishing their Masters\u2019 Projects. During the semester, students will transform their extensive summer field research into their final masters\u2019 project paper.  In weekly workshops, we will address the essentials of good academic research and writing. Students will participate in peer-review workshops throughout the semester, building on different stages of their thesis projects. We start by evaluating summer field research with strategies for organizing and interpreting research materials and findings. Then, we focus on refining the central thesis arguments and on positioning the arguments within the existing scholarship. In this process, we will continue to build and reshape the literature review/historiography. The final weeks of the class will be devoted to peer-review workshops on outlines, presentations and thesis paper drafts.  The writing assignments and workshops are designed as practical guides to improve research and writing skills in the genre of thesis writing. The schedule intends to keep students on a realistic writing schedule to provide the support and motivation to finish high-quality masters\u2019 theses papers by mid-December 2014.

The course seeks to analyze the dynamics and issues that describe relations between the United States and Latin America since the end of World War II. A complete picture of the current state of affairs in the hemisphere and the reasons that led to it require an analysis in three different \u2013 but related \u2013 dimensions. To cover the first one, the course analyzes historical benchmarks that contextualize particular overt American interventions in the region, dissecting its causes, operation and consequences. In a second dimension, the course looks at topics that have permeated the relationship between the United States and Latin America over this period. Because of their typically cross-national nature, they illustrate a different set of dynamics and concerns that have fueled tensions in the relationship. A third and final dimension concerns recent developments in Latin America that affect and have been affected by U.S. foreign policy. Their novelty suggests that these issues will remain relevant at least in the immediate future. This course is open to all NYU graduate students. Email clacs.nyu@gmail.com for a registration code.    LATC-GA 1014 \u2013 Special Topics: Comparative Racisms in the Americas Day/Time: Thursday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Description: This seminar will explore emergent forms of racism in the Americas as major obstacles to the construction of intercultural relations, racial and economic justice, and democracy. The emergence of these \u201cnew or renewed racisms\u201d is still largely a relatively uncharted terrain in the social sciences. The course will thus explore this phenomenon as integral to the multicultural and what some have called \u201cpost racial\u201d present defined by larger processes of economic and cultural globalization and transnational migration. Throughout the course, we will also look at these emergent racisms in relation to the challenges facing indigenous and afro-descendant social movements, middle class political networks, and state and non-governmental institutions that seek to deepen democracy in the hemisphere by building the basis for active citizenship and racial and economic justice.    The following general questions will guide our analysis and discussion: What is the relationship between institutionalized racism, embedded in the fabric of these societies, and specific \u201cracial eruptions,\u201d which appear to stand in contrast to prevailing ideologies of pluralism and intercultural relations? How to explain the persistence of racial hierarchy in societies where powerful actors explicitly endorse principles of multicultural recognition and racial equality? Does government-endorsed multiculturalism mitigate the negative impact of extractive, industrial, informal and other economic activities on indigenous and afro-descendant peoples? Or alternatively, do these economies actually lay the groundwork for what could be considered a \u201cracialized\u201d economic order? How do the push and pull of migration tied to larger necessities of capital accumulation and labor exploitation shape the dynamics and logics of racism within the region? What types of constitutional reforms, legislative and public policy agendas have emerged to address these dynamics and logics?    DRAP-GA 1048 \u2013 International Studies in Human Rights Day/Time: Monday, 6:00pm - 9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This purpose of this class is to introduce students to international human rights and the movement\u2019s relationship to the field of comprehensive peace education. As an multi-disciplinary field, peace education takes a holistic approach to conflict and education. Essentially, peace education is the creation and transmission of knowledge needed to achieve and maintain peace. It is also about developing the critical and reflective capacities to apply knowledge in order to control, reduce, and eliminate various forms of violence. Using a peace education approach, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related normative global standards will be used as the primary conceptual frameworks to guide our inquiries.    CINE-GT 1155 \u2013 Mexican Cinema Day/Time: Thursday, 12:30pm - 4:30pm Prof. Lauro Zavalla Location: See Albert Course Description: Offering an overview of the main film genres in the history of Mexican cinema, with emphasis on the so-called Golden Age (1945-1954), and the first decade of the 21st century. The course will be focused on identifying the forms of representation of Mexican identity through the study of key film sequences. Considering that most Mexican films are not available with English subtitles, the instructor will project selected fragments of specific films to support the concepts and stimulate the discussion. Also, this seminar will be accompanied with Course Notes produced for this purpose. It is expected that each student will write a 5 to 7 double-spaced essay on any film or group of films studied in the course, emphasizing their historical relevance. (Crosslist with CINE-UT 133)      LATC-GA 2304 \u2013 Democracy, Culture and Power in Latin American Education Day/Time: Tuesday, 2:00pm - 4:30pm Prof. Pamela Calla Location: 404W KJCC Course Syllabus Course Description: Students will be given the opportunity to compare and contrast Freire\u2019s notion of dialogical education with intercultural and multilingual notions in relation to the construction of democracy and equality. This will provide a basis from which to unravel how state officialization of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multilingual Education involved its depolitization through the fading of its historical critical potential. In this light, we will examine how proponents of such officialization chose to ignore critical pedagogy, critical race theory and most of all the contributions and critiques made by feminists and critical gender theorists of education. The seminar will thus end with the exploration of such feminist critiques and those of indigenous women and men interested in \u201ctroubling\u201d the educational arena and taking the legacies and trajectories of Freirean approaches to education and of Intercultural/Multicultural and Bilingual/Multicultural Education proposals a step further.  LATC-GA 2537 \u2013 Latin American and Caribbean Intellectual History Day/Time: Monday, 12:00pm - 2:30pm Prof. Dylon Robbins Location: 404W KJCC Course Description: In this course, we will explore some of the key texts and ideas in the intellectual history of Latin America and the Caribbean. How have Latin American and Caribbean intellectuals approached the problems of culture and difference? How have they theorized the state, civil society, or the public sphere? How have notions of gender, heterogeneity, race and ethnicity, and nationalism related to their historical contexts? A review of texts including \u00c1ngel Rama, Jean Franco, Gilberto Freyre, Marilena Chaui, Fernando Ortiz, Suely Rolnik, Roberto Schwarz, Jamaica Kincaid, C.L.R.
