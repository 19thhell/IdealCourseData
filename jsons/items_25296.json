Flower remedies will alleviate a Chihuahuas fear of thunderstorms. Paddling about in a pool of water will heal a dachshunds spinal disc disease. Feeding your Siamese cat raw meat will cure her of scabies.    This isnt Harry Potter magic or voodoo: Its veterinary holistic therapy.    Holistic therapy purports to addresses all aspects of a being: physical, emotional, psychological, social, spiritual and environmental. Holistic practitioners pronounce disease as dis-ease. It is the belief that disease comes from an interruption or imbalance of the system.    Thats the way holistic people talk. Disease actually probably comes from dis-ease, said Dr. Marcie Fallek, a veterinarian with more than 20 years of experience as an acupuncturist and homeopath. Our energy should be flowing. And when were sick, its no longer easy flowing; its disconnected.    A Holistic Pet Care Store    If you see it on TV we wont sell it, said Phil Klein, the co-owner of Whiskers Holistic Pet Care, a store in New Yorks East Village dedicated to holistic animal healthcare and natural, organic pet food.    This isnt a typical pet store. Though the usual baskets of plushy and squeaky toys, treats, leashes and cleaning supplies are on sale, theres also a miniature pet pharmacy, with herbal medicine, vitamins, minerals and natural food supplements. Each shelf has an identifying label: arthritis-joint support, urinary system support, dental care, digestion, cardiovascular nutritional supplements, etc.    There are jars of homemade food: Michaels Home Cookin for Dogs: Soul-Stew, one jar says, Ingredients: water, venison, yams. Home Cooked in Pennsylvania. Two freezers are placed near the entrance, filled with giant sausage-like packages and containers of raw meat.    Taped to the freezer doors are letters of gratitude from Whiskerss life-long customers. Hidden in the shelves of the pet pharmacy are three more 3-inch binders filled with letters from customers all over the world: Its not easy to convey the miracle that you worked for Kellie, our Golden, and us, wrote one couple from Ireland.  Klein doesnt claim to be a veterinarian or a pharmacist.    Ive had no formal training whatsoever, he said. Only years of experience.    One customer, who had just adopted a cat from an animal shelter, walked in seeking Kleins help with a diet plan. He peppered her with questions: Do we know how old this cat is? How has he been sheltered?    Then he recommended one. Were not fans of dry food but were going to try and keep him comfortableWere going to start with 25% of the new food physically mixed with 75% of the old food, every meal, everyday for 9 days. On the tenth day, fast the pussy cat water.    Klein sends her off with some homework: a packet of articles and information to read on holistic medicine.    On a lowered ceiling above the registers hang framed pictures of the owners two former dogs: Tiffany-Anne, a black and grey husky, and Tedi-Anne, a mutt with golden-brown fur.    Shes the reason why were here, Klein said, pointing to the picture of Tiffany-Anne. She set the path for this place.    Tiffy, was misdiagnosed by her traditional lifelong vet, Klein maintains. After undergoing a year of unsuccessful antibiotics, drugs and commercial diet food, the vet gave up on her. Klein and his wife, Randi, then decided to seek alternative treatment in a holistic veterinarian. Tiffy wasnt cured, but lived to be almost 13.    After this frustrating experience, the Kleins adopted a mission: to educate others about holistic animal health.    Frequent customer Kevin Carrigan pulled sausage-like rolls of raw meat from the freezer. He feeds them to his four cats.    When a cats in the wild, what do they eat? he asked rhetorically, Little creatures, little birds, mice, salamanders, chipmunks that kinda thing. Are they cooked? Do they come in a can? Are they in cookie form?    Cats dont eat cookies. They dont eat that canned stuff which is the most horrible, nasty tumorous vile stuff that you can get.    Carrigans show of knowledge reinforces what Klein has sought to teach for 20 years. This is not a pet store, Klein insisted. It is an educational resource.     The Hydrotherapy Approach    You wouldnt know she was missing a hind leg. Gracie, a Golden Labrador, swam perfectly. With the guidance of Jean Marie Cooper, a licensed veterinary technician and hydrotherapist, her three legs propelled her slowly through the water, as she panted heavily through her nose.    Water 4 Dogs, an animal rehabilitation center in New Yorks Tribeca neighborhood, provides therapy for dogs recovering from surgery, or suffering from paralysis, arthritis, obesity or joint disease. Outfitted with red and orange doggy lifejackets, a custom-made heated swimming pool and two underwater treadmills, Water 4 Dogs is a therapeutic sanctuary.    Gracie comes twice a week for swims of at least 30 minutes, resting occasionally on the shelf built into the side of the pool. As she sits panting and enjoying her break, Cooper massages her by firmly pushing her fingers against the matted, wet fur of her shoulders, spine and neck.    With her, she has no back leg, so she shifts a lot of her weight to the front, Cooper explained. Her shoulders are really stiff, so I give her a really good massage.  On the underwater treadmill, a dog walks while partially submerged in water. Once submerged, animals can reduce their body weight by as much as 60 percent. The exercise relieves pressure on their joints, builds muscles and prepares them for a quicker transition to land-based therapy.    The Controversy over Homeopathy    Its like an Oh my Godall the time, said veterinarian Dr. Jill Elliot, of the wonders of homeopathy.    The Society of Homeopaths defines homeopathy as a form of alternative medicine, in which patients are treated with a highly diluted substance, or remedy, designed to trigger the bodys immune system. Developed almost 200 years ago, homeopathy has been known to treat both physical disease and behavioral problems, such as fear of thunderstorms or extreme shyness.    The principle is based on the Latin phrase similia similibus curentur, or let likes be cured by likes.    Remedies act on the entire being the physical and the mental. Youre trying to catch the essence of the animal or person and when you get that, you try to match it up with the remedy that has that essence, Dr. Elliot said. Three different cats can come to me with liver disease, but because of their personality, theyll get three different remedies.    [Vets] dont understand the holistic nature of what they do, Klein said.  Holistic vets have often been criticized and ridiculed by strictly traditional veterinarians and non-believers. But as alternative medicine grows more popular, ever more evidence points to its success.    Years ago, when I was one of the first acupuncturists in Connecticut, I was told Anyone who thinks they can treat influx bowel disease with acupuncture is a quack, Dr. Fallek recalled. And now, of course, because its been written up in journals, now they know it can.    I would find some people a little skeptical, derogatory, snippy, disbelieving thought it was magic, Dr. Elliott said.    It is not only the nature of their practice that attracts hostility, but the threat and promise that holistic medicine holds. Traditional veterinarians and pharmaceutical companies feel threatened by the cheap prices of homeopathy, acupuncture and nutritional supplements.    Dr. Fallek described having a patient with a ruptured cruciate ligament, a common knee injury in dogs that may require surgery that can cost thousands of dollars: I put her on a homeopathy remedy, and 10 days later she was healed. Ive had an 80 percent success rate in treating ruptured ligaments with homeopathy. We try to avoid surgery. So why would a vet want me around, really, if I can treat everything with homeopathy!    However, Dr. Elliot, a veterinarian who practices both conventional and homeopathic medicine at the Heart of Chelsea Animal Hospital, has had a different experience: There are four [other] doctors that work here. Each and every one of them respects what I do.    Dr. Elliot tries to balance between the two seemingly clashing approaches. She describes the traditional education she received in veterinary school as the conventional toolkit, and her homeopathic education as giving her some additional tools: And I prefer to use the other tools first if it seems appropriate. It depends on the client. I offer them everything.    However, she doesnt preach her practice: I dont ever try to convince people of anything. I say, give me your worst patient: the one you cant do anything with. Let me see what I can do. And usually I succeed in some way.

As a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) school within an overarching global university setting, the Office of Student Affairs works to ensure the holistic development of each student, both academically and as engaged citizens.   Students must meet the criteria in each area of leadership, service and social justice in order to qualify as an Engaged Engineer. Students must attend qualifying events or participate in a specified initiative to satisfy each area. Students cannot use the same experience to qualify for more than one area. Tracking of these events or participation occurs throughout the year, through the collection of 8 individual Engaging Engineers Participation Forms. At least one event of each component must take place at the School of Engineering.   To be recognized as an Engaging Engineer, the student must hold a cumulative GPA of 2.75 or higher. All participation must take place in the Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters. The achievement will be recognized at the Student Leadership Awards Banquet at the end of the Spring Semester.   Intent to Participate   Students will indicate their interest by completing an &ldquo;Intent to Participate&rdquo; form with OSARC/GSS. In their proposals, students will outline involvement and activities, share the items they may need pre-approval for as well as develop a plan for what they hope to accomplish through participation in Engaging Engineers. Students will also complete a pre-assessment of specific learning outcomes at the start of the academic year. To fill out an Intent to Participate and begin the process of becoming an Engaged Engineer, set up a meeting with OSARC/GSS by emailing nyuengrosarc@nyu.edu .   Achieving &ldquo;Engaged Engineer&rdquo; Status   Upon participating in each of the programs, students must complete an Engaging Engineer Participation Form that shows valid proof of their involvement in said program or event. Eight individual forms must be submitted for each qualifying event within one week after the event/program takes place. All forms are to be submitted to the Office of Student Activities and Resource Center or Graduate Student Services Office. They will also be required to complete a post-assessment evaluation. The individuals who have valid proof of area completion by April 17, 2015 will be recognized as an Engaged Engineer at the Student Leadership Awards Night.   Required Components   The following sections outline programs, initiatives and events that will satisfy each of the required areas. Upon completing/participating in a program or event, the student must submit an Engaging Engineer Participation Form as evidence and respond to prompts to demonstrate how these learning activities have impacted their college experience.   &emsp;   I. Leadership Engagement   Leadership is the process of working with others to create a vision for the future, build commitment and align people&rsquo;s actions towards that vision, and ultimately produce results that make the envisioned future a reality.
