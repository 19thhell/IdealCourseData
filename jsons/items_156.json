It will be held in Florence, Italy, in May 28-31, 2015\u2014as a sequel to five conferences held over the past six years. The most recent conference in the series was held in Paris, France in January 2013, where it attracted over 400 attendees. As on those occasions, the sixth conference will bring together artists and scholars from an assortment of disciplines and practices, including art history, fashion, dance, theater, and studio art, in wide-ranging conversations about imaging the black body. In this context, Black Portraitures II: Imaging the Black Body and Re-staging Histories , explores the impulses, ideas, and techniques undergirding the production of self-representation and desire, and the exchange of the gaze from the 19th century to the present day in fashion, film, art, and the archives. Discussions will focus on aesthetics, vernacular style, fashion, and ethnographics in describing a sense of place and identity. The conference will also invite visitors to conduct a diverse visual reading of the notion of a black portrait while challenging conventional perspectives on identity, beauty, cosmopolitanism, and community in Africa and its diaspora. Through a series of panels and individual speakers, the presentations will include a wide range of discussions relating to the topic. Some anticipated panels and presentations include: Re-Significations: European Blackamoors, Africana Reading and More The Sweetest Taboo: Theorizing Black Female Pleasure, Agency, and Desire within Black Feminism Owning the Hiphop Body: Hiphop Archive and Research Institute (HARI) Representing Blackness &amp; Queerness: the Art &amp; Politics of Questionable Juxtapositions The Black Body in Translation The Portrait &amp; Studio Photographer Who's Black Where  Exhibition This year\u2019s conference will strike an innovative note by including a focus on depictions of the black body within the art collections of NYU\u2019s Villa La Pietra, a historical villa and home of the New York University Florence program. These assets include a collection of sculptures and paintings representing ornamental black images that have come to be known as \u201cBlackamoors.\u201d Embedded within centuries-old discourses, cross-cultural encounters, and artistic productions shaped by migration, conquest, servitude, and exile, these images present a rich opportunity to deconstruct, compare, and contextualize the myriad portrayals of the black body in western societies from multidisciplinary angles. As such, they constitute an invaluable resource to fulfill the mandate of producing critical knowledge of African and African diasporic identities and representations shared by NYU and Harvard\u2019s Hutchins Center. It is in the spirit of this mandate that we seek to invite historians, art historians, photographers, sculptors, filmmakers, musicians, designers, and choreographers to respond to and continue the discussion focusing on the black body in the West as well as the \u201cBlackamoor\u201d collection as a trope.  Conclusion What are we to make of these extraordinary images that have played a crucial role in shaping identities and ideals of the black body for over 500 years? We hope to engage in a discussion that will change perceptions and publish an extensive catalog of the works discussed in order to counter the perceived notions of the black body, and explore ways in which to see how these collected works are viewed as beautiful renderings, as well. New York University is a leading center of intellectual exchanges across all sorts of boundaries whether geographical, cultural, artistic, or disciplinary. NYU\u2019s campus at Villa La Pietra is the ideal location for this discussion as it houses an impressive collection of Blackamoors\u2014a series of sculptured images of Africans in various states of servitude and decoration. In this context, Villa La Pietra is an invaluable resource, providing an invigorating forum for producing knowledge, engaging its immediate society, and connecting NYU\u2019s academic and civic activities in New York City with the worlds of Florence, Italy.

Sadly one has to muddle through some afternoon junk shows like Ricki Lake or Oprah to see a fat and ugly woman strip for the glory of being a pure object of sex. Such courage requires a self-indulgence which transcends a woman's self-consciousness and interpretation of beauty; it is a self-imposed discipline beyond any sexual innuendo.
