About the Sundance Institute Film Music Program  The Sundance Institute Film Music Program connects composers and directors, giving them first-hand experience of the collaborative process, with the goal of nurturing the development of music in film. Each summer, Sundance Institute holds two Labs for composers, one focusing on feature film, the other on documentaries. Both Labs provide a group of talented composers with valuable first-hand experience composing for film. By pairing participating composers with emerging filmmakers supported by the Institute's Feature Film Program and Documentary Film Program, the Lab's two segments aim to enhance the role of music in independent film. With leading film composers, directors, music editors, and music supervisors serving as Creative Advisors, Lab Fellows work closely with filmmakers in a supportive atmosphere designed to promote experimentation and collaboration. The Sundance Institute Film Music Program is supported by Time Warner Foundation and the Film Music Foundation. www.sundance.org/filmmusic   About Sundance Institute  Founded in 1981 by Robert Redford, Sundance Institute is a nonprofit organization that provides and preserves the space for artists in film, theatre, and new media to create and thrive.
