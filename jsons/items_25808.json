Undergraduates    Winter session, or January Term , offers undergraduate students the chance to enroll in one course on the Washington Square campus to allow intensive study of the subject matter.

January Term courses enable students to earn academic credit (major, minor, or elective); to accelerate degree completion; and to concentrate on personal interests.    Please note: These courses are separate from fall and spring terms, and different financial aid and registration policies apply . Please see the NYU January Term webpage for complete information.
