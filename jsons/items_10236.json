Semester: Fall       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This course examines the tools, tactics, and theories associated with the economic revitalization of cities. Explicit theories and implicit assumptions about the economic life of cities will be illuminated through numerous real-world case studies, some of which will involve the instructor's hands-on experience with urban park revitalization and the transformation of Times Square. Through specific examples we will examine how ideas about urban economic development shift across time and place, to better identify deeper truths. While reviewing the standard tools in the economic development toolbox, we will also look at relevant ideas and practices in corporate branding and competitive strategy, managing public space, nurturing creative industries, and changing regulations. Across all categories and case studies, we will repeatedly ask: What are the things that make cities thrive and grow, and how does one nurture those things?
