Friday, February 21st, 2014 &ndash; Saturday, February 22nd, 2014   Deutsches Haus at NYU     NYU\u2019s Department of German welcomes the celebrated Turkish-German author Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar as the fourth DAAD Distinguished Chair in Contemporary Poetics. On the occasion of her visit, this conference reflects on contemporary German literature as a transnational phenomenon. German Studies over the past two decades have been driven to acknowledge shifts within the native literary scene, which has been shaped by Germany\u2019s transition toward an increasingly multicultural, multiethnic, and multilingual society. Engaging discourses of postcolonial studies and transnational literatures, exciting scholarship is being conducted about the changing face of contemporary German literature, a literature which increasingly looks beyond the geographic confines of the German state. \u00d6zdamar\u2019s works have been of singular importance for this shift, and her writings have opened new possibilities for interlinguistic, international, and interdisciplinary exchange. German Literature, Transnational was organized by Alys George, Assistant Professor of German, Department of German, New York University. The conference German Literature, Transnational is generously supported by the DAAD and Deutsches Haus at NYU, with additional support from NYU's Department of German and NYU's Dean for the Humanities.

Friday, February 21st, 2014 &ndash; Saturday, February 22nd, 2014   Deutsches Haus at NYU     NYU\u2019s Department of German welcomes the celebrated Turkish-German author Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar as the fourth DAAD Distinguished Chair in Contemporary Poetics. On the occasion of her visit, this conference reflects on contemporary German literature as a transnational phenomenon. German Studies over the past two decades have been driven to acknowledge shifts within the native literary scene, which has been shaped by Germany\u2019s transition toward an increasingly multicultural, multiethnic, and multilingual society. Engaging discourses of postcolonial studies and transnational literatures, exciting scholarship is being conducted about the changing face of contemporary German literature, a literature which increasingly looks beyond the geographic confines of the German state. \u00d6zdamar\u2019s works have been of singular importance for this shift, and her writings have opened new possibilities for interlinguistic, international, and interdisciplinary exchange. German Literature, Transnational was organized by Alys George, Assistant Professor of German, Department of German, New York University. The conference German Literature, Transnational is generously supported by the DAAD and Deutsches Haus at NYU, with additional support from NYU's Department of German and NYU's Dean for the Humanities. SCHEDULE OF EVENTS Friday, February 21, 2014 6:30-8:30 FILM PREMIERE &amp; ROUNDTABLE The documentary film \u201cGermany, As Told by Writers Christoph Hein, Wladimir Kaminer, Emine Sevgi \u00d6zdamar, and Bernhard Schlink\u201d (Dir.

Director Olivier Morel / Cinematography Sarah Blum / Sound Erik M\u00e9nard / Editing Matthieu Augustin. Scheduled to premiere on the European television channel ARTE in Fall 2014.

Emanines  various intersections between cultural, social, and scientific discourse. Study  of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a  focus on form, genre, and narrativity.          Advanced  Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level)      These courses examine authors, groups of works, and  intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the  development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower  focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination  rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding  than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and  the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German.          Goethe    GERM-UA  455 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Examines  Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose,  poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to  classicism and beyond.          The  Age of Goethe    GERM-UA  456 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Examines  German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and  of classicism. Considers irrationalism, social protest, and Humanit\u00e4tsdichtung as successive  stages of the expansion of consciousness in an age in which Goethe was the  central, but not the only significant, literary figure.

Johann Fausten ;  Goethe's Urfaust and excerpts from  his later dramatic versions ( Faust , Ein Fragment ; Faust I and II ); and Thomas  Mann's Doktor  Faustus .          Literature  of the Weimar Period    GERM-UA  468 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    The  chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with revolution and ended with the Nazi  takeover. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism  to the aesthetics of \"new sobriety\" ( Neue Sachlichkeit ). From the more  traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary  (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period problematize its  subsequent glorification as the golden \u00a1\u00a520s. Readings include works by Brecht,  Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.          Minority  Discourses    GERM-UA  475 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    In  recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of  \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by  so-called foreigners.

(Taught in German) Taught by: Yoko Tawada, DAAD Chair in Contemporary Poetics at NYU &amp; Eckart Goebel Spring 2015 - Wednesdays: 3:30 - 6:10PM           Born in Tokyo, Japan in 1960, Yoko Tawada first traveled to  Germany at the age of 19 where she established permanence residency in Hamburg  three years later. Written originally in Japanese, a collection of Tawada\u2019s stories  and poetry was translated into German and made an appearance soon after in 1987  under the title Nur da wo du bist da ist  nichts ( Only there where you  are there is nothing ). Since then, Tawada has published numerous stories, poetry,  essays, plays both in Japanese and in German and has established a celebrated  career as a contemporary literature author where she is widely noted for her  intercultural style of writing for which she has experienced an exceptional  amount of attention.  Tawada has appeared in over 800 different publications in  several countries since 1987. Among these publications are her novella Inu  mukoiri ( The Bridegroom Was a Dog , 1991;  translated 1998), which was awarded the Akutagawa Prize in 1993, and Yogisha  no yako ressha ( Suspects on  the Night Train ), a series of linked stories, which also received the  Tanizaki Junichiro Prize in 2003.          In addition to her many Japanese literary awards, Tawada is the  recipient of numerous prestigious German literary awards, including the Advancement  in Literature Prize (1990), the Lessing Prize (1993), the Adelbert von Chamisso  Prize (1996), and the Goethe Medal (2005). She has also been a writer in  residence at several universities across the U.S., including Washington  University (2007), Stanford University (2008), and Cornell University (2008).          In  her concise and concentrated texts, which seldom oscillate between poetic,  essay-like, and treaty-like forms of writing, Tawada also focuses mainly on the  exploration of the possibilities and borders of language. Through unusual word  structures and sentence structures, conventional meanings and typically  well-known connotations transform into foreign or even resistive figures, which  demand renewed interpretations of those meanings. Tawada\u2019s literature is  frequently described as an interview of language as well as a creative word  play on styles, sound forms, and complex meanings that serve as new  understandings of language creations. Unlike any other contemporary literature  author, Tawada also redesigns the conception of intercultural poetry with her  poetic style of writing.  Yoko Tawada relocated to Berlin, Germany in 2006 and still resides there as a freelance writer.
