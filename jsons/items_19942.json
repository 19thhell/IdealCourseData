It is the original model for all of NYU Law's colloquia. The Colloquium is now convened by Liam Murphy, Samuel Scheffler, and Jeremy Waldron, two of whom will host in any given year.   Each week on Thursday a legal theorist or moral or political philosopher presents a paper to the group, which consists of students, faculty from the Law School and other departments of NYU, and faculty from other universities. The choice of subject is left to the paper\u2019s author, within the general boundaries of the Colloquium\u2019s subjects, and the discussions are therefore not connected by any structured theme for the term as a whole, though in past years certain central topics were canvassed in several weeks\u2019 discussion. The Colloquium aims, not to pursue any particular subject, but to explore new work in considerable depth and so allow students to develop their own skill in theoretical analysis. Each week\u2019s paper is posted at least a week in advance, and participants are expected to have read it.   The public sessions of the colloquium take place on Thursdays, from 4 to 7 pm, in the Lester Pollack Colloquium Room on the 9th Floor of Furman Hall, 245 Sullivan St. Visitors\u2019 papers will be posted in advance of each meeting on this page.   Students applying for credit:   Admission to the seminar is only by professor\u2019s permission. Students wishing to take the colloquium for credit should send their applications (an e-mail letter with their background and interest in the colloquium) to Professor Waldron\u2019s assistant, Lavinia Barbu, barbul@exchange.law.nyu.edu , between June 1 and August 1. Before you send your application, please check with Academic Services to see if you are eligible to apply.   Students enrolled in the Colloquium meet separately with Professor Waldron for an additional two-hour seminar on Wednesday. One hour is devoted to a review of the preceding Thursday\u2019s Colloquium discussion, and one hour in preparation for the Colloquium of the following day. Students are asked to write short papers weekly, and each student is asked to make two or more oral presentations to the seminar during the term. Each student is asked to expand one of his/her weekly papers, or oral presentations, for a final term paper.

Liam Murphy applies his inquiries into legal, moral, and political philosophy to law and legal theory.            Samuel Scheffler focuses on the area of moral and political philosophy, examining its overlap with jurisprudence.          The Law School has long had a very distinguished program in legal, moral, and political philosophy that has greatly influenced the way law schools across the country teach this complex interdisciplinary field of study. The intellectual values and programmatic innovations of its founding figures, the great philosophers Ronald Dworkin and Thomas Nagel, are evident throughout the curriculum.    Liam Murphy, Samuel Scheffler, and Jeremy Waldron are the public faces of this program, complemented by a faculty with a wide range of specialties. Professor Dale Jamieson, a distinguished environmental ethicist and the founder of NYU\u2019s Environmental Studies Program, teaches at the Law School each year. Among the full-time law faculty with strong philosophical expertise are Professors Anthony Appiah, John Ferejohn, Moshe Halbertal, Mattias Kumm, Stephen Holmes, Robert Howse, David Richards, Lewis Kornhauser, Mark Geistfeld (torts), Benedict Kingsbury (international legal theory), David Golove (foreign relations), and Amy Adler (feminist jurisprudence). The Law School has also hosted a number of distinguished legal philosophers as part of its Hauser Global Law School Program, including David Dyzenhaus, Leslie Green, J\u00e1nos Kis, Wojciech Sadurski, and, for several years, J\u00fcrgen Habermas.    NYU Law offers an array of legal philosophy courses, seminars, and guest lectures\u2014as well as the renowned Colloquium in Legal, Political and Social Philosophy \u2014that presents more choice and opportunity than other top law schools.    Students interested in legal philosophy can choose from a three-tiered structure of courses, seminars, and colloquia. The first tier consists of a series of introductory lecture courses about the following core subjects: jurisprudence or legal philosophy, moral philosophy, and political philosophy. Any given course typically addresses more than one of these subjects. This reflects NYU Law\u2019s conviction that legal, moral, and political philosophy are three aspects of what is fundamentally the one subject.    The second tier involves more specialized courses and seminars. In most years Waldron teaches a celebrated course on the rule of law. His seminar topics range widely among advanced topics in legal and political theory. Murphy has taught seminars on a wide range of topics, including some closely related to specific areas of law such as contract theory and taxation policy. The seminars, generally two hours a week with perhaps 25 students, tend to be more intimate than a lecture course, and require a high level of participation and long essays. In many academic years, Scheffler has offered a seminar in the Law School on such topics as equality and global justice.    The third tier, the Colloquium in Legal, Political and Social Philosophy , brings in distinguished speakers (half from NYU School of Law) who present papers in moral, political, and legal theory, and then are subjected to challenges and questioning from perhaps 40 or 50 faculty and students. Guests over the years have included the biggest names in the field, such as J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Frances Kamm, and Thomas Scanlon. In addition, the colloquium is a for-credit class for about 20 upper-year students who meet with one of the instructors separately for two hours a week to discuss and write about the same papers that were presented at the colloquium. The colloquium will next be offered by Murphy and Scheffler in Fall 2014. Thereafter it will be offered every year by some combination of Murphy, Scheffler, and Waldron.
