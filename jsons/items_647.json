Davis This course will look at how nineteenth-century New York theatre   responded to changes in the city through scholarship and immersion in   local historical sites. While we read about how theatres and their   audiences migrated from lower Manhattan to Times Square, we will tour   the crucial locations of the city\u2019s theatre history, learning about how   theatre\u2019s production values and audience taste changed alongside a   dynamic urban culture. We will focus on how theatre changed from a   largely male recreation to an expansive entertainment industry for   diverse audiences, including women, families, and immigrants, making   theatre the popular culture of its day. Comparing play-going then and   now, we will ask questions such as: What role did popular culture play   in shaping the city of New York? Was the deadliest riot in American   history caused by a theatre\u2019s dress code? What was more important,   attending a Broadway theatre, or walking to a Broadway theatre? How did   P.T. Barnum\u2019s freak shows change theatre-going? In addition to play   analysis and research on star actors, class activities will include a   scavenger hunt of historical locations and a reconstruction of a formal   nineteenth-century ball.
