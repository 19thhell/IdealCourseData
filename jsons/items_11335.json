Their study, which appears in the journal Neuron, points to a mechanism in the brain that allows for this coordination and may have implications for rehabilitation and prosthetics.   Researchers have sought to understand the neurological processes behind eye and arm movements. For example, when you reach for an object, what goes on in our brains so that our eyes and arms are in sync? Such coordination is central to the way different systems of the brain communicate with each other, and these undertakings are surprisingly complicated\u2014due to differences in weight, for instance, the arm takes longer than the eye to move.   The question is vital to rehabilitation\u2014a better understanding of these neurological processes may help address the needs of those who have suffered brain injuries and struggle to coordinate movements among different parts of the body. In addition, new insights in this area could lead to more advanced neural prosthetics, which are artificial extensions to the body that restore or supplement function of the nervous system lost during disease or injury. Currently, these devices are somewhat primitive given our relatively limited knowledge of how the brain works to coordinate movement.   In their study, the NYU researchers examined the neurological activity of macaque monkeys while the subjects performed a variety of tasks that required them to either reach and to simultaneously employ rapid eye movements or to only use rapid eye movements, also known as saccades.   The resulting readings revealed significant coherent patterns of firing of neurons in the brain\u2019s posterior parietal cortex (PPC) when both the eyes and arms were required to move for the same task, but not for tasks that involved only saccades. The patterns of firing were found in regions of the PPC that are specialized for moving either the eye or the arm.   Coherent patterns of firing may be due to these different brain areas communicating when coordinating movement, the research team concluded.   \u201cWe think we have a mechanism for coordination,\u201d explained Bijan Pesaran, a professor in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science and the study\u2019s senior author, adding that the finding is only a step and additional study is likely to reveal a more complex process. \u201cOur findings show it is the patterns of activity in a specific region of the brain just prior to both saccades and reaching that are important.\u201d   In addition, their data showed a coordination of movement between the eyes and arms.   \u201cThe brain adjusts timing of eye movements, depending on how long it takes to start moving the arm,\u201d Pesaran explained. \u201cOur study is asking how information flows between the arm and eye movement systems, and it shows how coherent patterns of neural activity are important to this communication.\u201d   The study\u2019s other co-authors were Heather Dean, a postdoctoral fellow, and Maureen Hagan, a graduate student, in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science.   The research was supported by grants from: the National Science Foundation; the National Institutes of Health; NYSTAR; the Sloan Fondation; the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience; and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.

The model of sex research Masters and Johnson pioneered, with its focus on physiology and the language of function and dysfunction, has led inexorably, these critics argue, to a mindset where sexual functions are seen as simply physical ones, with cures that are pills or creams or gels or patches.\"It's misleading, it leads people to have inappropriate expectations and to make inappropriate choices,\" says Leonore Tiefer, a professor of clinical psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine. \"When things don't go right, I think it's a mistake to rush off to the doctor and say, 'Gee, I'm not happy with my sex life.' \" What worries critics such as Tiefer is the race to develop a female sexual dysfunction drug, a \"pink Viagra\". If successful, these critics worry, healthy women will be medicating themselves to meet a false norm. Women will feel pressure to boost their sex drive through drugs, and risk whatever side effects come with them.   - Leonore Tiefer, Ph.D., associate professor of clinical psychiatry   Learn more:   http://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/the-drugs-of-desire-pushing-us-into-a-sexual-arms-race-20090528-boz7.html   http://www.watoday.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/the-drugs-of-desire-pushing-us-into-a-sexual-arms-race-20090528-boz7.html    Friday, May 29, 2009                                                                                                     NYU Langone Medical Center       Student Login       Library                 Policies &amp; Disclaimers"}]}]
