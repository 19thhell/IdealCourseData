2) to very advanced (Levels 7, 8, &amp; 9) levels of proficiency. CEP classes meet Monday through Thursday for about five hours of class each day.   At the beginning levels (Intro\u20132), all classes are taught as integrated language skills classes designed to provide a comprehensive English learning experience.   At the intermediate levels (3\u20136), instruction consists of two morning comprehensive core classes and two afternoon English enrichment and engagement classes. Both core courses integrate all English skills. At these levels, students select two types of afternoon enrichment and engagement classes. One offers focused practice on a specific language or academic skill, such as pronunciation, vocabulary development, and TOEFL prep. The other invites students to explore a topic of interest and to develop their linguistic and cultural fluency and confidence through engaging in the real use of English. Topics include American film, history of New York City, art appreciation and business English.   At advanced levels (7-9), students complete their schedules with ALI electives, ALI advanced evening courses for specific purposes, or NYU School of Professional Studies noncredit classes. This flexibility allows advanced students to fine-tune their course selection to best suit their interests and needs.

2) to very advanced (Levels 7, 8, &amp; 9) levels of proficiency. CEP classes meet Monday through Thursday for about five hours of class each day.   At the beginning levels (Intro\u20132), all classes are taught as integrated language skills classes designed to provide a comprehensive English learning experience.   At the intermediate levels (3\u20136), instruction consists of two morning comprehensive core classes and two afternoon English enrichment and engagement classes. Both core courses integrate all English skills. At these levels, students select two types of afternoon enrichment and engagement classes. One offers focused practice on a specific language or academic skill, such as pronunciation, vocabulary development, and TOEFL prep. The other invites students to explore a topic of interest and to develop their linguistic and cultural fluency and confidence through engaging in the real use of English. Topics include American film, history of New York City, art appreciation and business English.   At advanced levels (7-9), students complete their schedules with ALI electives, ALI advanced evening courses for specific purposes, or NYU School of Professional Studies noncredit classes. This flexibility allows advanced students to fine-tune their course selection to best suit their interests and needs.
