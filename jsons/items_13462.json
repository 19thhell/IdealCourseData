This tradition   involves defining the actor as a source for expression and   interpretation that is at the center of dramatic creation.    This course delves into the mask work of the commedia dell\u2019 arte in   order to liberate spontaneity, physical presence, and a sense of play.   In recreating the crude as well as the subtle roots of commedia, the   participants work toward combining popular theatre with social   commentary, stock characters with a sense of self, and the absurd with   daily dramatic life. Prerequisites: Acting I or permission of instructor. Tisch Drama majors must complete two years of studio training before attending. Acceptance to the program is by  Auditions only.   Program Curriculum ITHEA-UT 2002 8 units Instructor: Jim Calder Throughout the course, areas of specialty are developed in mask work, circus skills, scene improvisation, individual lazzi (bits and specialty acts), and the search for one\u2019s own clown work. Scene work consists of scenarios, texts, and lazzi from the 17th century, as well as the development of scenarios from present-day topics and texts. Parallel studies of the historical development of theatre and the visual arts in 17th-century Italy and how they influenced each other are integrated with the studio work, creating a larger perspective of the development of European theatre. The course involves students in the local festivals and carnivals and integrates mask makers and specialists from both Italy and Switzerland as it juxtaposes European styles of theatre with American sensibilities.

This tradition   involves defining the actor as a source for expression and   interpretation that is at the center of dramatic creation.    This course delves into the mask work of the commedia dell\u2019 arte in   order to liberate spontaneity, physical presence, and a sense of play.   In recreating the crude as well as the subtle roots of commedia, the   participants work toward combining popular theatre with social   commentary, stock characters with a sense of self, and the absurd with   daily dramatic life. Prerequisites: Acting I or permission of instructor. Tisch Drama majors must complete two years of studio training before attending. Acceptance to the program is by  Auditions only.   Program Curriculum ITHEA-UT 2002 8 units Instructor: Jim Calder Throughout the course, areas of specialty are developed in mask work, circus skills, scene improvisation, individual lazzi (bits and specialty acts), and the search for one\u2019s own clown work. Scene work consists of scenarios, texts, and lazzi from the 17th century, as well as the development of scenarios from present-day topics and texts. Parallel studies of the historical development of theatre and the visual arts in 17th-century Italy and how they influenced each other are integrated with the studio work, creating a larger perspective of the development of European theatre. The course involves students in the local festivals and carnivals and integrates mask makers and specialists from both Italy and Switzerland as it juxtaposes European styles of theatre with American sensibilities.
