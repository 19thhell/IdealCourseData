The major in biology is an integrated yet diverse program that  builds a solid foundation in modern biology through coursework in molecular  biology, cell biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology,  immunology, genomics, systems biology, computational biology, ecology, and  environmental biology. From the very outset of their studies, students are  exposed to modern concepts and state-of-the-art experimental and analytical  methods. Upper-level courses emphasize foundational knowledge as well as  laboratory skills, reasoning skills and quantitative skills. Advanced students  may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the  specialized areas of faculty research.          The  department also offers a set of discrete minors in the life sciences,  specifically in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and  bioinformatics, and environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone  skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory  experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will  meet their unique academic and career goals.          This  program provides outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia,  medicine, dentistry, and related fields. Graduates of the department have a  remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in  establishing notable careers in the biomedical sciences.          Other  courses offered by the department are designed to acquaint non-science majors  with contemporary issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing  problems such as environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human  physiology.          Outstanding  and highly motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors  work, independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other  enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in  faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities  afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important  research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and laboratory  facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These include  undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental physiology,  genomics, bioinformatics, and ecological analysis. Field studies are carried  out at a variety of regional sites. Department faculty are also affiliated with  the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, the NYU Center for  Developmental Genetics, NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the NYU  School of Medicine, the NYU College of Dentistry, the American Museum of  Natural History, the New York Botanical Garden, and Cold Spring Harbor  Laboratory.          Students  with questions about majoring in biology or minoring in a specific area of  biology should visit the office of the Department of Biology. Those declaring a  major in biology are assigned a faculty adviser from the department; students  meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course  selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is also available to  provide guidance concerning the many options and opportunities afforded by the  department for curricular enhancement, including research experiences.            Major  (Bachelor of Arts)          The  department offers two tracks.    The standard biology track provides the major with a broad background in biology  with the laboratory, quantitative, and reasoning skills needed for today's  modern biology.   The ecology track   also provides students with a broad background in modern biology, but with a  focus on ecological concepts, approaches, and analytical methods. In  addition to these two tracks, students may pursue a major in global public  health/science, with a concentration in biology (see below).          In  each of the two tracks, sixteen courses (typically 70 points) completed with  grades of C or higher (and a minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses required by and  taken as electives in the major) are required for the major.          To  permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level courses, we strongly  recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12),  General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and mathematics  in their freshman year. Then as sophomores, students in the standard track  should take Molecular and Cell Biology I, II (BIOL-UA 21, 22), whereas students  in the ecology track should take Molecular and Cell Biology I (BIOL-UA 21) and  Fundamentals of Ecology (BIOL-UA 63).          Programs  of majors must be approved each term by a department adviser.

The  major in Biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid  foundation in modern biology through coursework in molecular biology, cell  biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology, immunology, genomics,  systems biology, computational biology, ecology and environmental biology. From  the very outset of their studies, students are exposed to modern concepts and  state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods. Upper-level courses emphasize  foundational knowledge as well as laboratory skills, reasoning skills and  quantitative skills. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses,  which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.      The department also offers  a set of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of  molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and  environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular  contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors  permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique  academic and career goals.      This program provides  outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry,  and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of  success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable  careers in the biomedical sciences.      Other courses offered by  the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary  issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as  environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.      Outstanding and highly  motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work,  independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other  enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in  faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities  afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important  research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and  laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These  include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental  physiology, genomics, bioinformatics and ecological analysis.

The  major in Biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid  foundation in modern biology through coursework in molecular biology, cell  biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology, immunology, genomics,  systems biology, computational biology, ecology and environmental biology. From  the very outset of their studies, students are exposed to modern concepts and  state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods. Upper-level courses emphasize  foundational knowledge as well as laboratory skills, reasoning skills and  quantitative skills. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses,  which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.      The department also offers  a set of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of  molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and  environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular  contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors  permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique  academic and career goals.      This program provides  outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry,  and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of  success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable  careers in the biomedical sciences.      Other courses offered by  the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary  issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as  environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.      Outstanding and highly  motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work,  independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other  enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in  faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities  afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important  research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and  laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These  include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental  physiology, genomics, bioinformatics and ecological analysis. Field studies are  carried out at a variety of regional sites. Department faculty are also  affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics  and Systems Biology ,  the NYU Center for  Developmental Genetics ,   NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences , the NYU School of Medicine ,  the NYU College of Dentistry , the American Museum of  Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and Cold Spring Harbor  Laboratory .      Students with questions about majoring in Biology or minoring in  a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of  Biology. Those declaring a major in Biology are assigned a faculty adviser from  the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study,  determine course selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is  also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and  opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including  research experiences.      Major (Bachelor of Arts)      The Department offers two tracks. The standard biology  track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the  laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern  biology. The ecology track also provides students with the broad background in  modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and  analytical methods.

Over the past several years, biology has been revolutionized with the development of powerful techniques in molecular and cellular biology, genomics and bioinformatics that are now being applied to research across the spectrum of the science, from genetics and development to biomedicine, field studies and animal behavior. The department\u2019s programs of study and research reflect this contemporary view of biology.    The department offers students the opportunity to explore the various areas of current biology in an integrated yet diverse program that builds from a solid foundation of the basic elements of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, evolution, organ systems and population studies. Students are exposed to modern concepts, state-of-the-art approaches and current methods of experimentation in molecular biology, biochemistry, genomics and bioinformatics within introductory courses taken at the very outset of their studies. A variety of intermediate courses then provides in-depth exploration of major fields of biology. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses, which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.    Three options are available to students pursuing a major in Biology. The standard Biology track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern biology. The Ecology track also provides students with the broad background in modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and analytical methods. The Global Public Health/Science major with Concentration in Biology provides students with strong foundations in biological science and global public health, with a focus on one of three emphasis areas: genetics and genomics, infectious diseases or environmental health.    The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the life sciences , specifically in the areas of:      Molecular and Cell Biology    Genetics    Genomics and Bioinformatics    Environmental Biology          Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique academic and career goals.
