Notify us in case of errors or questions about your bill. If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write to us on a separate sheet of paper (not on your billing statement) at:          New York University     Office of the Bursar     105 East 17th street, 3rd Floor      New York, NY 10003        Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information:          Your name and University ID number      The dollar amount of the suspected error      Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.               Your Rights and Our Responsibilities     After We Receive Your Written Notice      We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days of its receipt by us, unless we have corrected the error by then (within two billing cycles and no more than 90 days). We must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill is correct.      After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill for the amount in question including finance charges. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.      If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.      If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. In the event that our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. We must also tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We are obligated to tell anyone we reported you to that the matter has been resolved once everything is finally settled.      If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.      Your Account at New York University is subject to the following Conditions and Terms:          A Finance Charge will be imposed on unpaid student accounts, from the first day of classes, until the outstanding balance is paid in full. The amount of the Finance Charge is determined by applying a periodic rate of one percent (1%) per month to the &quot;average daily balance&quot; of your account. The corresponding annual percentage rate is twelve percent (12%).      To get the &quot;average daily balance,&quot; we take the beginning balance of your account (which includes any unpaid tuition and fees) each day, we add any new charges to your account, and subtract any payments or credits made to your account. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the &quot;average daily balance.&quot;      If the University refers any unpaid accounts for collection, you will be held responsible for all associated charges including attorney's fees of up to one-third of the balance to the full extent permitted by law.      The University reserves the right to withhold registration material and all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for interest, housing, dining or other activities) or for as long as any arrears remain."}]},

The UCAIHS, which serves as NYU's IRB for the Washington Square units of the University, is authorized to review and approve research involving human subjects through an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Human Research Protections called a Federal Wide Assurance.   See the section on How to Apply to get started with the application process, including whether your proposed work requires UCAIHS review and approval.   Investigators should keep in mind that it is NYU policy that all applicants (and faculty sponsors) to the UCAIHS must take the Human Subjects Tutorial and pass the Certification Exam in order for the UCAIHS to review their application.

Notify us in case of errors or questions about your bill. If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write to us on a separate sheet of paper (not on your billing statement) at:          New York University     Office of the Bursar     105 East 17th street, 3rd Floor      New York, NY 10003        Write to us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information:          Your name and University ID number      The dollar amount of the suspected error      Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.               Your Rights and Our Responsibilities     After We Receive Your Written Notice      We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days of its receipt by us, unless we have corrected the error by then (within two billing cycles and no more than 90 days). We must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill is correct.      After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill for the amount in question including finance charges. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question.      If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay finance charges related to any questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay finance charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.      If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. In the event that our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill. We must also tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We are obligated to tell anyone we reported you to that the matter has been resolved once everything is finally settled.      If we do not follow these rules, we cannot collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if your bill was correct.      Your Account at New York University is subject to the following Conditions and Terms:          A Finance Charge will be imposed on unpaid student accounts, from the first day of classes, until the outstanding balance is paid in full. The amount of the Finance Charge is determined by applying a periodic rate of one percent (1%) per month to the &quot;average daily balance&quot; of your account. The corresponding annual percentage rate is twelve percent (12%).      To get the &quot;average daily balance,&quot; we take the beginning balance of your account (which includes any unpaid tuition and fees) each day, we add any new charges to your account, and subtract any payments or credits made to your account. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the &quot;average daily balance.&quot;      If the University refers any unpaid accounts for collection, you will be held responsible for all associated charges including attorney's fees of up to one-third of the balance to the full extent permitted by law.      The University reserves the right to withhold registration material and all information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for interest, housing, dining or other activities) or for as long as any arrears remain."}, {"content": "Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)                                                                                                   NYU.edu requires JavaScript be enabled in your browser in order to use important features of the site.

I. Background   Among its several purposes, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) was enacted to protect the privacy of students' education records, to establish the rights of students to inspect and review their education records, and to provide students with an opportunity to have inaccurate or misleading information in their education records corrected. FERPA also permits the disclosure by an institution without a student's prior consent of so-called directory information about that student. Students have the right to file complaints with the Department of Education's Family Policy Compliance Office concerning alleged failures by an institution to comply with FERPA. In accordance with the statute and the FERPA regulations issued by the Department of Education, New York University (&quot;NYU&quot; or &quot;the University&quot;) has adopted the following policies and procedures.   II. Applicability   &quot;Student&quot; includes any person with respect to whom the University maintains an education record, whether or not that person is currently in attendance. Persons who have not been in attendance are not &quot;students&quot; entitled to review their records. Thus, persons who have applied to and been admitted by the University, but who have not yet begun to attend classes, are not eligible to review their records. Also, students who, while attending one school or college of NYU, have applied to another NYU school or college, are not entitled to review records of the school or college to which they are applying until they have been accepted and are in attendance at that school or college.   III. Education Records   &quot;Education records&quot; available for review are defined as those records, files, documents, and other materials that contain information directly related to a student and that are maintained by the University. The form in which the information is maintained by the University does not matter; for example, computerized or electronic files, audio or video tape, photographic images, film, etc., with such information are &quot;education records&quot;. This includes communications and documents distributed or received by e-mail, or other similar University systems, which are retained in these systems, either by the sending or receiving party.   In general, records maintained by the University that are available for student review are: recorder's docket, admissions docket, departmental docket, placement docket (if student has a file there), financial aid docket (if student has applied for aid), advisement and counseling dockets from the various schools, and bursar's docket. Not all of these categories of records are maintained for any given student, and there may be others. Students have the right to review original documents from their files.   Under FERPA and its related regulations the following types of University records are not &quot;education records&quot; and are, therefore, not available for student review:     Personal notes or records (including computerized files) that are kept by an individual University employee solely in her or his possession, are used only as a personal memory aid, and are not accessible or revealed to others, except to a temporary substitute.   Records that relate to an individual who is employed by the University and that (a) are made and maintained in the normal course of business, (b) are not available for use for any other purpose, and (c) relate exclusively to the individual in that individual's capacity as an employee. This exception does not apply to records that relate to a student in attendance at the University who is employed as a result of his or her status as a student.   Medical and psychiatric records created, maintained, and used only in connection with the treatment of a student and that are not available to anyone other than the persons providing such treatment. Such records can be personally reviewed by a physician, psychologist, or other appropriate health professional of the student's choice. (Students who have received treatment form the University Health Center or from the University Counseling Services may contact those offices to inquire concerning access to patient information.)   Records that contain information relating to an individual who no longer is a student at the University and that are not directly related to the individual\u2019s attendance as a student, i.e., alumni records.   Grades or peer-graded papers before they are collected and recorded by an instructor.     Also, the University does not have to permit a student to review education records that are:     Financial records of the parents of a student.   Confidential letters and statements of recommendation placed in the education records of a student (a) prior to January 1, 1975, as long as they are used only for the purposes for which they were specifically intended; and (b) after January 1, 1975, if the student has waived access to such letters and recommendations and if such letters and recommendations relate to the student's admission to an educational institution (including admission to NYU), application for employment, or receipt of an honor or honorary recognition (see Section V, Waivers).     IV. Access to Records   At NYU, FERPA is administered by Associate Provost Barnett W. Hamberger (note exceptions below), the Office of the Associate Provost is located at 194 Mercer Street, Room 403F, 212-998-2310. Except as noted below, requests to review records, for copies of the statute or its attendant regulations, or for additional information concerning FERPA, should be directed to the Office of the Associate Provost.   Requests for record reviews at the Graduate Division of the Stern School of Business, the College of Dentistry, the School of Law, or the School of Medicine, should be directed to the following persons:   STERN (Graduate Division only)   Beth Rubin, Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs   44 West Fourth Street, Room 6-100     DENTISTRY   Andrew Spielman, Associate Dean   345 East 24th Street, 10th Floor West     LAW   Michelle Kirkland, Assistant Dean of Academic Services and Registration   Furman Hall, 245 Sullivan Street, Room 474     MEDICINE   Maureen Doran, Director of Registration and Student Records   Schwartz Hall, 550 First Avenue, Room 4-44N      NYU ABU DHABI   Mary Downes, Registrar      NYU SHANGHAI     Duane Voigt, Registrar     Current and former NYU students wishing to review records from schools other than those listed above must complete a record request form in person at the office of the Associate Provost, Mr. Hamberger. The office is located at 194 Mercer Street, Room 403F. The request should specify what records are to be inspected. Upon receipt of a request, the record review officer notifies the office(s) maintaining the requested record(s), arranges for the transmittal of the record(s), sets up an appointment for the student's review of such records, and supervises the review. Students are provided with this review opportunity within a reasonable time, not to exceed 45 days from the date of receipt of the request by the appropriate record review officer. If any material or document in the education record(s) of a student includes information on more than one student, the student may inspect and review or be informed of only that part of the material or document relating to herself or himself. Students may duplicate materials other than NYU transcripts at a cost of 10 cents per page. Students will not be permitted to remove the original record(s) from the record review office. At the conclusion of the review the record(s) is returned to the originating office(s).   If a student is physically unable to come to the appropriate record review office, and if this inability would effectively deny the student access to her or his records, the student may obtain a record request form by calling or writing to the appropriate record review officer. The student should then return the completed request form by mail to the record review officer. The officer will make special arrangements for the review.   V. Waivers   A student may waive his or her right to access to confidential recommendations for any of the following: admission to an educational institution; employment; receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. Waiver forms are available from each Dean's Office and in Departmental Offices. The waiver must be in writing and must be signed by the student. If a student waives her or his right to access, the recommendations must be used solely for the purposes for which they were intended, and, if the student so requests, the University will give her or him the names of the individuals who made the recommendations. Recommendations mailed to third parties should include a copy of the signed waiver, so that the third party is aware that the student has waived access to the recommendation, and, hence, cannot obtain access to it from the third party's records in the future. The University does not have the right to make the student's waiver a condition to the student's receipt of any service or benefit from the University. Waivers may be revoked by the student, but the revocation will not enable the student to gain access to confidential recommendations made while the waiver was in effect.   VI. Amendment of Records   If a student believes that any of the education records relating to her or him contain information that is inaccurate, misleading, or in violation of her or his rights of privacy, she or he may ask the University to correct or delete such information. The student may also ask that additional explanatory material be inserted in the record. Requests for amendment of a record or the addition of explanatory material should be submitted at the conclusion of the record review on form PL 93-3803, available from the appropriate record review officer. The reasons for the request should be set forth on the form and should clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. There is no obligation on the part of the University to grant such a request. If the University declines to amend the records as requested by the student, it will so inform the student, and the student may request that explanitory material be inserted into the record or may request a hearing (see Section VII). The right to challenge the contents of an educational record may not be used to question substantive educational judgments that have been correctly recorded or to contest the assignment of a grade. Grades given in the course of study include written evaluations that reflect institutional judgment of the quality of a student's academic performance.   VII. Hearings   If the University declines to amend a student's record as he or she requests, the student has the right to a hearing. The hearing will be held within a reasonable time after the University receives the student's request for it. The hearing may be conducted by any person, including an official of the University, who does not have a direct interest in its outcome. At the hearing, the student may be assisted or represented by one or more individuals, including legal counsel, of the student's choice at the student's expense. Within a reasonable time following the hearing, the hearing officer will make her or his recommendation(s) in writing to the President (or his designee). This recommendation, and the written decision of the President or his designee on behalf of the University, will be based solely on the evidence presented at the hearing and will include a summary of that evidence and the reasons for the conclusions reached. If the decision of the President or his designee is to amend the record, the record will be amended and the student will be given written notice of the amendment. If the decision of the President or his designee is not to amend the record, the student will be informed that he or she has the right to place a written statement in his or her record, which will be kept in the file as long as the file itself is kept. The statement may comment on the contested portion of the file or say why the student disagrees with the decision of the President or his designee, or do both. If the contested portion of the file is disclosed to anybody, the student's statement will also be disclosed.   VIII. Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information   Prior to disclosing personally identifiable information from a student's education records, the University will obtain the student's signed and dated written consent to such disclosure, unless consent is not required by law. The student's written consent must &quot;specify the records that may be disclosed; state the purpose of the disclosure; and identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made.&quot; In the case of certain offices, such as the career services or preprofessional committees, students can sign a blanket consent for disclosure of specified records to &quot;appropriate third parties.&quot; Signed and dated written consent &quot;may include a record and signature in electronic form that identifies and authenticates&quot; the student as the source of the consent and indicates the student\u2019s \u201capproval of the information contained in the electronic consent.&quot; Such consent is not needed for disclosure of directory information (see Section IX below) or for disclosure:     to the student;   to school officials with legitimate educational interests; school officials having a legitimate educational interest include any University employee acting within the scope of her or his University employment, and any duly appointed agent or representative of the University acting within the scope of his or her appointment.   to accrediting, testing, and similar organizations;   to parents of dependent students (see Section XI below);   to certain federal, state, and local officials and authorities, in each case as specified in Subpart D of the FERPA Regulations, 34 C.F.R. Part 99;   in connection with financial aid for which the student has applied or received, under the conditions set forth in the FERPA Regulations.   to comply with a subpoena or judicial order, provided that the University attempts to notify the student of the order or subpoena before complying with it (unless, in the case of a Federal grand jury subpoena or other subpoena issued for a law enforcement purpose, the subpoena orders that such notification not be made), or to provide information to the Attorney General of the United States or to his designee, without notification to the student, in response to a court order issued in connection with the investigation or prosecution of terrorism crimes as specified in Title 18, U.S. Code, sections 2331 and 2332 (g) (5) (B). Permission is not needed for disclosure to a court when the University has initiated legal action against a parent or student or when necessary for the University to defend itself when a parent or student has initiated action against it.   in an emergency where there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individual, to appropriate parties whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. In such cases, the University will maintain a record of the articulable and significant threat which formed the basis for disclosure and the parties to whom the information was disclosed.   when forwarding education records to the officials of another institution (a) in which a student seeks or intends to enroll if that institution requests such records, or (b) if the student is enrolled in, or receiving services from, that institution while she or he is attending NYU, provided that the disclosure is for purposes related to the student\u2019s enrollment or transfer. The student's consent is not required for such disclosure, nor is any other notice of the transfer required, although a copy of each record so disclosed will be provided to the student if the student asks for it.   of the final results of any University disciplinary proceeding relating to a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense allegedly perpetrated by a University student to an alleged victim of that crime or offense, regardless of whether or not it is concluded that a violation was committed. The consent of the alleged student perpetrator is not a condition to this disclosure.   of the final results of any University disciplinary proceeding reached on or after October 7, 1998 if it is determined that a student is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or non-forcible sex offense and the student has committed a violation of the University\u2019s rules or policies with respect to the allegation. The names of other students, including the victim or witnesses, may not be disclosed without their prior written consent.   to the parent of a student regarding the student\u2019s violation of any Federal, State, or local law, or any rule or policy of the University, regarding the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance, provided that the University has determined that the student has committed a disciplinary violation with respect to that use or possession and the student is under the age of 21 at the time of the disclosure.   State sex offender registration and community notification programs     In the case of certain offices, such as the career services or preprofessional committees, students can sign a blanket consent for disclosure of records to &quot;appropriate third parties.&quot;   The University will maintain a record of each request for and disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education records of a student to persons outside the University for as long as such records are maintained. The record will indicate the parties who have requested or obtained the personally identifiable information and the legitimate interest these parties had in requesting or obtaining the information. The student has the right to inspect and review this record of requests. The requirement to keep records of requests does not apply to: disclosures to the student; disclosures made pursuant to the written consent of the student; disclosures to University employees determined by the University to have legitimate educational interests; disclosures of directory information; or disclosures made in compliance with a Federal grand jury or other law enforcement subpoena which orders that the existence or the contents of the subpoena or the information furnished not be disclosed to the student.   In instances where disclosure of personally identifiable information from an education record to a third party is permitted (see above), the third party is subject to the requirements of the FERPA Regulations with respect to possible redisclosure of that information and the University must so inform the third party.   When a student gives his or her written consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from his or her records to persons outside the University, the student may request that the University provide him or her with a copy of any records thus disclosed, and the University will do so.   The purpose of the consent form is to permit the student to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information in her or his education records. The fact that a student signs a consent form, whether specific or &quot;blanket,&quot; does not, however, bind the University to make the student's records available to the third party or parties who have obtained the student's consent to their review of his or her files. The student's records are still the property of the University and, even if a consent has been signed, the University will exercise its discretion in each case by disclosing to the third party only such information, records, and files, if any, as the University deems appropriate in light of the reason that the third party is seeking access to the student's records. Because of this, all consents obtained directly from students by third parties must include a specification of the records to be disclosed, the purposes of the disclosure, and the person or groups of persons to whom disclosure may be made. The original signed consent must be provided to the University by the third party at the time the request for access is made. The University will retain the original consent. Records to which students are denied access because they are not &quot;education records&quot; usually will not be made available to an outside party. In addition, the third party generally will not be permitted to make copies of records to which he or she is granted access, even if the consent signed by the student explicitly gives permission for such copies to be made. If the student wishes the third party to have copies of documents in her or his file, or if there are other documents to which the third party has not been granted access by the University but which the student wishes the third party to have, the student may copy those records (see Section IV above) and provide such copies to the third party directly.   IX. Directory Information   The University has designated the following student information as &quot;directory information.&quot; Directory information may be disclosed for any purpose, at the discretion of the University, except as provided below.   Name, dates of attendance, NYU school or college, class, previous institution(s) attended, major field of study, full or part-time status, degree(s) conferred (including dates), honors and awards (including dean's list), past and present participation in officially recognized activities (including positions held and official statistics related to such participation and performance), e-mail address and NetID. [Important. See notes (1) and (2) below.]   (1) E-mail address and NetID are directory information for internal purposes only and will not be made available to the general public except in specified directories from which students may opt out.   (2) Under federal law, address information, telephone listings, and age are also considered directory information for military recruitment purposes. Address refers to &quot;physical mailing address&quot; but not e-mail address.   Currently enrolled students may refuse to permit disclosure of this information. To do so, a student enrolled in any school other than the College of Dentistry, School of Medicine, School of Law, or Stern School of Business - Graduate Division should complete a form requesting nondisclosure at the Office of the University Registrar, 25 West 4th Street, and submit it to that office. A hold will be placed on the release of directory information filed with the University Registrar, which will remain in effect until the student files a written request to remove it. Students in the College of Dentistry, School of Law, School of Medicine, or Stern School of Business - Graduate Division should complete the nondisclosure form available in the Recording Office of the school in which he or she is enrolled. Students in these schools will be informed if they must file a new nondisclosure form each academic year. A request not to disclose directory information applies to the entire category of such information and cannot be selective with regard to specific items defined as directory information. Similarly, a request not to disclose directory information applies to all individuals and organizations, subject to the exceptions stated in Section VIII above, and cannot be selective with regard to specific individuals or organizations.   A student may not use the withholding of directory information to prevent the University from disclosing or requiring the student to disclose his or her name, identifier, or institutional e-mail address in a class in which the student is enrolled.   Students should consider very carefully the effect of a decision to withhold directory information. If that decision is made, any requests during that academic year for such information from non-University persons or organizations will be refused (subject to the exceptions stated in Section VIII above or unless the student has subsequently removed the hold by notifying the Registrar or appropriate Recording Office in writing). If a student does not specifically request the withholding of directory information by filing the appropriate University form, as indicated above, the University assumes that he or she approves of the disclosure of such information. The University disclaims any and all liability for inadvertent disclosure of directory information designated to be withheld.   X. Review by Government Agencies   Authorized representatives of government agencies may occasionally ask to see a student's education records. Such requests are usually made when a student or former student has applied for a government job. The government agent should be referred to the appropriate record review officer, as indicated in Section IV above. Generally, the University will handle such requests in the same manner as other requests for access to student records by third parties (see Section VIII), provided that the government agent shows official identification and provides a signed release from the student, a copy of which will be retained by the University.   If a government agent has a subpoena, she or he should be referred to the Office of Legal Counsel. Under the FERPA regulations, the University is required to make a reasonable attempt to notify the student prior to complying with the subpoena unless, in the case of a subpoena issued for law enforcement purposes, the subpoena orders that such notification not be made. (See Section VIII above.)   XI. Requests from Parents   Occasionally, a parent will request information from a student's education records or a copy of the student's transcript. Under FERPA, institutions are not required to disclose such information to the student's parent, but may do so if: (a) there is written consent to the disclosure from the student, or (b) the parent requests the information in writing and provides evidence that the student is his or her dependent under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (See Section VIII above.), or (c) the student has violated a Federal, State, or local law or any rule or policy of the University regarding the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance, provided that the University has determined that the student has committed a disciplinary violation with respect to that use or possession and the student is under the age of 21 at the time of the disclosure.   If the procedure indicated under (b) is followed, the University's practice is to ask the parent to establish dependency by providing a copy of her or his latest federal income tax return. Confidential information on the return may be expunged, provided that the information that remains is sufficient for the University to ascertain that the parent has claimed the student as a dependent. Further, it is also the practice of the University (except in a health or safety emergency) to inform the student of such a request and of the information requested before deciding whether to provide the requested information to the parent. &quot;Parent&quot; is defined by FERPA as &quot;a natural parent, a guardian, or an individual acting as a parent in the absence of a parent or guardian.&quot;   XII. Annual Notice   The University will inform students of these Guidelines and of their rights under FERPA and the Department of Education's FERPA regulations by placing a notice about them on the website of the Registrar. For Annual Notice, go to http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/university-policies/ferpa.html .     For additional information or a copy of the statute, the FERPA regulations, or these Guidelines, please contact Barnett W. Hamberger, Associate Provost, 212.998.2310, 194 Mercer Street, Room 403F.   September 2013                            About This Policy                                         Effective Date:        January 01, 2009                    Issuing Authority:        Office of the Provost                        Responsible Officer:        Barnett W. Hamberger, Associate Provost                      Office Name:        Office of the Provost                                                          Purpose of the Policy                                        The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) was enacted to protect the privacy of students' education records, to establish the rights of students to inspect and review their education records, and to provide students with an opportunity to have inaccurate or misleading information in their education records corrected.                                            Who needs to know this policy                                        All NYU employees who need or have access to student records, primarily in but not limited to, Albert or SIS.                                            Policy Definitions                                        Student: includes any person with respect to whom the University maintains an education record, whether or not that person is currently in attendance. Persons who have not been in attendance are not \"students\" entitled to review their records. Thus, persons who have applied to and been admitted by the University, but who have not yet begun to attend classes, are not eligible to review their records. Also, students who, while attending one school or college of NYU, have applied to another NYU school or college, are not entitled to review records of the school or college to which they are applying until they have been accepted and are in attendance at that school or college.   Education Records: those records, files, documents, and other materials that contain information directly related to a student and that are maintained by the University.   Appropriate Third Parties: those to which students can sign a blanket consent for disclosure of records.   Directory Information: such information as may be disclosed for any purpose, at the discretion of the University, except as provided in \"Part IX\" at left. These include name, dates of attendance, NYU school or college, class, previous institution(s) attended, major field of study, full- or part-time status, degree(s) conferred (including dates), honors and awards (including dean\u2019s list), and past and present participation in officially recognized activities (including positions held and official statistics related to such participation and performance).   Parent: is defined by FERPA as \"a natural parent, a guardian, or an individual acting as a parent in the absence of a parent or guardian.\"                                           The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Video                        This content requires the Macromedia Flash Player. Get Flash Player                                      In this short video, introduced by President John Sexton, you will learn about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and how it relates to the University community.   NOTE: Since the video was produced, the University has updated its student information system. Please read the following for an important clarification.   The FERPA video addresses the topic of the release of directory information. The video refers to a typed notation in the old student information system that said &quot;PRIVATE&quot; to indicate that a student had requested that directory information not be released. Please do not look for this notation in the current system. Instead, if a student requested that directory information not be released, there will be a &quot;privacy shade&quot; icon in the upper right hand corner of the Student Center page.              Tutorial   The FERPA tutorial is designed to give you a base level of knowledge of the rules governing release of student information and to ensure that you understand your obligation for proper use and protection of student records, whether available through Albert, SIS, or any other form.   The tutorial will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.                                                  Clarification for Faculty                               About the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)   A Clarification for Instructors   As a faculty member at New York University, you may have access to certain student information which is protected by the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) , as well as by the University\u2019s Policy on Personal Identification Numbers. Below is some key information you should know about these University policies:   1)  A student\u2019s personally identifiable information is not to be disclosed or displayed publicly , nor to be posted on University electronic information or data systems.   2)  Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to:   University identification (UID) numbers   Email addresses   Contact information (telephone and address)   3)  The following documents which you might acquire contain personally identifiable information:   Class lists   University/School forms   Other University documents   In more specific terms, these policies mean:   1)  As a course instructor, you are not entitled to access your student's academic records (transcript, degree progress, etc.). This information may be accessed by the student's adviser, but not by instructors;   2)  You should not pass around a single sheet of paper in class where all the students have written their contact information (phone, email address, etc.); collect the contact information on individual sheets or cards; students should share their personal information with each other only voluntarily and on their own;   3)  You may discuss a student\u2019s personal information only with (a) the student, or (b) University officials who have a legitimate educational interest in having that information; do not discuss the student\u2019s performance or other information with parents or other outsiders, unless the student has given you express permission;   4)  Don't leave papers, tests, or other assignments in a pile to be picked up. Instead, they must be put in individual envelopes or in a secure place where the secretary has to retrieve the specific paper for a student (who, if not known, should show an ID);   5)  When sending a mass email to all students in your class, use the blind copy (bcc) function rather than the carbon copy (cc) function, since student emails are directory information for limited purposes only;     6)  If using an anti-plagiarism service, you must remove the student's name, ID number, or any other personally identifiable information before submitting the paper;   For further guidance on creating student-submitted TurnItIn assignments, click here .   7)  Don't post grades by name, social security number, or University ID number;   8) When you are no longer a student\u2019s instructor, you should destroy the personal information you have about him or her.

Clarification for Parents                                 About the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)     A Clarification for Parents   As a parent, you are understandably concerned about your college student's success, and may have questions about obtaining access to information pertaining to their records. Access to student records is governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA).   Among its several purposes, FERPA was enacted to:     Protect the privacy of students' educational records;   Establish the rights of students to inspect and review their educational records; and,   Provide students with an opportunity to allow inaccurate or misleading information in their educational records to be corrected.     According to FERPA, these rights, which may be exercised by the parents of elementary or secondary school students, belong to the student once he/she is in attendance at an institution of postsecondary education, regardless of the student's age or who is paying their tuition bills.     To Obtain Access to Your Son/Daughter's Educational Records in Compliance with FERPA:   1. Ask him/her to provide written consent to the office or person from which you wish to obtain information. This permission should be specific as to whom permission is being given, what information may be shared, and with whom (by name) it may be shared. The student will need to show his/her photo ID when submitting written permission.   2. Your son/daughter may provide consent to access advisor information, class schedule, financial aid, grades, and other information through the Albert mobile website , and to tuition and housing bills through eSuite .   3. You, the parent(s), may also make a request in writing, and provide evidence that the student is your dependent under the Internal Revenue Code. You will need to provide a copy of your latest federal income tax return. It is only necessary to send a copy of the information sufficient enough to determine dependency, omitting other confidential information, if you choose.   Before the University decides whether to provide the information, your son/daughter will be informed of your request, which should be sent to:   New York University    Office of the Associate Provost    194 Mercer Street 403F    New York, NY 10012    212-998-2312                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
