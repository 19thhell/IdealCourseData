In that sense, the course is perfect for students interested in becoming better music photographers as well as students interested in first-hand observation of great photography in process. Students will consider the best methods of taking professional photographs with a special focus on how photographs can contribute to the branding and image development of recording artists. During the course, legendary photographer Mick Rock will present three invaluable sessions. In the first Mr. Rock presents a lecture about his work and career to students, discussing his role in creating the iconic images for artists like David Bowie and Queen. In the second, selected students present their photography to Mick Rock for in-class constructive criticism ad professional guidance. And in the third, students will get the rare opportunity to observe Mick Rock in an actual photo session wrapped up by a follow-up conversation. These three sessions are anchored in the course's significant lecture component in which students simultaneously learn about the history and visual culture of music photography, imaging and fashion. These lectures, run by visual artist and record label creative director Joe Mama-Nitzberg, are designed to help give students and aspiring photographers the necessary context and theoretical tools to work effectively in the music photography arena. Students will also learn about the art and business of creating visual images in recorded music, not limited to creating album covers, publicity photos, promotional videos as well as the overall personal image and \"brand\" of the artist. Tisch Photography Department students are particularly encouraged to enroll.
