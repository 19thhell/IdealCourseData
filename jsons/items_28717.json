ITP and NYU now offer us access to laser cutting, CNC routing, and 3D stereolithography. In this class we will learn how to design for and operate these machines. Emphasis will be put on designing functional parts that can fit into a larger project or support other components as well as being successful on a conceptual and aesthetic level. In this class we will discover methods to design projects on CAD applications for total control of the result, and we will develop algorithmic ways to create designs from software (Processing) to take advantage of the ability to make parts and projects that are unique, customizable, dependent on external data or random. The class will include 3 assignments to create projects using the three machines (laser, router, 3D) and the opportunity to work on a final project. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;     Class No. 1 Jan 26- Introduction   Class introductions.

Even though algorithmic 2D will only be shown in class next week, consider using algorithmic generated geometry.    Class No. 4 Feb 16 - 2D Algorithmic Design   Using Processing to create 2D design - There are a few reasons for us to want to create our geometry in a computational way rather than in the CAD program: User Interaction, External inputs, Computation and generative algorithms, Randomness.  User Interaction:  brightness tracking to DXF   Etch-A-Sketch keyboard drawing to DXF   External Inputs:  Audio sine wave from microphone to DXF , Audio sine wave from microphone to PDF   Audio FFT from sound clip to DXF , Audio FFT from sound clip to PDF   Video Mirror circles to DXF   Contour using OpenCV to DXF , Contour using OpenCV to PDF   Computation and Generative Algorithms:  Generative Pentigree to DXF   Shiffman Tree to DXF   Randomness:  Random shape gradation to PDF    Using PDF and DXF formats to export design from Processing. You can use both DXF and PDF to go to Vectorworks, DXF works better because there is something funky with the ovals in PDF. For Illustrator PDF works great, DXF is supposed to work natively but seems to require a plugin such as EXDXF-Pro   Processing PDF Library   Processing DXF Library   Craig's Tutorial of getting from Processing to laser via PDF    Importing 2D designes into Vectorworks and Adobe Illustrator for further design and prepping for laser:  Scaling your design interactively and numerically.
