Elisabeth King , an associate professor of international education, explores issues related to conflict and peace building in sub-Saharan Africa. \u00a0King\u2019s book, From Classrooms to Conflict in Rwanda (Cambridge University Press, 2014), has been awarded the Outstanding Canadians Leadership Award from the Ontario History and Social Science Teachers Association. She has received grants from the United States Institute for Peace, the United Nations Development Program, the Folke Bernadotte Academy, and Columbia University\u2019s Earth Clinic.   You work on issues related to conflict resolution and peace-building in Sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 What draws you to this part of the world?   I have always had a passion for issues of conflict resolution and peace-building.\u00a0 While violent conflict has been common the world over, and in fact, a number of convincing studies show that conflict as a whole has been declining worldwide,\u00a0 as a continent, Africa has known continuous war for upwards of 50 years.\u00a0 It remains the part of the world with the most state-based conflicts. \u00a0Sub-Saharan Africa also faces the most remaining challenges for sustainable social development.   At the same time, despite the challenges, when I have the privilege to work in places like Rwanda and Liberia, I am always reminded about the strength of human spirit. As clich\u00e9d as it might sound, there is something very special about the places I have the chance to work in Africa that makes me want to go back time and time again.    Elisabeth King   Can you talk a little about your work in Kenya?   I am just back from Nairobi where I wrapped up data collection on a project that I began in the summer of 2013.\u00a0 This project questions widely-held assumptions about highly youthful populations \u2013 in Kenya the median age is 19; it\u2019s 37 in the US; youth\u2019s aspirations for education and life \u2013 delving into issues like hope, expectations, and role models; and youth\u2019s involvement in violence and peace-building.\u00a0 One of the dimensions that is so exciting about this project is that I have gotten to speak with youth themselves, both in school and out-of-school, about what they want and hope for their lives. I have also spoken with non-governmental organizations and government involved in youth programming. The next part is to further explore the consequences \u2013 potentially positive and negative \u2013 of aspirations that are likely to remain unmet.   What is perhaps even more exciting is how this project is rooted in collaboration here at Steinhardt and the learning we can leverage from that collaboration. My terrific colleague,\u00a0 Dana Burde , is exploring these same issues, using the same research design and instruments, in Karachi, Pakistan. We can then come together and examine the similarities and differences in our findings between these two contexts with, on the one hand, hugely youthful populations, similar diversity of violence, much international education and youth programming, ranked side by side on the Human Development Index, and on the other, very different cultures.    Liberia, May 2009.   What can a researcher bring to the table that can help children and youth in developing countries?   I am always interested in research that answers questions that are not only important for scholarship but that have significant and realistic links to policy and practice.\u00a0 The common thread throughout my research agenda is asking if and how theories of peace-building and development really work, or not, for people on the ground.   In this particular project, we have been speaking with NGOs involved in youth programming in Kenya and Pakistan.\u00a0 We plan to work with one such organization to refine its programming, or even develop a new intervention, based on the findings from our qualitative work on youth aspirations. We then plan to rigorously evaluate the program. \u00a0It\u2019s a dream for a researcher in terms of making the most of the opportunity we have to conduct this research, taking what youth themselves have to say, using that to craft a program that will help other youth, then testing it to see if it is indeed having the hoped-for impacts.

NYUCN Global is involved with research capacity-building with University of Ghana faculty, through a Fogarty grant led by colleague Dr. Olugbenga Obedegbe.   Kenya   NYUCN Global partners with the University of Nairobi on a number of research studies in Kenya. Early findings from a NIH study in western Kenya led by Professor Ann Kurth has, shown that among heterosexual couples of childbearing age, one in four households include couples where one or both partners are HIV positive. Dr. Kurth is assessing how factors such as cultural desires for large families affect HIV risk, and how to better integrate HIV and reproductive health services. Also in Kenya, Dr. Kurth is working with colleagues in western Kenya in a health system that cares for more than 120,000 persons living with HIV disease to evaluate the use of computerized counseling as an adjunct to extremely scarce health workers. Dr. Kurth is developing gender-specific combination HIV prevention packages targeted at youth in Western Kenya. This study uses mathematical modeling to evaluate intervention impact. She is also evaluating Kenya\u2019s needle exchange program , the first such program in sub-Saharan Africa, using a stepped wedge trial design.   Tanzania   In Tanzania the College\u2019s GHI Global Health Scholar program is working with leaders in the Ministry of Health and the Tanzanian Nurse and Midwifery Council to improve maternal health services delivered by midwives.   Uganda   In rural Uganda, Dr. Ann Kurth is working to enhance home-based HIV testing and counseling and providing to HIV positive individuals targeted HIV prevention referrals.
