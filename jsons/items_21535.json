It is required for health management students and recommended for health policy and finance students. In order to meet the challenges of the marketplace, organizations will need to improve the quality of the services they provide; streamline their clinical delivery and support systems, and transform their human resources management accordingly. The degree to which organizations manage the people issues will, to a great extent, determine the success of our health care institutions. This course serves as a comprehensive foundation for all aspects of human resources planning, development, and administration and is vital to both the human resources professional and the line manager. Through the text readings, journal articles, case analyses, and student presentations, we will explore key issues and concerns in the human resources field.

It is required for health management students and recommended for health policy and finance students. In order to meet the challenges of the marketplace, organizations will need to improve the quality of the services they provide; streamline their clinical delivery and support systems, and transform their human resources management accordingly. The degree to which organizations manage the people issues will, to a great extent, determine the success of our health care institutions. This course serves as a comprehensive foundation for all aspects of human resources planning, development, and administration and is vital to both the human resources professional and the line manager. Through the text readings, journal articles, case analyses, and student presentations, we will explore key issues and concerns in the human resources field.
