Conversation and Composition is a   reading, writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed   on refining written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the   ability to articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and   argue points of view; developing analytic and interpretive writing   skills; and encouraging flexibility of expression. In addition, a   thorough grammar review will be part of our work. During the course of   the semester we will explore the fascination with ghosts, ghostly   apparitions, scenes of dread, and haunted or scientifically inexplicable   events from the 1800s to today\u2014in particular, with the enduring   association of new technologies and electronic media with paranormal or   spiritual phenomena from a media or science and technologies studies   perspective. GERM-UA132 M, W 12:30 \u2013 1:45 Germany in Contemporary Cinema Alys George This post-intermediate course investigates how contemporary German cinema  has thematized recent German history. How have filmmakers approached topics  such as the resistance movements of World War II, postwar family life, East German  surveillance, the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jewish identity, social inequality  and injustice, the immigrant experience, and European unity? Directors\u2019  approaches to depicting 20th- and 21st-century Germany  history are diverse, surprising, deeply personal, and often humorous. You will  improve your language proficiency in speaking, writing, and listening, while  increasing your knowledge of German film, German history and culture, and film  techniques in general. Films by leading German directors will include Das  Leben der Anderen (2006), Berlin is in Germany (2001), Die  fetten Jahre sind vorbei (2004), Rosenstra\u00dfe (2003), Im  Juli (2000), and Das Wunder von Bern (2003). GERM-UA220 M, W 11:00 \u2013 12:15 Introduction to German Culture &amp; Thought: Luther to Nietzsche Christiane Frey How   is it that Martin Luther, the firebrand initiator of the Protestant   Reformation, could call for a liberation from the dogmatism of the   church and yet maintain that all men should obey secular authority? Why   do we generally hold that the philosopher and scientist G.W. Leibniz   stood at the beginning of modernity (and what, by the way, is   \u201cmodernity\u201d supposed to be?) despite the fact that he wrote a massive   volume on how to defend the existence of God? Is the Enlightenment   tolerant? Did Hegel really believe that the modern state should be   Christian? Could it be true that one can tell lies in an extra-moral   sense, to disfigure a title from Nietzsche? And last but not least: to   what use (or abuse) should one look into (intellectual) history? This   course will address these and other questions by exploring the history   of German thought and culture from the 16th to the 19th century.   Discussion will focus \u2013 at times perhaps in unconventional ways and   through the lens of modern theory \u2013 on some of the most prominent texts   of the canon of philosophy, theology, the sciences, and, of course,   literature. Beyond the authors mentioned, readings will also include   texts by Paracelsus, Johannes Kepler, Kant, Goethe, Kleist, and Rahel   Varnhagen. GERM-UA240 T, R 3:30 \u2013 4:45 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,   three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways   provided radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the   psyche. Writing from the mid-19th century through the 1930s, the three   thinkers placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions   of the state, the subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this   course is to provide a comprehensive engagement with the writings of   Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by bringing them into dialogue with each   other. That is, rather than reading the three authors chronologically,   the course is organized around six topoi \u2013 interpretation, history,   subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a paradigmatic text   from each author is read. The seminar underscores their prevailing   actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern   thinking. GERM-UA349 T, R 11:00 \u2013 12:15 German Romanticism: Speculative Technologies: The Literature of German Romanticism Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to German Romanticism, a movement that   grasped itself as a literary, philosophical and scientific watershed in   human history. Rather than following the traditional division between   early, high, and late Romanticism, we will track three figures in   Romanticism\u2019s multifaceted corpus: reflexivity, depth, and the social.   We will start with the emergence of the movement in Jena and its roots   in biological and philosophical discourses, where reflexivity plays a   crucial role in the fragmentary and novelistic writings of Friedrich and   August Wilhelm Schlegel, as well as Novalis and Ludwig Tieck. The   troubling figure of \u201cdepth\u201d will make up the second unit of inquiry, in   such figures as Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich Creuzer, and   Clemens Brentano. Deploying both of these techniques, Heinrich von   Kleist, E. T. A. Hoffmann and Heinrich Heine bring Romantic techniques   to bear on the changing fabric of the social, revealing Romanticism as a   technically concrete and simultaneously speculative response to the   increasingly complexity of modern life. GERM-UA283 (HBRJD-UA685 ) T, R 3:30-4:45 The Holocaust: The Third Reich and the Jews David Engel This   lecture course is an historical investigation of the evolution of Nazi   policies toward Jews; of Jewish behavior in the face of those policies;   and of the attitudes of other countries, both within and outside the   Nazi orbit, for the situation of Jews under the rule of the Third Reich.   GERM-UA999 T 9:30 - 12:30 Senior Honors Seminar Ara Merjian GERM-UA501 TBD Honors Thesis Alys George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2014  GERM-UA133 -  German  Culture 1890 \u2013 1989: Nationalism,  Industrialization, and War: Germany, 1890-1945  - Chadwick Smith This course examines the interaction between German literature and other  social institutions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will  investigateGerman responses to rapidly changing technological, economic, and  material conditions following the failed revolutions and continuing through  German unification and industrialization, and culminating in the First World  War. We will also consider how literature and theoretical writing provide a  site inwhich to imagine social change, as we examine a variety of conflicts  between traditional social norms and new conceptions of self and society, and  trace the evolution of conceptions of social class, gender and identity and the  anxiety such developments inspired. Readings will include selections from:  Benjamin, Brecht, Fontane, Freud, Musil, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Simmel.  GERM-UA152 -  Intro to German Literature  - Leif Weatherby Required for the German major. Introduces  students to representative authors and works of German literature, with  emphasis on the modern period. Students learn basic conventions of literature  and literary interpretation, as well as strategies for the effective reading of  shorter and longer prose works, drama, and poetry. Guided writing assignments  focus on developing the language skills necessary for effective written  analysis and interpretation of literary texts in German.  GERM-UA244 - German  Intellectual Tradition: The Myth of the Machine. From Divine Automata  to the Internet - Leif Weatherby We live in a world of technological mediation. Devices provide us with the  rules--for geographical orientation, fordating, for knowing the weather. Do we  use our devices, or do they use us? The question is old, and this course looks  at cultures of machines from the Early Modern period to the present. It will  proceed thematically, treating problems in historical technological cultures  like computers (Pascal, Babbage, Kittler), automata (Vaucanson, Hoffmann,  Helmholtz, Merimee, \u010capek), divine machines (Leibniz, Jean Paul, Wiener,  G\u00fcnther), the advent of film (M\u00fcnsterberg, Lang, Benjamin), animals/humans and  \"the tool\" (Geroi-Lourhan, Heidegger, Darwin/Marx, Engels, Kapp,  Samuel Butler) and the so-called \"megamachine\" of modern society  (J\u00fcnger, Mumford). The framework will be the negative anthropology tradition  between Herder and Gehlen and the reversal of the myth from the extension of  human powers to the primacy of the technological. The shared conviction of  nearly all these authors is that culture must reflect on its machines--and on  itself as a machine-like entity--in order to survive .  GERM-UA249 -  Intro to Theory : Critical Theory from Plato to  Adorno and Beyond  - Alan Itkin With Plato\u2019s Republic , critical theory begins with a bang: Plato  bans poets from his ideal republic, telling us that they are nothing but liars  corrupting those who read their works. Poetry, Plato writes, is misleading  because it is nothing but a copy of a copy, an imitation of the mere appearance  of reality. The two questions Plato links together\u2014what is literature, and what  is it good for?\u2014have been at the center of critical theory ever since, and the  answers theorists give to the one are almost always implicitly answers to the  other as well. In this course we will trace these questions from the classical  period to the present with the help of theorists including Plato, Aristotle,  Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Zizek. We will  examine and develop the principles and methods we use to analyze and interpret  literature and the other arts, because there can be no interpretation without  theoretical assumptions. As another critical theorist, Paul de Man, has told  us, the resistance to theory is itself a form of theory.  GERM-UA487 -  Seminar on 19th Century Literature: Staging  Revolt in German Drama  - Chadwick Smith This course examines German drama from the late 18th and early 19th centuries,  when discourses of rights and the equal application of law supplant other  ethical and political discourses, a shift that requires a revised relationship  between the individual human subject and the state. Giving a political role to  aesthetics, the stage becomes the public venue in which these reconfigurations  are played out. The focus is on the partisans\u2014on G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, Karl  Moor, Hermann, and Danton. An analysis of these figures allows for a  delineation of the borders of state violence. These works raise questions the  contours of sovereignty. What rights do citizens have over and above those  granted by the State? What right to revolt? What power do those outside of the  political order wield? How do states attempt to contain dissent or brand it  terror? These questions will structure the course and identify parallels to the  contemporary world.  FALL 2013 GERM-UA153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation.      Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will  be distributed by the instructor. Materials may include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate one or more longer prose texts (TBD) from German to English as a  class. This work will accompany our course throughout the semester. GERM-UA111 - Conversation/Composition: Taking Sides in  Berlin - A Century of Debates in and about a Divided City -  Chadwick Smith  The course follows Berlin\u2019s course through the  tumultuous 20th century, in which Berlin can rightfully be said to have played  the central, starring role. By attending to a series of representative and  debates and divisions that came to define the century, we will tour a city  riven by the forces of industrialization and rapid growth, torn asunder by war,  physically divided in two during the cold war, and finally reunified to emerge  as a multicultural world capital. When possible, we will trace the historical public and private divisions  forward to the forms they take in contemporary Berlin, a magnet for an  international creative class and setting for very contemporary debates over  memorialization, race and ethnicity, and art. Toward this goal, we will engage  with and comment upon them through the lens of news and entertainment media.  We will work with a variety of written (short  stories, poetry, newspaper articles, feuilleton , and a novel) and visual  sources including film, visual art, and architecture and design. At the same  time, we will learn to write in various genres such as the news report,  commentary or feuilleton , and film or book review. Toward these goals, we will also  address the development of the various media\u2019s role in society, and the way in  which changing media technologies affect interaction with culture and language.   Conversation and Composition is designed for  students with a solid grasp on German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of German language, history, politics, and culture, through  reading, discussion, and writing. All readings, discussion, and written work  for the course will be in German. We will work on refining written and spoken  expression with particular focus on the ability to articulate opinions,  exchange substantive information, and argue points of view; developing analytic  and interpretive writing skills; and expanding students\u2019 linguistic toolkit. A  thorough grammar review will thus necessarily be part of our work.  GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition:  Literature, the Sciences &amp; Philosophy: Kepler to Kleist - Christiane  Frey  How did the  sciences, philosophy, and literature interact and influence one another on the  way to becoming the discrete pursuits they are today? This course will approach  this question by tracing a series of entanglements that challenge our sense of  what knowledge is. We will explore, for example, why Kepler wrote a dream  narrative to promote his scientific discoveries; how Leibniz\u2019s philosophy was  shaped by the microscope and romances; how the modern novel aligns with  statistics. We will retrace the birth of a new science called \u201caesthetics,\u201d  investigate how Goethe\u2019s affinity to chemistry changed his way of writing, and  discuss how the romantic concept of science might question our idea of the  humanities and the sciences as \u201ctwo cultures.\u201d Finally, we will ask how all  these \u201ccases\u201d are connected and what they tell us about the distinctions we  rely on to produce knowledge.   GERM-UA366 -  20th Century Prose: Women\u2019s Voices from Germany and Austria - Alys George  This course introduces you to prose works by a selection  of the most influential 20th-century women writers from Germany and Austria  (among them Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9, Anna Seghers, Ingeborg Bachmann, Christa Wolf,  and the Nobel Prize-winners Elfriede Jelinek and Herta M\u00fcller). We consider  what constitutes Frauenliteratur, \u201cwomen\u2019s writing,\u201d but also think through  major historical topics of the past century as represented in literary texts by  female authors. These include: the role of women at the fin de si\u00e8cle; the New  Woman in the Weimar Republic; life under National Socialism; women\u2019s roles in  post-WWII reconstruction; gender roles in the Communist bloc; the women\u2019s  liberation movement; immigrant and minority discourses; and the status of  gender and sexuality as reflected by contemporary media. Genres covered will  include autobiography, short story, novella, and novel.   GERM-UA283 - Topics: The Portrait -  Christopher Wood A portrait is a depiction or description of a real individual. Portraiture  faces a series of conceptual challenges: how much information is necessary to  secure reference to the portrayed person? how is the effect of likeness  achieved? what is, in the end, \u201cindividual\u201d about a human being? All cultures  in all times have produced portraits. Portraiture reveals how a culture thinks  about persons, selves, and souls. Some portraits are also works of art; how  does this change the game? The seminar will approach a wide range of examples,  pictorial and textual, from a variety of perspectives. Topics will include:  portraits of holy men and women (icons); tomb portraits; portrait photography;  portraits and the state (royal effigies, defamatory portraits, ID cards);  verbal portraits; the portrait as a theme in fiction; biography and  autobiography; portraits and the performance of self; studio models.   GERM-UA999 \u2013  Senior Honors Seminar - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby   GERM-UA501 \u2013  Honors Thesis - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2013  GERM-UA152 - Introduction to Literature - Arne Hoecker   This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to  a selection of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written  in German language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close  and critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. All  readings in German.  GERM-UA185 - Introduction to German Poetry: Das Ich und  das Ding - Leif Weatherby  This course introduces the long tradition of German lyric  poetry. Lyric is usually associated with the sentimental and experiential  subject, longing for the completeness of nature or the embrace of a lover. The  lyric subject, however, is constantly confronted by a world of things, and  these things are inflected by the gender of the poet. From the thing-like  nature of the beloved in niedere (but also ebene ) Minne in  the medieval tradition to the \u201cthing-poems\u201d of Rainer Maria Rilke to the  eviscerated and partial objects of Paul Celan, lyric reveals itself as the  genre of the (gendered) subject in a world of objects. We will read poems from  one female and one male poet in five periods: Medieval (Hildegard von Bingen,  Walter von der Vogelweide); Early Modern (Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg,  Andreas Gryphius); Romanticism (Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin); Modernism (Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Rainer Maria Rilke); and post-WWII  (Ingeborg Bachmann; Paul Celan). Throughout the German lyric corpus, we will  ask ourselves, what is an \u201cI\u201d? To whom and to what gender does this \u201cI\u201d belong?  And how is it mediated by the thing-world? All readings in German. GERM-UA240 -  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Arne Hoecker This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically  new understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin  of much modern thinking.  GERM-UA347 -  German Enlightenment: Vernunft und Schrecken - Leif Weatherby The German \u201cEnlightenment\u201d was and is a controversial hybrid.  The growth of communications technologies across Europe put the fragmented  German-speaking lands into self-perceived cultural, scientific, and  philosophical competition and dialogue with other European nations. In  literature, poets from Albrecht von Haller to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing to  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe struggled to establish a \u201cGerman\u201d paradigm to match  the philosophical and poetic cultures in France, England, and Scotland. From  the start, they maintained the combination of literature, philosophy, and  science, often mixing these apparently distinct spheres for the purposes of  fostering a unified \u201cnation.\u201d This course looks at Enlightenment as a  cross-disciplinary attempt to fashion a culture of \u201creason,\u201d and asks a  question: how does reason deal with its weightiest uncanny counterpart, terror?  Starting with Newton and Leibniz, we will read the philosophical-aesthetic  debates of the 1740s (Bodmer, Gottsched, von Haller), the attempt at  Germanification of tragedy as a philosophical form of literature in the 1750s  (Lessing, Mendelssohn, Nicolai), and the late but leading Enlightener Immanuel  Kant and his natural-scientific counterpart, Johann Blumenbach. We will also  discuss such reactions to \u201cEnlightenment\u201d as Wieland\u2019s \u201csensibility\u201d ( Empfindsamkeit )  movement, the Storm and Stress ( Sturm und Drang) , Lavater\u2019s Physiognomie ,  and Winckelmann's as well as Goethe's and Schiller\u2019s classicism. Throughout, we  will see how the emergent hybrid \u201creason\u201d confronts political and aesthetic  (and even natural-scientific) terrors, and how it\u2014perhaps\u2014produces some of its  own. All readings in German .  GERM-UA283 (This course originates in History-  cross-listed as HIST-UA 283 ) - The Origin of Humanity: History of a  Modern Obsession - Stefanos Geroulanos In its attempt to reexamine and reinterpret the sources and  consequences of human knowledge, the Enlightenment irrevocably displaced the  widely accepted biblical explanation of the origin of man, his creation in the  image and resemblance of God. With this displacement was born, or reborn, a largely  new set of questions: Where does man come from? What was early humanity like?  How has mankind changed or progressed since those early times? How long ago  were those early times? Did culture proper emerge in Greece? In India? At a  historical fount of races and nations? In \u201cprimitive\u201d culture? Which origin  should be taken most seriously\u2014that of the human species, or that of modern  culture? Were the \u201cearly times\u201d a kind of utopia that needs to be recaptured?  And given change and progress, where is mankind today, and where is it going?  What would be the effect of seeking to reconstitute, to bring about, a society  based on this origin? These questions, and the history of the answers offered to  them, will be at the heart of our course. At its most general level, the course  is an introduction and overview of major themes in modern European intellectual  history, focusing on the modern obsession with re-divining and often re-living the  origins of man. We will be concerned with both philosophical texts and  scientific efforts to identify and clarify this origin, with the political  implications of such origins, and not least with efforts to identify who (which  discipline? which political party?) should have authority for determining and  using \u201cthe origin.\u201d We will read some of the crucial texts in the period from  the 1750s to the 1960s, tracing the answers offered by philosophers,  anthropologists, biologists, linguists, and poets. FALL 2012 GERM-UA455 - Goethe - Arne H\u00f6cker This course offers insight into one of the big shots of  German literature: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) is the icon of the  bourgeois artist and universal genius, an Enlightenment philosopher, a  researcher of nature, a poet, and a minister in the state of Weimar. This  course will examine Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. We will  read and discuss Goethe\u2019s prose, poetry, and dramatic work from the late  Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond. In addition,  we will acquaint ourselves with Goethe\u2019s autobiographic and scientific  writings. GERM-UA145 - Viennese Modernism: Love, Madness, Death   - Alys George This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the  culture of turn-of-the-century Vienna, one of the birthplaces of  twentieth-century modernism. The works of Austrian writers, artists,  architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the  political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from  a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama),  film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of  this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by  and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include  Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold  Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl.  This course is a 100-level, post-intermediate course in German, which will also  focus on language acquisition at the advanced level. A portion of the course  will involve visits to museums in New York. GERM-UA111 - Conversation and Composition: Von Geistern,  Gespenstern und anderen merkw\u00fcrdigen Gestalten/Of ghosts and other curious  creatures (taught in German) - Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with  a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their  knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as  a thorough review of grammar. This course explores the fascination with ghosts, ghostly  apparitions, and haunted scenes in the arts from the 1800s to today in a  variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, maybe opera,  paintings/photos, music, popular culture, etc. Authors will include Johann  Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, Johann Peter Hebel, E.T.A. Hoffmann,  Theodor Storm, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Thomas Mann, Marie-Luise  Kaschnitz, Yoko Tawada, Inka Parei, among others. The question why we are fascinated  by the scientifically inexplicable and how it was treated in the arts to this  day will accompany us throughout the semester. Please don\u2019t be scared. GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition: Do the  Revolution: German Culture and Revolutionary Violence - Leif Weatherby Germany has never had a successful revolution. Its culture,  however, has been obsessed with violence and systemic political change from  Luther to the violent leftist groups of the Federal Republic. The external and  passive revolutions that dissolved the feudal system in Germany led the poet  H\u00f6lderlin to call the Germans \u201cthought-rich and deed-poor.\u201d This course will  make a positive of what Marx called the \u201cGerman Ideology,\u201d focusing on the  productive anxieties of a figure of fascination: revolutionary violence.  Starting with Luther\u2019s rejection of the Peasants\u2019 War, we will consider the  French Revolution among the Romantics, the revolutions of 1848 among the Young  Hegelians and Marx, the Russian revolutions among the Expressionists, violence  and art in and around National Socialism, and the anti-capitalist violence of  the RAF and the Baader-Meinhof Group, among others. We will finish the course  with theoretical considerations of the meaning of revolution in contemporary  geopolitics. Authors include: Luther, Hegel, Kleist, Marx, Luxemburg, Toller,  J\u00fcnger, Fassbinder, and Zizek.  SPRING  2012   GERM-UA.133  - German Culture 1890 - 1989: German/Jewish: Negotiating Identity in Post-1945  Literature &amp; Culture -   Alys George This course explores how authors of Jewish heritage in Germany and  Austria have probed the boundaries of identity after 1945. By introducing  students to a range of critical questions and forms of cultural production, the  course aims is to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of  German-Jewish and Austrian-Jewish experience and their contemporary  representations. Central questions will include: can \u201cJewishness,\u201d \u201cGermanness,\u201d or  \u201cAustrianness\u201d be defined? What constitutes \u201cJewish writing\u201d? How are Jewish  identity, experience, and culture \u201ctranslated\u201d into literature and film? How do  Jewish authors perceive their role in contemporary German and Austrian society  and public discourse? What role do the remembrance of the past (in particular,  of the Shoah), the politics of the present, and day-to-day minority experiences  play in public/political discourse and cultural production?  This  questioning is set against the background of the exclusions and atrocities that  shaped German and Austrian society and their relation to those deemed \u2018other\u2019  in the twentieth century. The course will cover topics such as autobiography and exile, language and  gender, memory and \u201cpostmemory\u201d in the cultural production of writers of Jewish  heritage in the German language. Written and visual texts by first-generation  survivors such as Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs, Ilse Aichinger, Edgar Hilsenrath,  and Ruth Kl\u00fcger, as well as by second-generation writers like Barbara  Honigmann, Doron Rabinovici, Maxim Biller, and Esther Dischereit form the core  of the course. These texts will be discussed in connection with theoretical  approaches. Genres will include poetry, drama, autobiography and memoir, short  stories, non-fiction, the novel, and film.  GERM-UA.152  \u2013 Introduction to German Literature   -Arne Hoecker This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection  of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  GERM-UA244  \u2013 German Intellectual Tradition: The Failure of Human Dignity - Chadwick Smith During the long 19th century, literature and philosophy informed the  Enlightenment project of human freedom and emancipation while simultaneously  staging its failure. Starting with Hannah Arendt\u2019s The Origins of  Totalitarianism (1951) and taking the notion of the \u201cperplexities\u201d of modern  human rights as a guiding framework, we will read canonical 19th-century German  literary texts from Goethe to Kafka and place them into dialog with theoretical  and philosophical reflections from the 19th and 20th centuries (Hegel, Marx,  Ranciere, Agamben) in order to explore the problems inherent both within human  rights and in defining the category of the human itself.  GERM-UA.397  \u2013 Topics in 19th Century Literature: Literature and Criminality - Arne Hoecker This course will focus on 19th century German literature by examining the  various intersections between cultural, social and scientific discourse. We  will study literary representations of crime from Romanticism to Realism and  Naturalism, looking at questions of form, genre, and narrativity. In addition,  we will confront these literary representations with judicial and psychological  definitions of criminality, and study their interrelation at the level of  narrative strategies invoked in the portrayal of the criminal.  FALL  2011       GERM-UA.0111  - Conversation and Composition \u2013 Berlin: Metropolis &amp; Metamorphosis - Alys George  Conversation and Composition is designed for post-intermediate students  of German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to  expand on their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through  reading, discussion, and writing. Conversation and Composition is a reading,  writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining  written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the ability to  articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and argue points of  view; developing analytic and interpretive writing skills; and encouraging  flexibility of expression. In addition, a thorough grammar review will be part  of our work. If  Walter Benjamin called Paris the capital of the nineteenth century, Berlin was  in many ways the capital of the twentieth century. The city became a stage for  remarkable shifts and ruptures that occurred between 1900 and 2000, and this  course explores a century of radical cultural, historical, and political  change. Berlin was, by turns, imperial capital; hothouse for the Weimar  Republic\u2019s avant-garde impulses; National Socialism\u2019s imagined \u201cGermania\u201d;  post-World War II divided city; Cold War capital of the GDR; and, today,  capital of a reunified Germany.  We  will take a cultural studies approach to twentieth-century Berlin and learn how  to effectively \u201cread\u201d and interpret textual and visual materials. This course  is designed to be interdisciplinary, so we will work with a variety of written  genres (poetry, short stories, novel, journalistic non-fiction), visual art,  architecture, and film. Authors will include Walter Benjamin, Alfred D\u00f6blin,  Inge Deutschkron, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf, Peter Schneider, Katja  Lange-M\u00fcller, Durs Gr\u00fcnbein, Monika Maron, Zafer Senocak, and Wladimir Kaminer.  Film materials will include Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Gro\u00dfstadt [1927], Berlin  Alexanderplatz , Die M\u00f6rder sind unter uns , Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin ,   Sonnenallee , Berlin: Sinfonie einer Gro\u00dfstadt [2002], and Das  Leben der Anderen .  GERM-UA.0153  - Techniques of Translation   - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students  will encounter diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic  problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The  course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic  structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as well as written  expression. A background reader in English will familiarize students with  historical and theoretical implications of translation. Photocopies  of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be distributed  by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine articles; recipes;  TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical articles; pop  material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts: prose,  theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate a longer prose text (TBD) from German to English as a class. This  work will accompany our course throughout the semester.  GERM-UA.0244  - The Age of angst : German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1939 - Alys George  This course explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and  anxiety that pervaded German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and  early twentieth centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of  war, rapid industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the  political and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the  very bedrock upon which society had been built. The intellectual and aesthetic  responses to this pervasive sense of angst and upheaval, as well as the  challenges and changes themselves, form the focus of this course. We will  reflect in depth on how the intellectual impulses informed aesthetic innovation  as we explore the meaning and nature of modernity and crisis in early  twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will include Nietzsche, Freud,  Loos, Simmel, Weber, Benjamin, Heidegger, and Kracauer.  GERM-UA.0366  - 20th Century Prose: Miniatures of Modernity from Nietzsche to Benjamin - Arne H\u00f6cker German and Austrian writers from the turn of the century to the Weimar  Republic experimented with genres of short prose as a privileged literary form  to express philosophical thought and cultural criticism. Through close readings  of German short prose pieces from Nietzsche\u2019s aphorisms to Kafka\u2019s parables,  and Benjamin\u2019s thought-images ( Denkbilder ), this course explores the  thresholds between image and text, intuition and reflection, literature and  philosophy. Other modernist authors to be read include Hofmannsthal, Robert  Walser, D\u00f6blin, Benn, Musil, and Broch.  SPRING  2011       V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We will  focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar.  V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature   - Paul Buchholz This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  V51.0240 \u2013 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways provided  radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the psyche. Writing  from the mid-19 th century through the 1930s, the three thinkers  placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions of the state, the  subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this course is to provide a  comprehensive engagement with the writings of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by  bringing them into dialogue with each other. That is, rather than reading the  three authors chronologically, the course is organized around six topoi \u2013  interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a  paradigmatic text from each author is read. The seminar underscores their  prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern  thinking.  V51.0253 \u2013 Topics in German Cinema: Faust and Film - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the theoretical responses to J. W. Goethe's  \"Faust I and II\" and the philosophy of tragedy. We will examine a  large body of cinematic work that re-releases the component parts of Goethe's  literary experiment. The course serves as an introduction to German studies,  media studies, and psychoanalysis. In English.  V51.0488  \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Ingeborg Bachmann - Paul Buchholz The Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973) composed a striking array of  provocative writing across a variety of literary genres. Her work voices  a deep discomfort the conventional operations of language, but also continually  revisits the hope that writing can bring about changes in the world. From  her early poetry and stories to her later work on the uncompleted \u201cTodesarten\u201d  novel-cycle, Bachmann offers reflections on a vast array of interwoven  concerns: remembrance of and opposition to war, the nature of time and  historical experience, the making of feminine the voice, economic inequality  and the persistence of fascist structures within the family, the limits and  possibilities of the individual voice. Moreover, Bachmann's multi-voiced  writing engages in an intense dialogue with major 20th century philosophers of  history and time (Walter Benjamin and Martin Heidegger). We will begin  with a study of Bachmann's poetry before moving on to radio plays, short  stories, lectures on poetics, and one uncompleted novel.  FALL 2010       V51.0111  - Conversation and Composition: Tatorte/Crime Scenes- Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for post Intermediate students of  German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to express, discuss, and argue opinions.  In addition, a thorough review of grammar will be part of our work. This  course explores narratives about crimes and crime scenes from the 1800s to  today in a variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, TV  series, paintings/photos, among others. Authors will include E.T.A.  Hoffmann, Franz Kafka, Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, Bertolt Brecht, Andrea Maria  Schenkel, Feuerbach and others. Questions of guilt, social and historical  underpinnings of crime stories, motives for crime, and the fascination with  solving riddles will accompany us throughout the semester.  While  engaging in the topic of crimes, we will work on writing and speaking skills  and hopefully also write our own crime or detective story. So don\u2019t be scared.  V51.0132  \u2013 German Culture, Politics &amp; Society   - Paul Buchholz Spectres of 1968: Afterlives of Political and Social Revolt In German culture, the year 1968 continues to haunt, irritate and inspire as a  time when society was supposed to change, suddenly and utterly. The  utopian and anti-war student movements of 1960s West Germany emerged amongst a  wide array of \"alternative\" ideas of political action, cultural  expression, historical remembering and communal living.  To explore the diversity of these ideas, we will embark on close and thoughtful  readings of a variety of written and visual materials, including films,  political essays, newspaper articles, songs, poetry, ethnography, one short  novel and a theatre piece. Authors will include Hans Magnus Enzensberger,  Ingeborg Bachmann, Peter Weiss, Peter Schneider, the activist Rudi Dutschke,  and Peter Handke. Our explorations will carry us through the 1970s and  80s, into the present, with study of the alternative communities in the  Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, and recent mainstream \"political\"  films that look back to the \"lost chances\" in German cultural history. In parallel to our readings, we will work to refine analytic and interpretive  writing in German through regular written assignments and a final paper.   This course is designed for students with a solid grasp of basic German  grammar and vocabulary, and will expand flexibility of expression in  German through ongoing and creative dialogue with the many voices that speak  about, and from within, a time of \"revolt.\" V51.0220 \u2013 Intro to German Thought &amp; Culture - Elke Siegel German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence upon the history  of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the art  movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of the  complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition. V51.0298 \u2013 Topics in 20th Century Lit: Playing &amp; Reality: Hamlet  in German Letters - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the German reception of Shakespeare's  \"Hamlet\" with an emphasis on its impact on 20th century thought. We  will consider general theoretical questions of translation in the German  context, the psychoanalytic paradigm of transference, ghostly transmission,  film and media responses, and common grounds between the German and  Anglo-American traditions. The course will serve as introduction to German  thought, comparative methods, psychoanalysis, and media analysis.  V51.0488 \u2013 Rilke\u2019s Lyrical Poetry - Eckart Goebel  This class is conceived to provide an introduction to the universe of Rilke\u2019s  Lyrical Poetry. By means of measured and careful close readings we will follow  the trajectory of Rilke\u2019s oeuvre, from the early poems to the late Duino  Elegies. Since Rilke excelled in many different forms and meters, this seminar  also serves as an introduction to \u201cVerslehre,\u201d including the study of random  phenomena like the prose poem. A special emphasis will be put on Rilke\u2019s theory  of \u201cthings\u201d as well on his art of description.  V51.0999  \u2013 Senior Honors Seminar   - Paul Fleming  SPRING 2010       V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature - Eckart  Goebel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. V51.0133 - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola  Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We  will focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar. V51.0253 - German Cinema: Crypto-fetishism and the Postwar Film - Viola  Kolarov We will focus on the psychoanalytic definition and evolution of the concept of  the fetish by examining the psychological effects of war on filmmaking in  Germany and beyond. As a product of trauma the techno-fetish contains a record  of failed mourning and a blueprint of group formation. We will base our  readings and discussion of psychoanalytic, philosophical, and literary texts on  postwar film made in the Federal Republic and Hollywood. V51.0216 - Scoring Literature: The Drug Culture - Avital Ronell This course is taught in English and originates in the Comparative Literature  Department and is crosslisted with the German Department. As a way to get  access to some of the most vital aspects of comparative literature and German  as fields, this course will explore the role of addiction, pharmacology,  intoxication, and poison in fiction, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Our  readings will take us to places where the motifs linked to drug cultures are  often concealed or repressed. During the course of the semester we will take a  close look at the pharmacodependency with which literature has been associated  historically--as sedative, as cure, as escape conduit or euphorizing substance,  as mimetic poisoning. In the cases of Baudelaire, Flaubert and James Joyce the  literary text was legally treated as a drug and run off the market by outraged  judges. We will analyze the legal documents that first declared these literary  works illicit, and then turned around those decisions. Some  of the questions that will be raised in class discussion include: What is the  relation of literature to law? How does the literary work become a medical  problem? Why has fiction been identified as part of a self-destructive drive?  What are the rhetorical strategies that render the poetic word, since the time  of Plato, socially inadmissible? We will read the relevant stimulants and works  of Kant, Heidegger, Derrida in philosophy, Freud and Lacan on destructive  pleasure, and explore the terrains opened up by Thomas De Quincey's  \"Confessions of an Opium Eater\" to Flaubert's \"Madame  Bovary,\" and Boroughs' and Dennis Coopers' works to see how imaginary  worlds collide with acts of legal and social policing. Prepare for the  intellectual rush of a lifetime! V51.0488 \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Bertolt Brecht - Elke  Siegel  Bertolt Brecht\u2019s profound and influential work as a poet and dramatist, as  theater director and theorist of the \u2018epic theater\u2019, as writer for radio and  film encapsulates history, political or literary-aesthetic, of the 20th  century, affording a unique perspective on the pervasive question of the  relationship between politics and art. Having celebrated his first successes in  the Weimar Republic, Brecht\u2019s major dramatic works were written in exile, while  upon his return to the GDR Brecht, with the Berlin Ensemble, was able to  realize a style of theatrical performance which is influential to this day. The  course aims, 1) to give an overview of Brecht\u2019s work in different genres \u2013  prose, poetry, drama, theory \u2013 ranging from the beginnings in the Weimar  Republic to the 1950s; 2) to touch upon trends and figures influencing Brecht  (e.g., the comedian Karl Valentin, avant-garde theater director Erwin Piscator,  mass sports events); and 3) to discuss the profound influence Brecht has  exerted on literature and theater (e.g., the dramatist and theater director  Heiner M\u00fcller).   FALL 2009  V51.0111  - Conversation/Composition: Berlin -   Elke Siegel Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with a solid grasp on  German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of the German  language, history, politics, and culture through reading, discussion and  writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a writing intensive course. This  course explores German culture, literature, and politics from the Weimar  Republic to the fall of the Wall and unification (1917-1990s) through an  examination of the city of Berlin. Topics include: the question of the  metropolis; the Weimar Republic; the Nazi dictatorship; rebuilding Berlin; two  Berlins; 1968; multiculturalism; the fall of the wall. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills,  developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as a thorough  review of grammar. We will work with a selection of written and visual  narratives, including literature (e.g., D\u00f6blin, Enzensberger, Delius, Brussig,  Wolf, \u00d6zdamar, Lange-M\u00fcller), historical, political and sociological texts  (e.g., Georg Simmel, Rudi Dutschke), journals, newspaper accounts, official  documents, architecture, and films/film clips (Berlin: Die Sinfonie der  Gro\u00dfstadt, Menschen am Sonntag, M, Kuhle Wampe, Berlin Alexanderplatz, Die  M\u00f6rder sind unter uns, Sonnenallee, Good Bye Lenin, Das Leben der Anderen).  V51.0153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation  through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation. Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be  distributed by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others.  V51.0249  - Intro to Cultural Studies -   Kathrin DiPaola An interdisciplinary tool kit to read realities The terms \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cCultural Studies\u201d have become magical formulas to  describe the intricacies of our presence. They are applied to explain and  investigate any angle of our multi-facetted social and historical realities  spanning from pop culture via business culture to even the culture of war. However, to fully understand the underlying definitions of the vast term  \u201cculture,\u201d it is necessary to comprehend its pluralistic lines of theoretical  tradition. Beginning with the framework of the Birmingham Center for Cultural  Studies in England and its most famous intellectual Stuart Hall, this course  brings together ideas from critical theory, cultural studies, film, and  literature to analyze the development and strategic use of discourses of race,  class, and gender in contemporary society. Bridging the gap between high  culture and street culture, the course offers students a basic,  interdisciplinary \u201ctool kit\u201d with which to read contemporary culture in its  literary, cinematic, and other popular forms.  V51.0244  - The German Intellectual Tradition: Critical Theory - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to German Critical Thought, beginning with its  roots in the 19th century (e.g., Marx and Nietzsche) and following its  trajectory to the Frankfurt School (e.g., Adorno, Benjamin) and beyond (e.g.,  Bakthin, Barthes). Established in 1930 at the Institute for Social Research,  the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a  pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European  social sciences, and continues to exert influence in contemporary social theory  and cultural studies. Often known simply as \u201cCritical Theory,\u201d their key works  cover a vast array of intellectual and political concerns, from the critique of  state capitalism, industrial society, and instrumental reason to commentaries  on mass culture, aesthetics, fashion, fascism, and psychoanalysis. The  interdisciplinary undertakings span many academic subjects and traditions of  economics, sociology, philosophy, literature, art, psychology, pol itics, and  history. In this course, we will begin with an examination of the central precursors to  Critical Theory in the 19thc and will then undertake a broad survey of the  major writings associated with the Frankfurt School as well as those written in  their wake. This introduction to the programmatic statements and eclectic  reflections of various scholars will highlight the diverse historical  influences, collaborative efforts, and internecine debates that shaped the  intellectual tradition across continents and generations. Authors include:  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Marcuse, and others.  V51.0390  - Topics in German Cinema: Creature    Features - Viola Kolarov We will examine some literary, philosophical, religious, and cinematic  contemplations of the creature while focusing on the ways in which the  individual and the mass media metabolize the creaturely in response to trauma.  V51.0999  - Senior Honors Seminar -   Dopico-Black  SPRING 2009  V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media through  an examination of the metropolis as a mirror of our contemporary media  experience. Topics include: the family; literary heritage; technical and occult  media; 20th century genres: thriller, dystopia, sci-fi, crime and drama. An  emphasis will be placed on refining written expression, honing listening and  reading skills, as well as a review of grammar .  V51.0152 - Intro to German Literature - Elke Siegel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of, e.g., hierarchy, love, authority.

This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the  art movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of  the complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition.  V51.0253 - Topics in German Cinema: Media &amp; Psychoanalysis   - Viola Kolarov This course explores the intersections between psychoanalysis and the media  emerging at the time of its conception, most notably film. Since the course  serves as an introduction to the theory and practice of psychoanalysis we will  examine our daily involvements and investments in both the mass media and  therapeutic practices that rely on our ability to communicate. We will read  texts from the classic Freudian tradition, literary works that inhabit the  psychoanalytic corpus, and watch a number of films from Germany and Hollywood  that tell the story of their -- and our -- development.    V51.0401 - Great Books in German: Twilight of the Idols - Eckart Goebel This seminar, conducted in German, is conceived as a careful, introduction to Friedrich  Nietzsche\u2019s highly influential thinking, and style. The first part will, after  an introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, provide a close reading of the  first book of Day Break (Morgenr\u00f6te), where Nietzsche develops his idea of a  strictly historical philosophy, and confronts us with his theory of culture.  The second part of this seminar will go step by step through Nietzsche\u2019s  attempt to summarize his entire philosophy in The Twilight of the Idols  (G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung). Finally we will read Nietzsche\u2019s essay on Truth and Lying  and conclude with the interpretation of some of his poems, the  Dionysos-Dithyramben. Copies of the German version of G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung may be  purchased at the NYU Bookstore. The other texts will be available in a reader.  Course requirements: Three written reading responses (2 pages each) and one  final paper (5 pages long).   FALL 2008  V51.0297  \u2013 Jews &amp; Germans, an Intercultural History - Paul North The relationship between German and Jewish cultures has historically been much  more complex than the \u201cand\u201d in the title of this course would lead us to  believe. Influence between the \u201ctwo\u201d cultures often flowed in both directions.  For instance, Enlightenment ideas in Germany strongly influenced the Jewish  Enlightenment or Haskala, while philosophers of the Enlightenment\u2014such as  Immanuel Kant\u2014took cues from a Jewish thinker, Moses Mendelssohn. Similarly,  debates over Jewish emancipation in the early nineteenth century corresponded  to a general opening of society that was part of the coalescence of German  national identity. In this course we will explore the complexities of an  affiliation that spoils the conception of culture as single and unified, based  on proprietary treasures deposited in \u201ca\u201d culture. Beginning with the late  eighteenth century we will consider literary, political, theological, and  philosophical texts, along with films, plays, and operas produced up to the eve  of World War II\u2014all of which represent struggles to understand the association  of the two names \u201cGerman\u201d and \u201cJew.\u201d Regarding names, you might also conceive  of this course as an attempt to come to terms with a statement made by Franz  Kafka, a German-speaking Jewish writer living in Prague in the early 20th  century. \u201cI have nothing in common with the Jews,\u201d he wrote, and then added: \u201cI  have nothing in common with Franz Kafka.\u201d Whatever else it might mean, the  statement expresses ambivalence toward unquestioned acceptance of an identity  such as \u201cZionist,\u201d \u201cassimilationist,\u201d \u201canti-Semite,\u201d and so forth. Instead  Kafka asks a more basic question: what does it mean to have \u201csomething in  common with\u201d \u2026 any proper name? This question will help guide our discussions.  The  Devil\u2019s Lectures - Laurence Rickels Vampire Professor Larry Rickels from UCSB (UC Sucks Blood) presents: THE DEVIL in  Ernest Jones, Freud, and Vilem Flusser, among other masters of  the university. Consideration of the syndications of the Devil's reign  in literature and film completes this tempting offering. Sign up of  your own free will.The medley of texts includes excerpts from THE DEVIL'S  ELIXIRS, THE DAMNED, NEEDFUL THINGS, PARADISE LOST, and CHILDHOOD'S END,  among many others. We begin with film clips from SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS  and THE RACE WITH THE DEVIL, rev up with clips from DEMONS and DEMONS 2,  and advance to the slow clip of such Luciferian works as INAUGURATION  OF THE PLEASURE DOME. In between we will also consider -- and exploit!  -- some of the better known Devil films.  Germany  Culture, Politics &amp; Society: Berlin 1900: Lifestyles - Viola Kolarov This course explores the culture, literature and language of Berlin at the turn  of the 20th century. Topics include mores and ethics, inheritance, mental  health, and contemporary tabloid culture. An emphasis will be placed on  refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, and reviewing  grammar and vocabulary.

Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  German  Intellectual Tradition: Friendship   - Elke Siegel The topic of friendship in recent years has experienced a renaissance.  Disciplines as different as anthropology, literary studies, philosophy, and  sociology have developed a new and invigorated interest in the theory and  practice of friendship as a utopia of a community of individuals differing  radically from those communities based on family or nation. Whereas friendship  was once defined by proximity, similarity, and mutuality, in modern  manifestations and discussions friendship tends towards distance, difference,  and asymmetry (see Derrida\u2019s Politics of Friendship ). The course  explores crucial reflections on friendship in changing contexts and discourses:  Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero), Montaigne\u2019s and Bacon\u2019s friendship essays  of the 17thcentury, the 18th century German \u2018cult of friendship\u2019 (Klopstock,  Schiller), and Romanticism(Tieck); the re-configurations of friendship in  modernity (Nietzsche, Kafka, Bernhard);sociology\u2019s investigation of the friend  as the locus of discretion and tact (Simmel); the notion of friendship as \u201ca  way of life\u201d (Foucault) and as a moral phenomenon (Blum) of particular  importance for feminism (Friedman).  Readings  in Contemporary Theory: Outrageous Texts   - Avital Ronell; Nicola Behrmann M.A. This class will explore over-the-top texts by means of contemporary theoretical  works of Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous and other crucial  writers and philosophers. This much can be said in anticipation: readings will  be slow and intense, at once fabulous and frustrating, because we no longer believe  in wrapping up the meaning of inexhaustible texts or achieving transparency. If  you need subtitles to understand this description, the class will provide them  for you. The texts will be mostly culled from the French, German, and English  canon, ranging from Kleist\u2019s MARQUISE OF O to Kathy Acker\u2019s version of DON  QUIXOTE, and including Werner Herzog\u2019s movie MY BEST FIEND.  FALL 2007  Techniques  of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation first hand,  students will encounter diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and  stylistic problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German  language. The course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and  complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as  well as written expression.  Composition  &amp; Conversation: Berlin(s)   -Yevgeniy Pomerantsev This course explores 20th (and 21st) century German culture through a focus on  the city of Berlin and its multiple incarnations as capital (Imperial Reich,  Weimar Republic, Nazi Reich, divided city, GDR and reunified Germany). We will  examine the birth of Germany's first modern metropolis and its subsequent  division and reunification after 1989, focusing also on the post-unification  phenomenon of \"Ostalgie.\" We will work with a variety of written and  visual narratives, including short stories, poetry, film, Feuilleton pieces,  and a novel.  Modern  German Drama - Elke Siegel  V51.0999  Senior Honors Seminar -   Elke Siegel  SPRING 2007       Germany  Culture, Politics and Society: Minority Cultures and Media , - Janelle Blankenship The course explores contemporary German culture, politics, and society, with  special focus on minority cultures and media. Topics include the \u2018Turkish  Turn\u2019 in contemporary German literature and film, Afro-German identity and  diasporic literature, and Holocaust memory. This course is designed for  students with a solid grasp of basic German grammar and vocabulary who wish to  extend their knowledge of German language, history, politics, and culture,  through reading, discussion, and writing.  Introduction  to German Literature   - Eckart Goebel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to  develop close and critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves  about literary texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering  the three major literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, and drama \u2013 some of the  following issues will be discussed: the depiction of otherness; the  representation of time and history; the uncanny; the relationship between form  and content; the economy of human relationships on the basis of hierarchy,  love, authority, among others.  European  Avant-garde Cinema   - Janelle Blankenship This course examines the history, politics, and aesthetics of European  avant-garde film. We will discuss concepts of political modernism, the  culture industry, and the aesthetics of shock. Diverse movements will be  considered, including Expressionism, Soviet Agit-prop, Dada, and Surrealism.  Post  1945 Literature Erinnerungs/Kulturen/Memory Cultures - Christopher Clark This course provides an overview of German literature, film, and culture since  1945, with an emphasis on the topic of memory. German culture after 1945 has been  preoccupied the memory of war, National Socialism, and the Holocaust; debates  among historians are front-page news, particularly the Historikerstreit   of the 1980s and the Goldhagen-Debatte of the 90s. Literature has been  an important vehicle for the process of Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung , or  coming to terms with the past, and we will discuss texts that both thematize  and perform acts of memory. We will examine various strategies of remembering  and memorializing the past, always asking what the significance of memory is  for the present and future. Furthermore, we will examine a range of memory  cultures, considering memories of the 1950s \"economic miracle,\" the  60s student movement and 70s radicalism, and the GDR and its demise, all of  which coexist and compete with memories of the war and the Holocaust in the  same cultural space. We will read texts and view films by such authors and  directors as Anna Seghers, Elisabeth Langg\u00e4sser, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heinrich  B\u00f6ll, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Margarethe von Trotta, Michael Verhoeven,  Benjamin Wilkomirski, W.G. Sebald, Thomas Brussig, Zafer Senocak, Bernhard  Schlink, and other contemporary writers. All readings, discussion, and writing  in German.  FALL 2006  1989  and Beyond - Christopher Clark 1989 and Beyond is designed for students with a solid grasp of basic German  grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of German language,  history, politics, and culture, through reading, discussion, and writing. It is  a writing-intensive course. This course will explore the literature, film, and  culture of Germany since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the (re-)unification  of East and West Germany in 1990. We will examine a range of aspects of the  culture of contemporary Germany and the \u201cBerlin Republic.\u201d We will work on  refining grammar, vocabulary, and style through frequent writing and revision.  We will work with a variety of written and visual narratives, including short  stories, poetry, newspaper articles, Feuilleton pieces, films, and a  book-length collection of stories.  Conversation  &amp; Composition: Friendship/s   - Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with a solid grasp of  German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of the German  language, history, and culture through reading, discussion and writing.  Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and writing intensive course. In  this course we will explore representations of friendship/s throughout German  culture from the classics (Goethe and Schiller) to today. The theme of  friendship has occupied writers and philosophers throughout history and is a  topic of current discussion in contemporary humanities. You are invited to read  a great variety of textual genres: ballads, poems, aphorisms, short stories, a  children\u2019s novel, and a theater play. Some of the following issues will guide  our investigation: difference between love and friendship, family and friends,  friends and foes; questions of gender [friendship between men and women, male  bonding, girlfriends], proof of friendship; betrayal, loyalty, idealization;  the question of power, and other problems that you may want to bring up.  Literature  and the Senses - Janelle  Blankenship This course explores twentieth-century German literature, as it strains to  hear, see, touch, and dream of new visions of time and space. We will study  fin-de-si\u00e8cle theories of perception, shock, and trauma (Freud, Ernst Mach,  Georg Simmel) and read naturalist novellas, fantasy novels, crime thrillers,  animal epics etc.  German  for Business - Cornelia Uhlenhaut This course is designed for students who have fulfilled their language  requirement and who wish to learn the terminology and conventions of German in  the business world. This is not a class on German economy per se; it rather  introduces students to the use of German language in professional situations,  thus emphasizing communicational and conversational language skills. In  addition to learning about contemporary Germany and its business culture, our  aim is to build and strengthen your vocabulary, your communication and  presentation skills and to refine your accuracy.   German  Poetry: Lyrical poetry from Goethe to Enzensberger - Eckart Goebel   SPRING 2006  German  Culture, Society, and Politics: From Ostzone to Ostalgie - Christopher Clark This course will explore the literature, culture, and politics of the German  Democratic Republic, commonly referred to as \"East Germany.\" From its  beginning as the Soviet-occupied zone to its foundation as a socialist republic  at the dawn of the Cold War, we will trace how artists and intellectuals  negotiated between their own utopian ideals and the often brutal reality of  daily life in a repressive regime. We will examine the Aufbaujahre of  the 1950s and the failed workers' uprising of 1953, as well as the massive flow  of people into the West, leading to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the  most (literally) concrete symbol of the Cold War. We will read the literature  of the relatively liberal early 70s and then explore the disastrous  consequences of the Wolf Biermann affair for artists and intellectuals in the  late 1970s. We will move on to the events leading to the fall of the Wall and  subsequent public debates over re/unification vs. a \"third way.\"  Finally, we will consider the cultural legacy of the GDR in the 1990s and  beyond, including the remainder of the so-called \"Mauer im Kopf\" and  the phenomenon of \"Ostalgie,\" a widespread nostalgia for many aspects  and artifacts of daily life in East Germany. Readings may include literature by  Bertolt Brecht, Stefan Hermlin, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf,  Irmtraud Morgner, Charlotte Worgitzky, Monika Maron, and Thomas Brussig; the  films Coming Out , Sonnenallee , and Good Bye Lenin! ; and a  range of short historical and non-fiction texts. All readings, discussion, and  writing in German.  Introduction  to German Literature   - Martin Sch\u00e4fer This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres - poetry, prose, drama - some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  Marx,  Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, three German  authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically new  understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the  origin of much modern thinking.  Early  German Cinema: Science/Sensation/Spectacle   - Janelle Blankenship This course will focus on the sensational origins of cinema in Germany.   We will examine cinema as part of a wider exhibition culture that includes  phantasmagoria ghost projection, magic lanterns, and the  \"edutainement\" of microscopes, X-rays and stereoscopes. Our analysis  of German cinema starts with the body madness of the \"Boxing  Kangaroo\" (from Max and Emil Skladanowsky's 1895 Wintergarten film  program) and ends with colonial cinema (Im deutschen Sudan) and German horror  classics ( Caligari, Genuine, Nosferatu! ). Rare glimpses into the  Skladanowsky retrospective of the Third Reich and a screening of New German  cinema representations of forgotten film pioneers also illuminate the act of  creating a national film history and archive .  Great  Books in German Literature: Technology, Tricks, and the Supernatural - Janelle Blankenship This course considers uncanny moments of magical tricks, technology, and the  supernatural in German literature and film. Diverse historical periods, genres,  and aesthetic styles will be analyzed by way of attention to the overarching  theme of this seminar. Texts include Goethe\u2019s Faust and ETA Hoffmann\u2019s Der  Sandmann . Films include Murnau\u2019s Faust (1926) and Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis   (1927).                                                                                               Back to Top"}]},

Conversation and Composition is a   reading, writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed   on refining written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the   ability to articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and   argue points of view; developing analytic and interpretive writing   skills; and encouraging flexibility of expression. In addition, a   thorough grammar review will be part of our work. During the course of   the semester we will explore the fascination with ghosts, ghostly   apparitions, scenes of dread, and haunted or scientifically inexplicable   events from the 1800s to today\u2014in particular, with the enduring   association of new technologies and electronic media with paranormal or   spiritual phenomena from a media or science and technologies studies   perspective. GERM-UA132 M, W 12:30 \u2013 1:45 Germany in Contemporary Cinema Alys George This post-intermediate course investigates how contemporary German cinema  has thematized recent German history. How have filmmakers approached topics  such as the resistance movements of World War II, postwar family life, East German  surveillance, the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jewish identity, social inequality  and injustice, the immigrant experience, and European unity? Directors\u2019  approaches to depicting 20th- and 21st-century Germany  history are diverse, surprising, deeply personal, and often humorous. You will  improve your language proficiency in speaking, writing, and listening, while  increasing your knowledge of German film, German history and culture, and film  techniques in general. Films by leading German directors will include Das  Leben der Anderen (2006), Berlin is in Germany (2001), Die  fetten Jahre sind vorbei (2004), Rosenstra\u00dfe (2003), Im  Juli (2000), and Das Wunder von Bern (2003). GERM-UA220 M, W 11:00 \u2013 12:15 Introduction to German Culture &amp; Thought: Luther to Nietzsche Christiane Frey How   is it that Martin Luther, the firebrand initiator of the Protestant   Reformation, could call for a liberation from the dogmatism of the   church and yet maintain that all men should obey secular authority? Why   do we generally hold that the philosopher and scientist G.W. Leibniz   stood at the beginning of modernity (and what, by the way, is   \u201cmodernity\u201d supposed to be?) despite the fact that he wrote a massive   volume on how to defend the existence of God? Is the Enlightenment   tolerant? Did Hegel really believe that the modern state should be   Christian? Could it be true that one can tell lies in an extra-moral   sense, to disfigure a title from Nietzsche? And last but not least: to   what use (or abuse) should one look into (intellectual) history? This   course will address these and other questions by exploring the history   of German thought and culture from the 16th to the 19th century.   Discussion will focus \u2013 at times perhaps in unconventional ways and   through the lens of modern theory \u2013 on some of the most prominent texts   of the canon of philosophy, theology, the sciences, and, of course,   literature. Beyond the authors mentioned, readings will also include   texts by Paracelsus, Johannes Kepler, Kant, Goethe, Kleist, and Rahel   Varnhagen. GERM-UA240 T, R 3:30 \u2013 4:45 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,   three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways   provided radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the   psyche. Writing from the mid-19th century through the 1930s, the three   thinkers placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions   of the state, the subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this   course is to provide a comprehensive engagement with the writings of   Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by bringing them into dialogue with each   other. That is, rather than reading the three authors chronologically,   the course is organized around six topoi \u2013 interpretation, history,   subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a paradigmatic text   from each author is read. The seminar underscores their prevailing   actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern   thinking. GERM-UA349 T, R 11:00 \u2013 12:15 German Romanticism: Speculative Technologies: The Literature of German Romanticism Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to German Romanticism, a movement that   grasped itself as a literary, philosophical and scientific watershed in   human history. Rather than following the traditional division between   early, high, and late Romanticism, we will track three figures in   Romanticism\u2019s multifaceted corpus: reflexivity, depth, and the social.   We will start with the emergence of the movement in Jena and its roots   in biological and philosophical discourses, where reflexivity plays a   crucial role in the fragmentary and novelistic writings of Friedrich and   August Wilhelm Schlegel, as well as Novalis and Ludwig Tieck. The   troubling figure of \u201cdepth\u201d will make up the second unit of inquiry, in   such figures as Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich Creuzer, and   Clemens Brentano. Deploying both of these techniques, Heinrich von   Kleist, E. T. A. Hoffmann and Heinrich Heine bring Romantic techniques   to bear on the changing fabric of the social, revealing Romanticism as a   technically concrete and simultaneously speculative response to the   increasingly complexity of modern life. GERM-UA283 (HBRJD-UA685 ) T, R 3:30-4:45 The Holocaust: The Third Reich and the Jews David Engel This   lecture course is an historical investigation of the evolution of Nazi   policies toward Jews; of Jewish behavior in the face of those policies;   and of the attitudes of other countries, both within and outside the   Nazi orbit, for the situation of Jews under the rule of the Third Reich.   GERM-UA999 T 9:30 - 12:30 Senior Honors Seminar Ara Merjian GERM-UA501 TBD Honors Thesis Alys George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2014  GERM-UA133 -  German  Culture 1890 \u2013 1989: Nationalism,  Industrialization, and War: Germany, 1890-1945  - Chadwick Smith This course examines the interaction between German literature and other  social institutions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will  investigateGerman responses to rapidly changing technological, economic, and  material conditions following the failed revolutions and continuing through  German unification and industrialization, and culminating in the First World  War. We will also consider how literature and theoretical writing provide a  site inwhich to imagine social change, as we examine a variety of conflicts  between traditional social norms and new conceptions of self and society, and  trace the evolution of conceptions of social class, gender and identity and the  anxiety such developments inspired. Readings will include selections from:  Benjamin, Brecht, Fontane, Freud, Musil, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Simmel.  GERM-UA152 -  Intro to German Literature  - Leif Weatherby Required for the German major. Introduces  students to representative authors and works of German literature, with  emphasis on the modern period. Students learn basic conventions of literature  and literary interpretation, as well as strategies for the effective reading of  shorter and longer prose works, drama, and poetry. Guided writing assignments  focus on developing the language skills necessary for effective written  analysis and interpretation of literary texts in German.  GERM-UA244 - German  Intellectual Tradition: The Myth of the Machine. From Divine Automata  to the Internet - Leif Weatherby We live in a world of technological mediation. Devices provide us with the  rules--for geographical orientation, fordating, for knowing the weather. Do we  use our devices, or do they use us? The question is old, and this course looks  at cultures of machines from the Early Modern period to the present. It will  proceed thematically, treating problems in historical technological cultures  like computers (Pascal, Babbage, Kittler), automata (Vaucanson, Hoffmann,  Helmholtz, Merimee, \u010capek), divine machines (Leibniz, Jean Paul, Wiener,  G\u00fcnther), the advent of film (M\u00fcnsterberg, Lang, Benjamin), animals/humans and  \"the tool\" (Geroi-Lourhan, Heidegger, Darwin/Marx, Engels, Kapp,  Samuel Butler) and the so-called \"megamachine\" of modern society  (J\u00fcnger, Mumford). The framework will be the negative anthropology tradition  between Herder and Gehlen and the reversal of the myth from the extension of  human powers to the primacy of the technological. The shared conviction of  nearly all these authors is that culture must reflect on its machines--and on  itself as a machine-like entity--in order to survive .  GERM-UA249 -  Intro to Theory : Critical Theory from Plato to  Adorno and Beyond  - Alan Itkin With Plato\u2019s Republic , critical theory begins with a bang: Plato  bans poets from his ideal republic, telling us that they are nothing but liars  corrupting those who read their works. Poetry, Plato writes, is misleading  because it is nothing but a copy of a copy, an imitation of the mere appearance  of reality. The two questions Plato links together\u2014what is literature, and what  is it good for?\u2014have been at the center of critical theory ever since, and the  answers theorists give to the one are almost always implicitly answers to the  other as well. In this course we will trace these questions from the classical  period to the present with the help of theorists including Plato, Aristotle,  Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Zizek. We will  examine and develop the principles and methods we use to analyze and interpret  literature and the other arts, because there can be no interpretation without  theoretical assumptions. As another critical theorist, Paul de Man, has told  us, the resistance to theory is itself a form of theory.  GERM-UA487 -  Seminar on 19th Century Literature: Staging  Revolt in German Drama  - Chadwick Smith This course examines German drama from the late 18th and early 19th centuries,  when discourses of rights and the equal application of law supplant other  ethical and political discourses, a shift that requires a revised relationship  between the individual human subject and the state. Giving a political role to  aesthetics, the stage becomes the public venue in which these reconfigurations  are played out. The focus is on the partisans\u2014on G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, Karl  Moor, Hermann, and Danton. An analysis of these figures allows for a  delineation of the borders of state violence. These works raise questions the  contours of sovereignty. What rights do citizens have over and above those  granted by the State? What right to revolt? What power do those outside of the  political order wield? How do states attempt to contain dissent or brand it  terror? These questions will structure the course and identify parallels to the  contemporary world.  FALL 2013 GERM-UA153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation.      Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will  be distributed by the instructor. Materials may include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate one or more longer prose texts (TBD) from German to English as a  class. This work will accompany our course throughout the semester. GERM-UA111 - Conversation/Composition: Taking Sides in  Berlin - A Century of Debates in and about a Divided City -  Chadwick Smith  The course follows Berlin\u2019s course through the  tumultuous 20th century, in which Berlin can rightfully be said to have played  the central, starring role. By attending to a series of representative and  debates and divisions that came to define the century, we will tour a city  riven by the forces of industrialization and rapid growth, torn asunder by war,  physically divided in two during the cold war, and finally reunified to emerge  as a multicultural world capital. When possible, we will trace the historical public and private divisions  forward to the forms they take in contemporary Berlin, a magnet for an  international creative class and setting for very contemporary debates over  memorialization, race and ethnicity, and art. Toward this goal, we will engage  with and comment upon them through the lens of news and entertainment media.  We will work with a variety of written (short  stories, poetry, newspaper articles, feuilleton , and a novel) and visual  sources including film, visual art, and architecture and design. At the same  time, we will learn to write in various genres such as the news report,  commentary or feuilleton , and film or book review. Toward these goals, we will also  address the development of the various media\u2019s role in society, and the way in  which changing media technologies affect interaction with culture and language.   Conversation and Composition is designed for  students with a solid grasp on German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of German language, history, politics, and culture, through  reading, discussion, and writing. All readings, discussion, and written work  for the course will be in German. We will work on refining written and spoken  expression with particular focus on the ability to articulate opinions,  exchange substantive information, and argue points of view; developing analytic  and interpretive writing skills; and expanding students\u2019 linguistic toolkit. A  thorough grammar review will thus necessarily be part of our work.  GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition:  Literature, the Sciences &amp; Philosophy: Kepler to Kleist - Christiane  Frey  How did the  sciences, philosophy, and literature interact and influence one another on the  way to becoming the discrete pursuits they are today? This course will approach  this question by tracing a series of entanglements that challenge our sense of  what knowledge is. We will explore, for example, why Kepler wrote a dream  narrative to promote his scientific discoveries; how Leibniz\u2019s philosophy was  shaped by the microscope and romances; how the modern novel aligns with  statistics. We will retrace the birth of a new science called \u201caesthetics,\u201d  investigate how Goethe\u2019s affinity to chemistry changed his way of writing, and  discuss how the romantic concept of science might question our idea of the  humanities and the sciences as \u201ctwo cultures.\u201d Finally, we will ask how all  these \u201ccases\u201d are connected and what they tell us about the distinctions we  rely on to produce knowledge.   GERM-UA366 -  20th Century Prose: Women\u2019s Voices from Germany and Austria - Alys George  This course introduces you to prose works by a selection  of the most influential 20th-century women writers from Germany and Austria  (among them Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9, Anna Seghers, Ingeborg Bachmann, Christa Wolf,  and the Nobel Prize-winners Elfriede Jelinek and Herta M\u00fcller). We consider  what constitutes Frauenliteratur, \u201cwomen\u2019s writing,\u201d but also think through  major historical topics of the past century as represented in literary texts by  female authors. These include: the role of women at the fin de si\u00e8cle; the New  Woman in the Weimar Republic; life under National Socialism; women\u2019s roles in  post-WWII reconstruction; gender roles in the Communist bloc; the women\u2019s  liberation movement; immigrant and minority discourses; and the status of  gender and sexuality as reflected by contemporary media. Genres covered will  include autobiography, short story, novella, and novel.   GERM-UA283 - Topics: The Portrait -  Christopher Wood A portrait is a depiction or description of a real individual. Portraiture  faces a series of conceptual challenges: how much information is necessary to  secure reference to the portrayed person? how is the effect of likeness  achieved? what is, in the end, \u201cindividual\u201d about a human being? All cultures  in all times have produced portraits. Portraiture reveals how a culture thinks  about persons, selves, and souls. Some portraits are also works of art; how  does this change the game? The seminar will approach a wide range of examples,  pictorial and textual, from a variety of perspectives. Topics will include:  portraits of holy men and women (icons); tomb portraits; portrait photography;  portraits and the state (royal effigies, defamatory portraits, ID cards);  verbal portraits; the portrait as a theme in fiction; biography and  autobiography; portraits and the performance of self; studio models.   GERM-UA999 \u2013  Senior Honors Seminar - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby   GERM-UA501 \u2013  Honors Thesis - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2013  GERM-UA152 - Introduction to Literature - Arne Hoecker   This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to  a selection of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written  in German language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close  and critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. All  readings in German.  GERM-UA185 - Introduction to German Poetry: Das Ich und  das Ding - Leif Weatherby  This course introduces the long tradition of German lyric  poetry. Lyric is usually associated with the sentimental and experiential  subject, longing for the completeness of nature or the embrace of a lover. The  lyric subject, however, is constantly confronted by a world of things, and  these things are inflected by the gender of the poet. From the thing-like  nature of the beloved in niedere (but also ebene ) Minne in  the medieval tradition to the \u201cthing-poems\u201d of Rainer Maria Rilke to the  eviscerated and partial objects of Paul Celan, lyric reveals itself as the  genre of the (gendered) subject in a world of objects. We will read poems from  one female and one male poet in five periods: Medieval (Hildegard von Bingen,  Walter von der Vogelweide); Early Modern (Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg,  Andreas Gryphius); Romanticism (Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin); Modernism (Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Rainer Maria Rilke); and post-WWII  (Ingeborg Bachmann; Paul Celan). Throughout the German lyric corpus, we will  ask ourselves, what is an \u201cI\u201d? To whom and to what gender does this \u201cI\u201d belong?  And how is it mediated by the thing-world? All readings in German. GERM-UA240 -  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Arne Hoecker This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically  new understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin  of much modern thinking.  GERM-UA347 -  German Enlightenment: Vernunft und Schrecken - Leif Weatherby The German \u201cEnlightenment\u201d was and is a controversial hybrid.  The growth of communications technologies across Europe put the fragmented  German-speaking lands into self-perceived cultural, scientific, and  philosophical competition and dialogue with other European nations. In  literature, poets from Albrecht von Haller to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing to  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe struggled to establish a \u201cGerman\u201d paradigm to match  the philosophical and poetic cultures in France, England, and Scotland. From  the start, they maintained the combination of literature, philosophy, and  science, often mixing these apparently distinct spheres for the purposes of  fostering a unified \u201cnation.\u201d This course looks at Enlightenment as a  cross-disciplinary attempt to fashion a culture of \u201creason,\u201d and asks a  question: how does reason deal with its weightiest uncanny counterpart, terror?  Starting with Newton and Leibniz, we will read the philosophical-aesthetic  debates of the 1740s (Bodmer, Gottsched, von Haller), the attempt at  Germanification of tragedy as a philosophical form of literature in the 1750s  (Lessing, Mendelssohn, Nicolai), and the late but leading Enlightener Immanuel  Kant and his natural-scientific counterpart, Johann Blumenbach. We will also  discuss such reactions to \u201cEnlightenment\u201d as Wieland\u2019s \u201csensibility\u201d ( Empfindsamkeit )  movement, the Storm and Stress ( Sturm und Drang) , Lavater\u2019s Physiognomie ,  and Winckelmann's as well as Goethe's and Schiller\u2019s classicism. Throughout, we  will see how the emergent hybrid \u201creason\u201d confronts political and aesthetic  (and even natural-scientific) terrors, and how it\u2014perhaps\u2014produces some of its  own. All readings in German .  GERM-UA283 (This course originates in History-  cross-listed as HIST-UA 283 ) - The Origin of Humanity: History of a  Modern Obsession - Stefanos Geroulanos In its attempt to reexamine and reinterpret the sources and  consequences of human knowledge, the Enlightenment irrevocably displaced the  widely accepted biblical explanation of the origin of man, his creation in the  image and resemblance of God. With this displacement was born, or reborn, a largely  new set of questions: Where does man come from? What was early humanity like?  How has mankind changed or progressed since those early times? How long ago  were those early times? Did culture proper emerge in Greece? In India? At a  historical fount of races and nations? In \u201cprimitive\u201d culture? Which origin  should be taken most seriously\u2014that of the human species, or that of modern  culture? Were the \u201cearly times\u201d a kind of utopia that needs to be recaptured?  And given change and progress, where is mankind today, and where is it going?  What would be the effect of seeking to reconstitute, to bring about, a society  based on this origin? These questions, and the history of the answers offered to  them, will be at the heart of our course. At its most general level, the course  is an introduction and overview of major themes in modern European intellectual  history, focusing on the modern obsession with re-divining and often re-living the  origins of man. We will be concerned with both philosophical texts and  scientific efforts to identify and clarify this origin, with the political  implications of such origins, and not least with efforts to identify who (which  discipline? which political party?) should have authority for determining and  using \u201cthe origin.\u201d We will read some of the crucial texts in the period from  the 1750s to the 1960s, tracing the answers offered by philosophers,  anthropologists, biologists, linguists, and poets. FALL 2012 GERM-UA455 - Goethe - Arne H\u00f6cker This course offers insight into one of the big shots of  German literature: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) is the icon of the  bourgeois artist and universal genius, an Enlightenment philosopher, a  researcher of nature, a poet, and a minister in the state of Weimar. This  course will examine Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. We will  read and discuss Goethe\u2019s prose, poetry, and dramatic work from the late  Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond. In addition,  we will acquaint ourselves with Goethe\u2019s autobiographic and scientific  writings. GERM-UA145 - Viennese Modernism: Love, Madness, Death   - Alys George This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the  culture of turn-of-the-century Vienna, one of the birthplaces of  twentieth-century modernism. The works of Austrian writers, artists,  architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the  political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from  a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama),  film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of  this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by  and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include  Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold  Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl.  This course is a 100-level, post-intermediate course in German, which will also  focus on language acquisition at the advanced level. A portion of the course  will involve visits to museums in New York. GERM-UA111 - Conversation and Composition: Von Geistern,  Gespenstern und anderen merkw\u00fcrdigen Gestalten/Of ghosts and other curious  creatures (taught in German) - Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with  a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their  knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as  a thorough review of grammar. This course explores the fascination with ghosts, ghostly  apparitions, and haunted scenes in the arts from the 1800s to today in a  variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, maybe opera,  paintings/photos, music, popular culture, etc. Authors will include Johann  Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, Johann Peter Hebel, E.T.A. Hoffmann,  Theodor Storm, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Thomas Mann, Marie-Luise  Kaschnitz, Yoko Tawada, Inka Parei, among others. The question why we are fascinated  by the scientifically inexplicable and how it was treated in the arts to this  day will accompany us throughout the semester. Please don\u2019t be scared. GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition: Do the  Revolution: German Culture and Revolutionary Violence - Leif Weatherby Germany has never had a successful revolution. Its culture,  however, has been obsessed with violence and systemic political change from  Luther to the violent leftist groups of the Federal Republic. The external and  passive revolutions that dissolved the feudal system in Germany led the poet  H\u00f6lderlin to call the Germans \u201cthought-rich and deed-poor.\u201d This course will  make a positive of what Marx called the \u201cGerman Ideology,\u201d focusing on the  productive anxieties of a figure of fascination: revolutionary violence.  Starting with Luther\u2019s rejection of the Peasants\u2019 War, we will consider the  French Revolution among the Romantics, the revolutions of 1848 among the Young  Hegelians and Marx, the Russian revolutions among the Expressionists, violence  and art in and around National Socialism, and the anti-capitalist violence of  the RAF and the Baader-Meinhof Group, among others. We will finish the course  with theoretical considerations of the meaning of revolution in contemporary  geopolitics. Authors include: Luther, Hegel, Kleist, Marx, Luxemburg, Toller,  J\u00fcnger, Fassbinder, and Zizek.  SPRING  2012   GERM-UA.133  - German Culture 1890 - 1989: German/Jewish: Negotiating Identity in Post-1945  Literature &amp; Culture -   Alys George This course explores how authors of Jewish heritage in Germany and  Austria have probed the boundaries of identity after 1945. By introducing  students to a range of critical questions and forms of cultural production, the  course aims is to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of  German-Jewish and Austrian-Jewish experience and their contemporary  representations. Central questions will include: can \u201cJewishness,\u201d \u201cGermanness,\u201d or  \u201cAustrianness\u201d be defined? What constitutes \u201cJewish writing\u201d? How are Jewish  identity, experience, and culture \u201ctranslated\u201d into literature and film? How do  Jewish authors perceive their role in contemporary German and Austrian society  and public discourse? What role do the remembrance of the past (in particular,  of the Shoah), the politics of the present, and day-to-day minority experiences  play in public/political discourse and cultural production?  This  questioning is set against the background of the exclusions and atrocities that  shaped German and Austrian society and their relation to those deemed \u2018other\u2019  in the twentieth century. The course will cover topics such as autobiography and exile, language and  gender, memory and \u201cpostmemory\u201d in the cultural production of writers of Jewish  heritage in the German language. Written and visual texts by first-generation  survivors such as Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs, Ilse Aichinger, Edgar Hilsenrath,  and Ruth Kl\u00fcger, as well as by second-generation writers like Barbara  Honigmann, Doron Rabinovici, Maxim Biller, and Esther Dischereit form the core  of the course. These texts will be discussed in connection with theoretical  approaches. Genres will include poetry, drama, autobiography and memoir, short  stories, non-fiction, the novel, and film.  GERM-UA.152  \u2013 Introduction to German Literature   -Arne Hoecker This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection  of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  GERM-UA244  \u2013 German Intellectual Tradition: The Failure of Human Dignity - Chadwick Smith During the long 19th century, literature and philosophy informed the  Enlightenment project of human freedom and emancipation while simultaneously  staging its failure. Starting with Hannah Arendt\u2019s The Origins of  Totalitarianism (1951) and taking the notion of the \u201cperplexities\u201d of modern  human rights as a guiding framework, we will read canonical 19th-century German  literary texts from Goethe to Kafka and place them into dialog with theoretical  and philosophical reflections from the 19th and 20th centuries (Hegel, Marx,  Ranciere, Agamben) in order to explore the problems inherent both within human  rights and in defining the category of the human itself.  GERM-UA.397  \u2013 Topics in 19th Century Literature: Literature and Criminality - Arne Hoecker This course will focus on 19th century German literature by examining the  various intersections between cultural, social and scientific discourse. We  will study literary representations of crime from Romanticism to Realism and  Naturalism, looking at questions of form, genre, and narrativity. In addition,  we will confront these literary representations with judicial and psychological  definitions of criminality, and study their interrelation at the level of  narrative strategies invoked in the portrayal of the criminal.  FALL  2011       GERM-UA.0111  - Conversation and Composition \u2013 Berlin: Metropolis &amp; Metamorphosis - Alys George  Conversation and Composition is designed for post-intermediate students  of German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to  expand on their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through  reading, discussion, and writing. Conversation and Composition is a reading,  writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining  written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the ability to  articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and argue points of  view; developing analytic and interpretive writing skills; and encouraging  flexibility of expression. In addition, a thorough grammar review will be part  of our work. If  Walter Benjamin called Paris the capital of the nineteenth century, Berlin was  in many ways the capital of the twentieth century. The city became a stage for  remarkable shifts and ruptures that occurred between 1900 and 2000, and this  course explores a century of radical cultural, historical, and political  change. Berlin was, by turns, imperial capital; hothouse for the Weimar  Republic\u2019s avant-garde impulses; National Socialism\u2019s imagined \u201cGermania\u201d;  post-World War II divided city; Cold War capital of the GDR; and, today,  capital of a reunified Germany.  We  will take a cultural studies approach to twentieth-century Berlin and learn how  to effectively \u201cread\u201d and interpret textual and visual materials. This course  is designed to be interdisciplinary, so we will work with a variety of written  genres (poetry, short stories, novel, journalistic non-fiction), visual art,  architecture, and film. Authors will include Walter Benjamin, Alfred D\u00f6blin,  Inge Deutschkron, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf, Peter Schneider, Katja  Lange-M\u00fcller, Durs Gr\u00fcnbein, Monika Maron, Zafer Senocak, and Wladimir Kaminer.  Film materials will include Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Gro\u00dfstadt [1927], Berlin  Alexanderplatz , Die M\u00f6rder sind unter uns , Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin ,   Sonnenallee , Berlin: Sinfonie einer Gro\u00dfstadt [2002], and Das  Leben der Anderen .  GERM-UA.0153  - Techniques of Translation   - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students  will encounter diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic  problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The  course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic  structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as well as written  expression. A background reader in English will familiarize students with  historical and theoretical implications of translation. Photocopies  of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be distributed  by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine articles; recipes;  TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical articles; pop  material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts: prose,  theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate a longer prose text (TBD) from German to English as a class. This  work will accompany our course throughout the semester.  GERM-UA.0244  - The Age of angst : German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1939 - Alys George  This course explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and  anxiety that pervaded German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and  early twentieth centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of  war, rapid industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the  political and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the  very bedrock upon which society had been built. The intellectual and aesthetic  responses to this pervasive sense of angst and upheaval, as well as the  challenges and changes themselves, form the focus of this course. We will  reflect in depth on how the intellectual impulses informed aesthetic innovation  as we explore the meaning and nature of modernity and crisis in early  twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will include Nietzsche, Freud,  Loos, Simmel, Weber, Benjamin, Heidegger, and Kracauer.  GERM-UA.0366  - 20th Century Prose: Miniatures of Modernity from Nietzsche to Benjamin - Arne H\u00f6cker German and Austrian writers from the turn of the century to the Weimar  Republic experimented with genres of short prose as a privileged literary form  to express philosophical thought and cultural criticism. Through close readings  of German short prose pieces from Nietzsche\u2019s aphorisms to Kafka\u2019s parables,  and Benjamin\u2019s thought-images ( Denkbilder ), this course explores the  thresholds between image and text, intuition and reflection, literature and  philosophy. Other modernist authors to be read include Hofmannsthal, Robert  Walser, D\u00f6blin, Benn, Musil, and Broch.  SPRING  2011       V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We will  focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar.  V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature   - Paul Buchholz This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  V51.0240 \u2013 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways provided  radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the psyche. Writing  from the mid-19 th century through the 1930s, the three thinkers  placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions of the state, the  subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this course is to provide a  comprehensive engagement with the writings of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by  bringing them into dialogue with each other. That is, rather than reading the  three authors chronologically, the course is organized around six topoi \u2013  interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a  paradigmatic text from each author is read. The seminar underscores their  prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern  thinking.  V51.0253 \u2013 Topics in German Cinema: Faust and Film - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the theoretical responses to J. W. Goethe's  \"Faust I and II\" and the philosophy of tragedy. We will examine a  large body of cinematic work that re-releases the component parts of Goethe's  literary experiment. The course serves as an introduction to German studies,  media studies, and psychoanalysis. In English.  V51.0488  \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Ingeborg Bachmann - Paul Buchholz The Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973) composed a striking array of  provocative writing across a variety of literary genres. Her work voices  a deep discomfort the conventional operations of language, but also continually  revisits the hope that writing can bring about changes in the world. From  her early poetry and stories to her later work on the uncompleted \u201cTodesarten\u201d  novel-cycle, Bachmann offers reflections on a vast array of interwoven  concerns: remembrance of and opposition to war, the nature of time and  historical experience, the making of feminine the voice, economic inequality  and the persistence of fascist structures within the family, the limits and  possibilities of the individual voice. Moreover, Bachmann's multi-voiced  writing engages in an intense dialogue with major 20th century philosophers of  history and time (Walter Benjamin and Martin Heidegger). We will begin  with a study of Bachmann's poetry before moving on to radio plays, short  stories, lectures on poetics, and one uncompleted novel.  FALL 2010       V51.0111  - Conversation and Composition: Tatorte/Crime Scenes- Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for post Intermediate students of  German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to express, discuss, and argue opinions.  In addition, a thorough review of grammar will be part of our work. This  course explores narratives about crimes and crime scenes from the 1800s to  today in a variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, TV  series, paintings/photos, among others. Authors will include E.T.A.  Hoffmann, Franz Kafka, Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, Bertolt Brecht, Andrea Maria  Schenkel, Feuerbach and others. Questions of guilt, social and historical  underpinnings of crime stories, motives for crime, and the fascination with  solving riddles will accompany us throughout the semester.  While  engaging in the topic of crimes, we will work on writing and speaking skills  and hopefully also write our own crime or detective story. So don\u2019t be scared.  V51.0132  \u2013 German Culture, Politics &amp; Society   - Paul Buchholz Spectres of 1968: Afterlives of Political and Social Revolt In German culture, the year 1968 continues to haunt, irritate and inspire as a  time when society was supposed to change, suddenly and utterly. The  utopian and anti-war student movements of 1960s West Germany emerged amongst a  wide array of \"alternative\" ideas of political action, cultural  expression, historical remembering and communal living.  To explore the diversity of these ideas, we will embark on close and thoughtful  readings of a variety of written and visual materials, including films,  political essays, newspaper articles, songs, poetry, ethnography, one short  novel and a theatre piece. Authors will include Hans Magnus Enzensberger,  Ingeborg Bachmann, Peter Weiss, Peter Schneider, the activist Rudi Dutschke,  and Peter Handke. Our explorations will carry us through the 1970s and  80s, into the present, with study of the alternative communities in the  Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, and recent mainstream \"political\"  films that look back to the \"lost chances\" in German cultural history. In parallel to our readings, we will work to refine analytic and interpretive  writing in German through regular written assignments and a final paper.   This course is designed for students with a solid grasp of basic German  grammar and vocabulary, and will expand flexibility of expression in  German through ongoing and creative dialogue with the many voices that speak  about, and from within, a time of \"revolt.\" V51.0220 \u2013 Intro to German Thought &amp; Culture - Elke Siegel German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence upon the history  of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the art  movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of the  complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition. V51.0298 \u2013 Topics in 20th Century Lit: Playing &amp; Reality: Hamlet  in German Letters - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the German reception of Shakespeare's  \"Hamlet\" with an emphasis on its impact on 20th century thought. We  will consider general theoretical questions of translation in the German  context, the psychoanalytic paradigm of transference, ghostly transmission,  film and media responses, and common grounds between the German and  Anglo-American traditions. The course will serve as introduction to German  thought, comparative methods, psychoanalysis, and media analysis.  V51.0488 \u2013 Rilke\u2019s Lyrical Poetry - Eckart Goebel  This class is conceived to provide an introduction to the universe of Rilke\u2019s  Lyrical Poetry. By means of measured and careful close readings we will follow  the trajectory of Rilke\u2019s oeuvre, from the early poems to the late Duino  Elegies. Since Rilke excelled in many different forms and meters, this seminar  also serves as an introduction to \u201cVerslehre,\u201d including the study of random  phenomena like the prose poem. A special emphasis will be put on Rilke\u2019s theory  of \u201cthings\u201d as well on his art of description.  V51.0999  \u2013 Senior Honors Seminar   - Paul Fleming  SPRING 2010       V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature - Eckart  Goebel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. V51.0133 - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola  Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We  will focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar. V51.0253 - German Cinema: Crypto-fetishism and the Postwar Film - Viola  Kolarov We will focus on the psychoanalytic definition and evolution of the concept of  the fetish by examining the psychological effects of war on filmmaking in  Germany and beyond. As a product of trauma the techno-fetish contains a record  of failed mourning and a blueprint of group formation. We will base our  readings and discussion of psychoanalytic, philosophical, and literary texts on  postwar film made in the Federal Republic and Hollywood. V51.0216 - Scoring Literature: The Drug Culture - Avital Ronell This course is taught in English and originates in the Comparative Literature  Department and is crosslisted with the German Department. As a way to get  access to some of the most vital aspects of comparative literature and German  as fields, this course will explore the role of addiction, pharmacology,  intoxication, and poison in fiction, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Our  readings will take us to places where the motifs linked to drug cultures are  often concealed or repressed. During the course of the semester we will take a  close look at the pharmacodependency with which literature has been associated  historically--as sedative, as cure, as escape conduit or euphorizing substance,  as mimetic poisoning. In the cases of Baudelaire, Flaubert and James Joyce the  literary text was legally treated as a drug and run off the market by outraged  judges. We will analyze the legal documents that first declared these literary  works illicit, and then turned around those decisions. Some  of the questions that will be raised in class discussion include: What is the  relation of literature to law? How does the literary work become a medical  problem? Why has fiction been identified as part of a self-destructive drive?  What are the rhetorical strategies that render the poetic word, since the time  of Plato, socially inadmissible? We will read the relevant stimulants and works  of Kant, Heidegger, Derrida in philosophy, Freud and Lacan on destructive  pleasure, and explore the terrains opened up by Thomas De Quincey's  \"Confessions of an Opium Eater\" to Flaubert's \"Madame  Bovary,\" and Boroughs' and Dennis Coopers' works to see how imaginary  worlds collide with acts of legal and social policing. Prepare for the  intellectual rush of a lifetime! V51.0488 \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Bertolt Brecht - Elke  Siegel  Bertolt Brecht\u2019s profound and influential work as a poet and dramatist, as  theater director and theorist of the \u2018epic theater\u2019, as writer for radio and  film encapsulates history, political or literary-aesthetic, of the 20th  century, affording a unique perspective on the pervasive question of the  relationship between politics and art. Having celebrated his first successes in  the Weimar Republic, Brecht\u2019s major dramatic works were written in exile, while  upon his return to the GDR Brecht, with the Berlin Ensemble, was able to  realize a style of theatrical performance which is influential to this day. The  course aims, 1) to give an overview of Brecht\u2019s work in different genres \u2013  prose, poetry, drama, theory \u2013 ranging from the beginnings in the Weimar  Republic to the 1950s; 2) to touch upon trends and figures influencing Brecht  (e.g., the comedian Karl Valentin, avant-garde theater director Erwin Piscator,  mass sports events); and 3) to discuss the profound influence Brecht has  exerted on literature and theater (e.g., the dramatist and theater director  Heiner M\u00fcller).   FALL 2009  V51.0111  - Conversation/Composition: Berlin -   Elke Siegel Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with a solid grasp on  German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of the German  language, history, politics, and culture through reading, discussion and  writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a writing intensive course. This  course explores German culture, literature, and politics from the Weimar  Republic to the fall of the Wall and unification (1917-1990s) through an  examination of the city of Berlin. Topics include: the question of the  metropolis; the Weimar Republic; the Nazi dictatorship; rebuilding Berlin; two  Berlins; 1968; multiculturalism; the fall of the wall. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills,  developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as a thorough  review of grammar. We will work with a selection of written and visual  narratives, including literature (e.g., D\u00f6blin, Enzensberger, Delius, Brussig,  Wolf, \u00d6zdamar, Lange-M\u00fcller), historical, political and sociological texts  (e.g., Georg Simmel, Rudi Dutschke), journals, newspaper accounts, official  documents, architecture, and films/film clips (Berlin: Die Sinfonie der  Gro\u00dfstadt, Menschen am Sonntag, M, Kuhle Wampe, Berlin Alexanderplatz, Die  M\u00f6rder sind unter uns, Sonnenallee, Good Bye Lenin, Das Leben der Anderen).  V51.0153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation  through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation. Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be  distributed by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others.  V51.0249  - Intro to Cultural Studies -   Kathrin DiPaola An interdisciplinary tool kit to read realities The terms \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cCultural Studies\u201d have become magical formulas to  describe the intricacies of our presence. They are applied to explain and  investigate any angle of our multi-facetted social and historical realities  spanning from pop culture via business culture to even the culture of war. However, to fully understand the underlying definitions of the vast term  \u201cculture,\u201d it is necessary to comprehend its pluralistic lines of theoretical  tradition. Beginning with the framework of the Birmingham Center for Cultural  Studies in England and its most famous intellectual Stuart Hall, this course  brings together ideas from critical theory, cultural studies, film, and  literature to analyze the development and strategic use of discourses of race,  class, and gender in contemporary society. Bridging the gap between high  culture and street culture, the course offers students a basic,  interdisciplinary \u201ctool kit\u201d with which to read contemporary culture in its  literary, cinematic, and other popular forms.  V51.0244  - The German Intellectual Tradition: Critical Theory - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to German Critical Thought, beginning with its  roots in the 19th century (e.g., Marx and Nietzsche) and following its  trajectory to the Frankfurt School (e.g., Adorno, Benjamin) and beyond (e.g.,  Bakthin, Barthes). Established in 1930 at the Institute for Social Research,  the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a  pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European  social sciences, and continues to exert influence in contemporary social theory  and cultural studies. Often known simply as \u201cCritical Theory,\u201d their key works  cover a vast array of intellectual and political concerns, from the critique of  state capitalism, industrial society, and instrumental reason to commentaries  on mass culture, aesthetics, fashion, fascism, and psychoanalysis. The  interdisciplinary undertakings span many academic subjects and traditions of  economics, sociology, philosophy, literature, art, psychology, pol itics, and  history. In this course, we will begin with an examination of the central precursors to  Critical Theory in the 19thc and will then undertake a broad survey of the  major writings associated with the Frankfurt School as well as those written in  their wake. This introduction to the programmatic statements and eclectic  reflections of various scholars will highlight the diverse historical  influences, collaborative efforts, and internecine debates that shaped the  intellectual tradition across continents and generations. Authors include:  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Marcuse, and others.  V51.0390  - Topics in German Cinema: Creature    Features - Viola Kolarov We will examine some literary, philosophical, religious, and cinematic  contemplations of the creature while focusing on the ways in which the  individual and the mass media metabolize the creaturely in response to trauma.  V51.0999  - Senior Honors Seminar -   Dopico-Black  SPRING 2009  V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media through  an examination of the metropolis as a mirror of our contemporary media  experience. Topics include: the family; literary heritage; technical and occult  media; 20th century genres: thriller, dystopia, sci-fi, crime and drama. An  emphasis will be placed on refining written expression, honing listening and  reading skills, as well as a review of grammar .  V51.0152 - Intro to German Literature - Elke Siegel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of, e.g., hierarchy, love, authority.  V51.0220 - Intro to German Culture - Elke Siegel German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence upon the history  of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the  art movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of  the complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition.  V51.0253 - Topics in German Cinema: Media &amp; Psychoanalysis   - Viola Kolarov This course explores the intersections between psychoanalysis and the media  emerging at the time of its conception, most notably film. Since the course  serves as an introduction to the theory and practice of psychoanalysis we will  examine our daily involvements and investments in both the mass media and  therapeutic practices that rely on our ability to communicate. We will read  texts from the classic Freudian tradition, literary works that inhabit the  psychoanalytic corpus, and watch a number of films from Germany and Hollywood  that tell the story of their -- and our -- development.    V51.0401 - Great Books in German: Twilight of the Idols - Eckart Goebel This seminar, conducted in German, is conceived as a careful, introduction to Friedrich  Nietzsche\u2019s highly influential thinking, and style. The first part will, after  an introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, provide a close reading of the  first book of Day Break (Morgenr\u00f6te), where Nietzsche develops his idea of a  strictly historical philosophy, and confronts us with his theory of culture.  The second part of this seminar will go step by step through Nietzsche\u2019s  attempt to summarize his entire philosophy in The Twilight of the Idols  (G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung). Finally we will read Nietzsche\u2019s essay on Truth and Lying  and conclude with the interpretation of some of his poems, the  Dionysos-Dithyramben. Copies of the German version of G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung may be  purchased at the NYU Bookstore. The other texts will be available in a reader.  Course requirements: Three written reading responses (2 pages each) and one  final paper (5 pages long).   FALL 2008  V51.0297  \u2013 Jews &amp; Germans, an Intercultural History - Paul North The relationship between German and Jewish cultures has historically been much  more complex than the \u201cand\u201d in the title of this course would lead us to  believe. Influence between the \u201ctwo\u201d cultures often flowed in both directions.  For instance, Enlightenment ideas in Germany strongly influenced the Jewish  Enlightenment or Haskala, while philosophers of the Enlightenment\u2014such as  Immanuel Kant\u2014took cues from a Jewish thinker, Moses Mendelssohn. Similarly,  debates over Jewish emancipation in the early nineteenth century corresponded  to a general opening of society that was part of the coalescence of German  national identity. In this course we will explore the complexities of an  affiliation that spoils the conception of culture as single and unified, based  on proprietary treasures deposited in \u201ca\u201d culture. Beginning with the late  eighteenth century we will consider literary, political, theological, and  philosophical texts, along with films, plays, and operas produced up to the eve  of World War II\u2014all of which represent struggles to understand the association  of the two names \u201cGerman\u201d and \u201cJew.\u201d Regarding names, you might also conceive  of this course as an attempt to come to terms with a statement made by Franz  Kafka, a German-speaking Jewish writer living in Prague in the early 20th  century. \u201cI have nothing in common with the Jews,\u201d he wrote, and then added: \u201cI  have nothing in common with Franz Kafka.\u201d Whatever else it might mean, the  statement expresses ambivalence toward unquestioned acceptance of an identity  such as \u201cZionist,\u201d \u201cassimilationist,\u201d \u201canti-Semite,\u201d and so forth. Instead  Kafka asks a more basic question: what does it mean to have \u201csomething in  common with\u201d \u2026 any proper name? This question will help guide our discussions.  The  Devil\u2019s Lectures - Laurence Rickels Vampire Professor Larry Rickels from UCSB (UC Sucks Blood) presents: THE DEVIL in  Ernest Jones, Freud, and Vilem Flusser, among other masters of  the university. Consideration of the syndications of the Devil's reign  in literature and film completes this tempting offering. Sign up of  your own free will.The medley of texts includes excerpts from THE DEVIL'S  ELIXIRS, THE DAMNED, NEEDFUL THINGS, PARADISE LOST, and CHILDHOOD'S END,  among many others. We begin with film clips from SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS  and THE RACE WITH THE DEVIL, rev up with clips from DEMONS and DEMONS 2,  and advance to the slow clip of such Luciferian works as INAUGURATION  OF THE PLEASURE DOME. In between we will also consider -- and exploit!  -- some of the better known Devil films.  Germany  Culture, Politics &amp; Society: Berlin 1900: Lifestyles - Viola Kolarov This course explores the culture, literature and language of Berlin at the turn  of the 20th century. Topics include mores and ethics, inheritance, mental  health, and contemporary tabloid culture. An emphasis will be placed on  refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, and reviewing  grammar and vocabulary.  SPRING 2008  Introduction  to German Literature   - Sladja Blazan This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  German  Intellectual Tradition: Friendship   - Elke Siegel The topic of friendship in recent years has experienced a renaissance.  Disciplines as different as anthropology, literary studies, philosophy, and  sociology have developed a new and invigorated interest in the theory and  practice of friendship as a utopia of a community of individuals differing  radically from those communities based on family or nation. Whereas friendship  was once defined by proximity, similarity, and mutuality, in modern  manifestations and discussions friendship tends towards distance, difference,  and asymmetry (see Derrida\u2019s Politics of Friendship ). The course  explores crucial reflections on friendship in changing contexts and discourses:  Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero), Montaigne\u2019s and Bacon\u2019s friendship essays  of the 17thcentury, the 18th century German \u2018cult of friendship\u2019 (Klopstock,  Schiller), and Romanticism(Tieck); the re-configurations of friendship in  modernity (Nietzsche, Kafka, Bernhard);sociology\u2019s investigation of the friend  as the locus of discretion and tact (Simmel); the notion of friendship as \u201ca  way of life\u201d (Foucault) and as a moral phenomenon (Blum) of particular  importance for feminism (Friedman).  Readings  in Contemporary Theory: Outrageous Texts   - Avital Ronell; Nicola Behrmann M.A. This class will explore over-the-top texts by means of contemporary theoretical  works of Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous and other crucial  writers and philosophers. This much can be said in anticipation: readings will  be slow and intense, at once fabulous and frustrating, because we no longer believe  in wrapping up the meaning of inexhaustible texts or achieving transparency. If  you need subtitles to understand this description, the class will provide them  for you. The texts will be mostly culled from the French, German, and English  canon, ranging from Kleist\u2019s MARQUISE OF O to Kathy Acker\u2019s version of DON  QUIXOTE, and including Werner Herzog\u2019s movie MY BEST FIEND.  FALL 2007  Techniques  of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds.

The course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and  complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as  well as written expression.  Composition  &amp; Conversation: Berlin(s)   -Yevgeniy Pomerantsev This course explores 20th (and 21st) century German culture through a focus on  the city of Berlin and its multiple incarnations as capital (Imperial Reich,  Weimar Republic, Nazi Reich, divided city, GDR and reunified Germany). We will  examine the birth of Germany's first modern metropolis and its subsequent  division and reunification after 1989, focusing also on the post-unification  phenomenon of \"Ostalgie.\" We will work with a variety of written and  visual narratives, including short stories, poetry, film, Feuilleton pieces,  and a novel.  Modern  German Drama - Elke Siegel  V51.0999  Senior Honors Seminar -   Elke Siegel  SPRING 2007       Germany  Culture, Politics and Society: Minority Cultures and Media , - Janelle Blankenship The course explores contemporary German culture, politics, and society, with  special focus on minority cultures and media.

Diverse movements will be  considered, including Expressionism, Soviet Agit-prop, Dada, and Surrealism.  Post  1945 Literature Erinnerungs/Kulturen/Memory Cultures - Christopher Clark This course provides an overview of German literature, film, and culture since  1945, with an emphasis on the topic of memory. German culture after 1945 has been  preoccupied the memory of war, National Socialism, and the Holocaust; debates  among historians are front-page news, particularly the Historikerstreit   of the 1980s and the Goldhagen-Debatte of the 90s. Literature has been  an important vehicle for the process of Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung , or  coming to terms with the past, and we will discuss texts that both thematize  and perform acts of memory. We will examine various strategies of remembering  and memorializing the past, always asking what the significance of memory is  for the present and future. Furthermore, we will examine a range of memory  cultures, considering memories of the 1950s \"economic miracle,\" the  60s student movement and 70s radicalism, and the GDR and its demise, all of  which coexist and compete with memories of the war and the Holocaust in the  same cultural space. We will read texts and view films by such authors and  directors as Anna Seghers, Elisabeth Langg\u00e4sser, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heinrich  B\u00f6ll, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Margarethe von Trotta, Michael Verhoeven,  Benjamin Wilkomirski, W.G. Sebald, Thomas Brussig, Zafer Senocak, Bernhard  Schlink, and other contemporary writers. All readings, discussion, and writing  in German.

It is  a writing-intensive course. This course will explore the literature, film, and  culture of Germany since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the (re-)unification  of East and West Germany in 1990. We will examine a range of aspects of the  culture of contemporary Germany and the \u201cBerlin Republic.\u201d We will work on  refining grammar, vocabulary, and style through frequent writing and revision.  We will work with a variety of written and visual narratives, including short  stories, poetry, newspaper articles, Feuilleton pieces, films, and a  book-length collection of stories.  Conversation  &amp; Composition: Friendship/s   - Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with a solid grasp of  German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of the German  language, history, and culture through reading, discussion and writing.  Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and writing intensive course. In  this course we will explore representations of friendship/s throughout German  culture from the classics (Goethe and Schiller) to today. The theme of  friendship has occupied writers and philosophers throughout history and is a  topic of current discussion in contemporary humanities. You are invited to read  a great variety of textual genres: ballads, poems, aphorisms, short stories, a  children\u2019s novel, and a theater play. Some of the following issues will guide  our investigation: difference between love and friendship, family and friends,  friends and foes; questions of gender [friendship between men and women, male  bonding, girlfriends], proof of friendship; betrayal, loyalty, idealization;  the question of power, and other problems that you may want to bring up.  Literature  and the Senses - Janelle  Blankenship This course explores twentieth-century German literature, as it strains to  hear, see, touch, and dream of new visions of time and space. We will study  fin-de-si\u00e8cle theories of perception, shock, and trauma (Freud, Ernst Mach,  Georg Simmel) and read naturalist novellas, fantasy novels, crime thrillers,  animal epics etc.  German  for Business - Cornelia Uhlenhaut This course is designed for students who have fulfilled their language  requirement and who wish to learn the terminology and conventions of German in  the business world. This is not a class on German economy per se; it rather  introduces students to the use of German language in professional situations,  thus emphasizing communicational and conversational language skills.

German  Poetry: Lyrical poetry from Goethe to Enzensberger - Eckart Goebel   SPRING 2006  German  Culture, Society, and Politics: From Ostzone to Ostalgie - Christopher Clark This course will explore the literature, culture, and politics of the German  Democratic Republic, commonly referred to as \"East Germany.\" From its  beginning as the Soviet-occupied zone to its foundation as a socialist republic  at the dawn of the Cold War, we will trace how artists and intellectuals  negotiated between their own utopian ideals and the often brutal reality of  daily life in a repressive regime. We will examine the Aufbaujahre of  the 1950s and the failed workers' uprising of 1953, as well as the massive flow  of people into the West, leading to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the  most (literally) concrete symbol of the Cold War. We will read the literature  of the relatively liberal early 70s and then explore the disastrous  consequences of the Wolf Biermann affair for artists and intellectuals in the  late 1970s. We will move on to the events leading to the fall of the Wall and  subsequent public debates over re/unification vs. a \"third way.\"  Finally, we will consider the cultural legacy of the GDR in the 1990s and  beyond, including the remainder of the so-called \"Mauer im Kopf\" and  the phenomenon of \"Ostalgie,\" a widespread nostalgia for many aspects  and artifacts of daily life in East Germany. Readings may include literature by  Bertolt Brecht, Stefan Hermlin, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf,  Irmtraud Morgner, Charlotte Worgitzky, Monika Maron, and Thomas Brussig; the  films Coming Out , Sonnenallee , and Good Bye Lenin! ; and a  range of short historical and non-fiction texts.

Introduction  to German Literature   - Martin Sch\u00e4fer This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres - poetry, prose, drama - some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  Marx,  Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, three German  authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically new  understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the  origin of much modern thinking.  Early  German Cinema: Science/Sensation/Spectacle   - Janelle Blankenship This course will focus on the sensational origins of cinema in Germany.   We will examine cinema as part of a wider exhibition culture that includes  phantasmagoria ghost projection, magic lanterns, and the  \"edutainement\" of microscopes, X-rays and stereoscopes. Our analysis  of German cinema starts with the body madness of the \"Boxing  Kangaroo\" (from Max and Emil Skladanowsky's 1895 Wintergarten film  program) and ends with colonial cinema (Im deutschen Sudan) and German horror  classics ( Caligari, Genuine, Nosferatu! ). Rare glimpses into the  Skladanowsky retrospective of the Third Reich and a screening of New German  cinema representations of forgotten film pioneers also illuminate the act of  creating a national film history and archive .  Great  Books in German Literature: Technology, Tricks, and the Supernatural - Janelle Blankenship This course considers uncanny moments of magical tricks, technology, and the  supernatural in German literature and film. Diverse historical periods, genres,  and aesthetic styles will be analyzed by way of attention to the overarching  theme of this seminar.

Particular emphasis is placed on the development of complex  reading and writing skills and their integration with speaking skills. All  courses at this level are conducted in German. All German courses at the 100  level require successful completion of GERM-UA 4 or GERM-UA 20, or permission  of the department.

Study  of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a  focus on form, genre, and narrativity.          Advanced  Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level)      These courses examine authors, groups of works, and  intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the  development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower  focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination  rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding  than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and  the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German.          Goethe    GERM-UA  455 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Examines  Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose,  poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to  classicism and beyond.          The  Age of Goethe    GERM-UA  456 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Examines  German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and  of classicism. Considers irrationalism, social protest, and Humanit\u00e4tsdichtung as successive  stages of the expansion of consciousness in an age in which Goethe was the  central, but not the only significant, literary figure.

Johann Fausten ;  Goethe's Urfaust and excerpts from  his later dramatic versions ( Faust , Ein Fragment ; Faust I and II ); and Thomas  Mann's Doktor  Faustus .          Literature  of the Weimar Period    GERM-UA  468 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    The  chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with revolution and ended with the Nazi  takeover. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism  to the aesthetics of \"new sobriety\" ( Neue Sachlichkeit ). From the more  traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary  (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period problematize its  subsequent glorification as the golden \u00a1\u00a520s. Readings include works by Brecht,  Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.          Minority  Discourses    GERM-UA  475 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    In  recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of  \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by  so-called foreigners. Critical analysis of this notion and of the impact of  individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism,  integration, and national identity.          Seminar  on 19th-Century Authors    GERM-UA  487 Offered  periodically. 4 points.          Seminar  on 20th-Century Authors    GERM-UA  488 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Each  of these seminars provides advanced students of German with an in-depth  knowledge of one major author of either the 19th or 20th century. Works by the  chosen author are examined in terms of how he or she contributes to, and  possibly challenges, prevailing aesthetic, political, and cultural trends of  his or her time.

Conversation and Composition is a   reading, writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed   on refining written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the   ability to articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and   argue points of view; developing analytic and interpretive writing   skills; and encouraging flexibility of expression. In addition, a   thorough grammar review will be part of our work. During the course of   the semester we will explore the fascination with ghosts, ghostly   apparitions, scenes of dread, and haunted or scientifically inexplicable   events from the 1800s to today\u2014in particular, with the enduring   association of new technologies and electronic media with paranormal or   spiritual phenomena from a media or science and technologies studies   perspective. GERM-UA132 M, W 12:30 \u2013 1:45 Germany in Contemporary Cinema Alys George This post-intermediate course investigates how contemporary German cinema  has thematized recent German history. How have filmmakers approached topics  such as the resistance movements of World War II, postwar family life, East German  surveillance, the fall of the Berlin Wall, Jewish identity, social inequality  and injustice, the immigrant experience, and European unity? Directors\u2019  approaches to depicting 20th- and 21st-century Germany  history are diverse, surprising, deeply personal, and often humorous. You will  improve your language proficiency in speaking, writing, and listening, while  increasing your knowledge of German film, German history and culture, and film  techniques in general. Films by leading German directors will include Das  Leben der Anderen (2006), Berlin is in Germany (2001), Die  fetten Jahre sind vorbei (2004), Rosenstra\u00dfe (2003), Im  Juli (2000), and Das Wunder von Bern (2003). GERM-UA220 M, W 11:00 \u2013 12:15 Introduction to German Culture &amp; Thought: Luther to Nietzsche Christiane Frey How   is it that Martin Luther, the firebrand initiator of the Protestant   Reformation, could call for a liberation from the dogmatism of the   church and yet maintain that all men should obey secular authority? Why   do we generally hold that the philosopher and scientist G.W. Leibniz   stood at the beginning of modernity (and what, by the way, is   \u201cmodernity\u201d supposed to be?) despite the fact that he wrote a massive   volume on how to defend the existence of God? Is the Enlightenment   tolerant? Did Hegel really believe that the modern state should be   Christian? Could it be true that one can tell lies in an extra-moral   sense, to disfigure a title from Nietzsche? And last but not least: to   what use (or abuse) should one look into (intellectual) history? This   course will address these and other questions by exploring the history   of German thought and culture from the 16th to the 19th century.   Discussion will focus \u2013 at times perhaps in unconventional ways and   through the lens of modern theory \u2013 on some of the most prominent texts   of the canon of philosophy, theology, the sciences, and, of course,   literature. Beyond the authors mentioned, readings will also include   texts by Paracelsus, Johannes Kepler, Kant, Goethe, Kleist, and Rahel   Varnhagen. GERM-UA240 T, R 3:30 \u2013 4:45 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,   three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways   provided radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the   psyche. Writing from the mid-19th century through the 1930s, the three   thinkers placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions   of the state, the subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this   course is to provide a comprehensive engagement with the writings of   Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by bringing them into dialogue with each   other. That is, rather than reading the three authors chronologically,   the course is organized around six topoi \u2013 interpretation, history,   subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a paradigmatic text   from each author is read. The seminar underscores their prevailing   actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern   thinking. GERM-UA349 T, R 11:00 \u2013 12:15 German Romanticism: Speculative Technologies: The Literature of German Romanticism Leif Weatherby This   course introduces students to German Romanticism, a movement that   grasped itself as a literary, philosophical and scientific watershed in   human history. Rather than following the traditional division between   early, high, and late Romanticism, we will track three figures in   Romanticism\u2019s multifaceted corpus: reflexivity, depth, and the social.   We will start with the emergence of the movement in Jena and its roots   in biological and philosophical discourses, where reflexivity plays a   crucial role in the fragmentary and novelistic writings of Friedrich and   August Wilhelm Schlegel, as well as Novalis and Ludwig Tieck. The   troubling figure of \u201cdepth\u201d will make up the second unit of inquiry, in   such figures as Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich Creuzer, and   Clemens Brentano. Deploying both of these techniques, Heinrich von   Kleist, E. T. A. Hoffmann and Heinrich Heine bring Romantic techniques   to bear on the changing fabric of the social, revealing Romanticism as a   technically concrete and simultaneously speculative response to the   increasingly complexity of modern life. GERM-UA283 (HBRJD-UA685 ) T, R 3:30-4:45 The Holocaust: The Third Reich and the Jews David Engel This   lecture course is an historical investigation of the evolution of Nazi   policies toward Jews; of Jewish behavior in the face of those policies;   and of the attitudes of other countries, both within and outside the   Nazi orbit, for the situation of Jews under the rule of the Third Reich.   GERM-UA999 T 9:30 - 12:30 Senior Honors Seminar Ara Merjian GERM-UA501 TBD Honors Thesis Alys George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2014  GERM-UA133 -  German  Culture 1890 \u2013 1989: Nationalism,  Industrialization, and War: Germany, 1890-1945  - Chadwick Smith This course examines the interaction between German literature and other  social institutions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will  investigateGerman responses to rapidly changing technological, economic, and  material conditions following the failed revolutions and continuing through  German unification and industrialization, and culminating in the First World  War. We will also consider how literature and theoretical writing provide a  site inwhich to imagine social change, as we examine a variety of conflicts  between traditional social norms and new conceptions of self and society, and  trace the evolution of conceptions of social class, gender and identity and the  anxiety such developments inspired. Readings will include selections from:  Benjamin, Brecht, Fontane, Freud, Musil, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Simmel.  GERM-UA152 -  Intro to German Literature  - Leif Weatherby Required for the German major. Introduces  students to representative authors and works of German literature, with  emphasis on the modern period. Students learn basic conventions of literature  and literary interpretation, as well as strategies for the effective reading of  shorter and longer prose works, drama, and poetry. Guided writing assignments  focus on developing the language skills necessary for effective written  analysis and interpretation of literary texts in German.  GERM-UA244 - German  Intellectual Tradition: The Myth of the Machine. From Divine Automata  to the Internet - Leif Weatherby We live in a world of technological mediation. Devices provide us with the  rules--for geographical orientation, fordating, for knowing the weather. Do we  use our devices, or do they use us? The question is old, and this course looks  at cultures of machines from the Early Modern period to the present. It will  proceed thematically, treating problems in historical technological cultures  like computers (Pascal, Babbage, Kittler), automata (Vaucanson, Hoffmann,  Helmholtz, Merimee, \u010capek), divine machines (Leibniz, Jean Paul, Wiener,  G\u00fcnther), the advent of film (M\u00fcnsterberg, Lang, Benjamin), animals/humans and  \"the tool\" (Geroi-Lourhan, Heidegger, Darwin/Marx, Engels, Kapp,  Samuel Butler) and the so-called \"megamachine\" of modern society  (J\u00fcnger, Mumford). The framework will be the negative anthropology tradition  between Herder and Gehlen and the reversal of the myth from the extension of  human powers to the primacy of the technological. The shared conviction of  nearly all these authors is that culture must reflect on its machines--and on  itself as a machine-like entity--in order to survive .  GERM-UA249 -  Intro to Theory : Critical Theory from Plato to  Adorno and Beyond  - Alan Itkin With Plato\u2019s Republic , critical theory begins with a bang: Plato  bans poets from his ideal republic, telling us that they are nothing but liars  corrupting those who read their works. Poetry, Plato writes, is misleading  because it is nothing but a copy of a copy, an imitation of the mere appearance  of reality. The two questions Plato links together\u2014what is literature, and what  is it good for?\u2014have been at the center of critical theory ever since, and the  answers theorists give to the one are almost always implicitly answers to the  other as well. In this course we will trace these questions from the classical  period to the present with the help of theorists including Plato, Aristotle,  Nietzsche, Marx, Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Zizek. We will  examine and develop the principles and methods we use to analyze and interpret  literature and the other arts, because there can be no interpretation without  theoretical assumptions. As another critical theorist, Paul de Man, has told  us, the resistance to theory is itself a form of theory.  GERM-UA487 -  Seminar on 19th Century Literature: Staging  Revolt in German Drama  - Chadwick Smith This course examines German drama from the late 18th and early 19th centuries,  when discourses of rights and the equal application of law supplant other  ethical and political discourses, a shift that requires a revised relationship  between the individual human subject and the state. Giving a political role to  aesthetics, the stage becomes the public venue in which these reconfigurations  are played out. The focus is on the partisans\u2014on G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, Karl  Moor, Hermann, and Danton. An analysis of these figures allows for a  delineation of the borders of state violence. These works raise questions the  contours of sovereignty. What rights do citizens have over and above those  granted by the State? What right to revolt? What power do those outside of the  political order wield? How do states attempt to contain dissent or brand it  terror? These questions will structure the course and identify parallels to the  contemporary world.  FALL 2013 GERM-UA153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation.      Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will  be distributed by the instructor. Materials may include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate one or more longer prose texts (TBD) from German to English as a  class. This work will accompany our course throughout the semester. GERM-UA111 - Conversation/Composition: Taking Sides in  Berlin - A Century of Debates in and about a Divided City -  Chadwick Smith  The course follows Berlin\u2019s course through the  tumultuous 20th century, in which Berlin can rightfully be said to have played  the central, starring role. By attending to a series of representative and  debates and divisions that came to define the century, we will tour a city  riven by the forces of industrialization and rapid growth, torn asunder by war,  physically divided in two during the cold war, and finally reunified to emerge  as a multicultural world capital. When possible, we will trace the historical public and private divisions  forward to the forms they take in contemporary Berlin, a magnet for an  international creative class and setting for very contemporary debates over  memorialization, race and ethnicity, and art. Toward this goal, we will engage  with and comment upon them through the lens of news and entertainment media.  We will work with a variety of written (short  stories, poetry, newspaper articles, feuilleton , and a novel) and visual  sources including film, visual art, and architecture and design. At the same  time, we will learn to write in various genres such as the news report,  commentary or feuilleton , and film or book review. Toward these goals, we will also  address the development of the various media\u2019s role in society, and the way in  which changing media technologies affect interaction with culture and language.   Conversation and Composition is designed for  students with a solid grasp on German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of German language, history, politics, and culture, through  reading, discussion, and writing. All readings, discussion, and written work  for the course will be in German. We will work on refining written and spoken  expression with particular focus on the ability to articulate opinions,  exchange substantive information, and argue points of view; developing analytic  and interpretive writing skills; and expanding students\u2019 linguistic toolkit. A  thorough grammar review will thus necessarily be part of our work.  GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition:  Literature, the Sciences &amp; Philosophy: Kepler to Kleist - Christiane  Frey  How did the  sciences, philosophy, and literature interact and influence one another on the  way to becoming the discrete pursuits they are today? This course will approach  this question by tracing a series of entanglements that challenge our sense of  what knowledge is. We will explore, for example, why Kepler wrote a dream  narrative to promote his scientific discoveries; how Leibniz\u2019s philosophy was  shaped by the microscope and romances; how the modern novel aligns with  statistics. We will retrace the birth of a new science called \u201caesthetics,\u201d  investigate how Goethe\u2019s affinity to chemistry changed his way of writing, and  discuss how the romantic concept of science might question our idea of the  humanities and the sciences as \u201ctwo cultures.\u201d Finally, we will ask how all  these \u201ccases\u201d are connected and what they tell us about the distinctions we  rely on to produce knowledge.   GERM-UA366 -  20th Century Prose: Women\u2019s Voices from Germany and Austria - Alys George  This course introduces you to prose works by a selection  of the most influential 20th-century women writers from Germany and Austria  (among them Lou Andreas-Salom\u00e9, Anna Seghers, Ingeborg Bachmann, Christa Wolf,  and the Nobel Prize-winners Elfriede Jelinek and Herta M\u00fcller). We consider  what constitutes Frauenliteratur, \u201cwomen\u2019s writing,\u201d but also think through  major historical topics of the past century as represented in literary texts by  female authors. These include: the role of women at the fin de si\u00e8cle; the New  Woman in the Weimar Republic; life under National Socialism; women\u2019s roles in  post-WWII reconstruction; gender roles in the Communist bloc; the women\u2019s  liberation movement; immigrant and minority discourses; and the status of  gender and sexuality as reflected by contemporary media. Genres covered will  include autobiography, short story, novella, and novel.   GERM-UA283 - Topics: The Portrait -  Christopher Wood A portrait is a depiction or description of a real individual. Portraiture  faces a series of conceptual challenges: how much information is necessary to  secure reference to the portrayed person? how is the effect of likeness  achieved? what is, in the end, \u201cindividual\u201d about a human being? All cultures  in all times have produced portraits. Portraiture reveals how a culture thinks  about persons, selves, and souls. Some portraits are also works of art; how  does this change the game? The seminar will approach a wide range of examples,  pictorial and textual, from a variety of perspectives. Topics will include:  portraits of holy men and women (icons); tomb portraits; portrait photography;  portraits and the state (royal effigies, defamatory portraits, ID cards);  verbal portraits; the portrait as a theme in fiction; biography and  autobiography; portraits and the performance of self; studio models.   GERM-UA999 \u2013  Senior Honors Seminar - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby   GERM-UA501 \u2013  Honors Thesis - Alys  George &amp; Leif Weatherby  SPRING 2013  GERM-UA152 - Introduction to Literature - Arne Hoecker   This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to  a selection of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written  in German language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close  and critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. All  readings in German.  GERM-UA185 - Introduction to German Poetry: Das Ich und  das Ding - Leif Weatherby  This course introduces the long tradition of German lyric  poetry. Lyric is usually associated with the sentimental and experiential  subject, longing for the completeness of nature or the embrace of a lover. The  lyric subject, however, is constantly confronted by a world of things, and  these things are inflected by the gender of the poet. From the thing-like  nature of the beloved in niedere (but also ebene ) Minne in  the medieval tradition to the \u201cthing-poems\u201d of Rainer Maria Rilke to the  eviscerated and partial objects of Paul Celan, lyric reveals itself as the  genre of the (gendered) subject in a world of objects. We will read poems from  one female and one male poet in five periods: Medieval (Hildegard von Bingen,  Walter von der Vogelweide); Early Modern (Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg,  Andreas Gryphius); Romanticism (Karoline von der G\u00fcnderrode, Friedrich  H\u00f6lderlin); Modernism (Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, Rainer Maria Rilke); and post-WWII  (Ingeborg Bachmann; Paul Celan). Throughout the German lyric corpus, we will  ask ourselves, what is an \u201cI\u201d? To whom and to what gender does this \u201cI\u201d belong?  And how is it mediated by the thing-world? All readings in German. GERM-UA240 -  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Arne Hoecker This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically  new understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin  of much modern thinking.  GERM-UA347 -  German Enlightenment: Vernunft und Schrecken - Leif Weatherby The German \u201cEnlightenment\u201d was and is a controversial hybrid.  The growth of communications technologies across Europe put the fragmented  German-speaking lands into self-perceived cultural, scientific, and  philosophical competition and dialogue with other European nations. In  literature, poets from Albrecht von Haller to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing to  Johann Wolfgang von Goethe struggled to establish a \u201cGerman\u201d paradigm to match  the philosophical and poetic cultures in France, England, and Scotland. From  the start, they maintained the combination of literature, philosophy, and  science, often mixing these apparently distinct spheres for the purposes of  fostering a unified \u201cnation.\u201d This course looks at Enlightenment as a  cross-disciplinary attempt to fashion a culture of \u201creason,\u201d and asks a  question: how does reason deal with its weightiest uncanny counterpart, terror?  Starting with Newton and Leibniz, we will read the philosophical-aesthetic  debates of the 1740s (Bodmer, Gottsched, von Haller), the attempt at  Germanification of tragedy as a philosophical form of literature in the 1750s  (Lessing, Mendelssohn, Nicolai), and the late but leading Enlightener Immanuel  Kant and his natural-scientific counterpart, Johann Blumenbach. We will also  discuss such reactions to \u201cEnlightenment\u201d as Wieland\u2019s \u201csensibility\u201d ( Empfindsamkeit )  movement, the Storm and Stress ( Sturm und Drang) , Lavater\u2019s Physiognomie ,  and Winckelmann's as well as Goethe's and Schiller\u2019s classicism. Throughout, we  will see how the emergent hybrid \u201creason\u201d confronts political and aesthetic  (and even natural-scientific) terrors, and how it\u2014perhaps\u2014produces some of its  own. All readings in German .  GERM-UA283 (This course originates in History-  cross-listed as HIST-UA 283 ) - The Origin of Humanity: History of a  Modern Obsession - Stefanos Geroulanos In its attempt to reexamine and reinterpret the sources and  consequences of human knowledge, the Enlightenment irrevocably displaced the  widely accepted biblical explanation of the origin of man, his creation in the  image and resemblance of God. With this displacement was born, or reborn, a largely  new set of questions: Where does man come from? What was early humanity like?  How has mankind changed or progressed since those early times? How long ago  were those early times? Did culture proper emerge in Greece? In India? At a  historical fount of races and nations? In \u201cprimitive\u201d culture? Which origin  should be taken most seriously\u2014that of the human species, or that of modern  culture? Were the \u201cearly times\u201d a kind of utopia that needs to be recaptured?  And given change and progress, where is mankind today, and where is it going?  What would be the effect of seeking to reconstitute, to bring about, a society  based on this origin? These questions, and the history of the answers offered to  them, will be at the heart of our course. At its most general level, the course  is an introduction and overview of major themes in modern European intellectual  history, focusing on the modern obsession with re-divining and often re-living the  origins of man. We will be concerned with both philosophical texts and  scientific efforts to identify and clarify this origin, with the political  implications of such origins, and not least with efforts to identify who (which  discipline? which political party?) should have authority for determining and  using \u201cthe origin.\u201d We will read some of the crucial texts in the period from  the 1750s to the 1960s, tracing the answers offered by philosophers,  anthropologists, biologists, linguists, and poets. FALL 2012 GERM-UA455 - Goethe - Arne H\u00f6cker This course offers insight into one of the big shots of  German literature: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) is the icon of the  bourgeois artist and universal genius, an Enlightenment philosopher, a  researcher of nature, a poet, and a minister in the state of Weimar. This  course will examine Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. We will  read and discuss Goethe\u2019s prose, poetry, and dramatic work from the late  Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond. In addition,  we will acquaint ourselves with Goethe\u2019s autobiographic and scientific  writings. GERM-UA145 - Viennese Modernism: Love, Madness, Death   - Alys George This course offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the  culture of turn-of-the-century Vienna, one of the birthplaces of  twentieth-century modernism. The works of Austrian writers, artists,  architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the  political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from  a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama),  film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of  this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by  and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include  Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold  Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl.  This course is a 100-level, post-intermediate course in German, which will also  focus on language acquisition at the advanced level. A portion of the course  will involve visits to museums in New York. GERM-UA111 - Conversation and Composition: Von Geistern,  Gespenstern und anderen merkw\u00fcrdigen Gestalten/Of ghosts and other curious  creatures (taught in German) - Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with  a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their  knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as  a thorough review of grammar. This course explores the fascination with ghosts, ghostly  apparitions, and haunted scenes in the arts from the 1800s to today in a  variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, maybe opera,  paintings/photos, music, popular culture, etc. Authors will include Johann  Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich von Kleist, Johann Peter Hebel, E.T.A. Hoffmann,  Theodor Storm, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Franz Kafka, Thomas Mann, Marie-Luise  Kaschnitz, Yoko Tawada, Inka Parei, among others. The question why we are fascinated  by the scientifically inexplicable and how it was treated in the arts to this  day will accompany us throughout the semester. Please don\u2019t be scared. GERM-UA244 - German Intellectual Tradition: Do the  Revolution: German Culture and Revolutionary Violence - Leif Weatherby Germany has never had a successful revolution. Its culture,  however, has been obsessed with violence and systemic political change from  Luther to the violent leftist groups of the Federal Republic. The external and  passive revolutions that dissolved the feudal system in Germany led the poet  H\u00f6lderlin to call the Germans \u201cthought-rich and deed-poor.\u201d This course will  make a positive of what Marx called the \u201cGerman Ideology,\u201d focusing on the  productive anxieties of a figure of fascination: revolutionary violence.  Starting with Luther\u2019s rejection of the Peasants\u2019 War, we will consider the  French Revolution among the Romantics, the revolutions of 1848 among the Young  Hegelians and Marx, the Russian revolutions among the Expressionists, violence  and art in and around National Socialism, and the anti-capitalist violence of  the RAF and the Baader-Meinhof Group, among others. We will finish the course  with theoretical considerations of the meaning of revolution in contemporary  geopolitics. Authors include: Luther, Hegel, Kleist, Marx, Luxemburg, Toller,  J\u00fcnger, Fassbinder, and Zizek.  SPRING  2012   GERM-UA.133  - German Culture 1890 - 1989: German/Jewish: Negotiating Identity in Post-1945  Literature &amp; Culture -   Alys George This course explores how authors of Jewish heritage in Germany and  Austria have probed the boundaries of identity after 1945. By introducing  students to a range of critical questions and forms of cultural production, the  course aims is to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of  German-Jewish and Austrian-Jewish experience and their contemporary  representations. Central questions will include: can \u201cJewishness,\u201d \u201cGermanness,\u201d or  \u201cAustrianness\u201d be defined? What constitutes \u201cJewish writing\u201d? How are Jewish  identity, experience, and culture \u201ctranslated\u201d into literature and film? How do  Jewish authors perceive their role in contemporary German and Austrian society  and public discourse? What role do the remembrance of the past (in particular,  of the Shoah), the politics of the present, and day-to-day minority experiences  play in public/political discourse and cultural production?  This  questioning is set against the background of the exclusions and atrocities that  shaped German and Austrian society and their relation to those deemed \u2018other\u2019  in the twentieth century. The course will cover topics such as autobiography and exile, language and  gender, memory and \u201cpostmemory\u201d in the cultural production of writers of Jewish  heritage in the German language. Written and visual texts by first-generation  survivors such as Paul Celan, Nelly Sachs, Ilse Aichinger, Edgar Hilsenrath,  and Ruth Kl\u00fcger, as well as by second-generation writers like Barbara  Honigmann, Doron Rabinovici, Maxim Biller, and Esther Dischereit form the core  of the course. These texts will be discussed in connection with theoretical  approaches. Genres will include poetry, drama, autobiography and memoir, short  stories, non-fiction, the novel, and film.  GERM-UA.152  \u2013 Introduction to German Literature   -Arne Hoecker This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection  of representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  GERM-UA244  \u2013 German Intellectual Tradition: The Failure of Human Dignity - Chadwick Smith During the long 19th century, literature and philosophy informed the  Enlightenment project of human freedom and emancipation while simultaneously  staging its failure. Starting with Hannah Arendt\u2019s The Origins of  Totalitarianism (1951) and taking the notion of the \u201cperplexities\u201d of modern  human rights as a guiding framework, we will read canonical 19th-century German  literary texts from Goethe to Kafka and place them into dialog with theoretical  and philosophical reflections from the 19th and 20th centuries (Hegel, Marx,  Ranciere, Agamben) in order to explore the problems inherent both within human  rights and in defining the category of the human itself.  GERM-UA.397  \u2013 Topics in 19th Century Literature: Literature and Criminality - Arne Hoecker This course will focus on 19th century German literature by examining the  various intersections between cultural, social and scientific discourse. We  will study literary representations of crime from Romanticism to Realism and  Naturalism, looking at questions of form, genre, and narrativity. In addition,  we will confront these literary representations with judicial and psychological  definitions of criminality, and study their interrelation at the level of  narrative strategies invoked in the portrayal of the criminal.  FALL  2011       GERM-UA.0111  - Conversation and Composition \u2013 Berlin: Metropolis &amp; Metamorphosis - Alys George  Conversation and Composition is designed for post-intermediate students  of German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to  expand on their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through  reading, discussion, and writing. Conversation and Composition is a reading,  writing, and speaking intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining  written and spoken expression, with particular focus on the ability to  articulate opinions, exchange substantive information, and argue points of  view; developing analytic and interpretive writing skills; and encouraging  flexibility of expression. In addition, a thorough grammar review will be part  of our work. If  Walter Benjamin called Paris the capital of the nineteenth century, Berlin was  in many ways the capital of the twentieth century. The city became a stage for  remarkable shifts and ruptures that occurred between 1900 and 2000, and this  course explores a century of radical cultural, historical, and political  change. Berlin was, by turns, imperial capital; hothouse for the Weimar  Republic\u2019s avant-garde impulses; National Socialism\u2019s imagined \u201cGermania\u201d;  post-World War II divided city; Cold War capital of the GDR; and, today,  capital of a reunified Germany.  We  will take a cultural studies approach to twentieth-century Berlin and learn how  to effectively \u201cread\u201d and interpret textual and visual materials. This course  is designed to be interdisciplinary, so we will work with a variety of written  genres (poetry, short stories, novel, journalistic non-fiction), visual art,  architecture, and film. Authors will include Walter Benjamin, Alfred D\u00f6blin,  Inge Deutschkron, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf, Peter Schneider, Katja  Lange-M\u00fcller, Durs Gr\u00fcnbein, Monika Maron, Zafer Senocak, and Wladimir Kaminer.  Film materials will include Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Gro\u00dfstadt [1927], Berlin  Alexanderplatz , Die M\u00f6rder sind unter uns , Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin ,   Sonnenallee , Berlin: Sinfonie einer Gro\u00dfstadt [2002], and Das  Leben der Anderen .  GERM-UA.0153  - Techniques of Translation   - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students  will encounter diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic  problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The  course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic  structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as well as written  expression. A background reader in English will familiarize students with  historical and theoretical implications of translation. Photocopies  of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be distributed  by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine articles; recipes;  TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical articles; pop  material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts: prose,  theater, poetry, libretti, among others. In addition to those weekly  translation assignments, which will be critically assessed in class, we will  translate a longer prose text (TBD) from German to English as a class. This  work will accompany our course throughout the semester.  GERM-UA.0244  - The Age of angst : German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1939 - Alys George  This course explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and  anxiety that pervaded German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and  early twentieth centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of  war, rapid industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the  political and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the  very bedrock upon which society had been built. The intellectual and aesthetic  responses to this pervasive sense of angst and upheaval, as well as the  challenges and changes themselves, form the focus of this course. We will  reflect in depth on how the intellectual impulses informed aesthetic innovation  as we explore the meaning and nature of modernity and crisis in early  twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will include Nietzsche, Freud,  Loos, Simmel, Weber, Benjamin, Heidegger, and Kracauer.  GERM-UA.0366  - 20th Century Prose: Miniatures of Modernity from Nietzsche to Benjamin - Arne H\u00f6cker German and Austrian writers from the turn of the century to the Weimar  Republic experimented with genres of short prose as a privileged literary form  to express philosophical thought and cultural criticism. Through close readings  of German short prose pieces from Nietzsche\u2019s aphorisms to Kafka\u2019s parables,  and Benjamin\u2019s thought-images ( Denkbilder ), this course explores the  thresholds between image and text, intuition and reflection, literature and  philosophy. Other modernist authors to be read include Hofmannsthal, Robert  Walser, D\u00f6blin, Benn, Musil, and Broch.  SPRING  2011       V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We will  focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar.  V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature   - Paul Buchholz This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  V51.0240 \u2013 Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud,  three German-language authors who in different and decisive ways provided  radically new understandings of economics, philosophy, and the psyche. Writing  from the mid-19 th century through the 1930s, the three thinkers  placed their indelible stamps on reformulating modern notions of the state, the  subject, knowledge, and the mind. The purpose of this course is to provide a  comprehensive engagement with the writings of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud by  bringing them into dialogue with each other. That is, rather than reading the  three authors chronologically, the course is organized around six topoi \u2013  interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art \u2013 in which a  paradigmatic text from each author is read. The seminar underscores their  prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the origin of much modern  thinking.  V51.0253 \u2013 Topics in German Cinema: Faust and Film - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the theoretical responses to J. W. Goethe's  \"Faust I and II\" and the philosophy of tragedy. We will examine a  large body of cinematic work that re-releases the component parts of Goethe's  literary experiment. The course serves as an introduction to German studies,  media studies, and psychoanalysis. In English.  V51.0488  \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Ingeborg Bachmann - Paul Buchholz The Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann (1926-1973) composed a striking array of  provocative writing across a variety of literary genres. Her work voices  a deep discomfort the conventional operations of language, but also continually  revisits the hope that writing can bring about changes in the world. From  her early poetry and stories to her later work on the uncompleted \u201cTodesarten\u201d  novel-cycle, Bachmann offers reflections on a vast array of interwoven  concerns: remembrance of and opposition to war, the nature of time and  historical experience, the making of feminine the voice, economic inequality  and the persistence of fascist structures within the family, the limits and  possibilities of the individual voice. Moreover, Bachmann's multi-voiced  writing engages in an intense dialogue with major 20th century philosophers of  history and time (Walter Benjamin and Martin Heidegger). We will begin  with a study of Bachmann's poetry before moving on to radio plays, short  stories, lectures on poetics, and one uncompleted novel.  FALL 2010       V51.0111  - Conversation and Composition: Tatorte/Crime Scenes- Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for post Intermediate students of  German with a solid grasp of German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend  their knowledge of the German language, history, and culture through reading,  discussion, and writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and  writing intensive course. Emphasis will be placed on refining written  expression and developing the ability to express, discuss, and argue opinions.  In addition, a thorough review of grammar will be part of our work. This  course explores narratives about crimes and crime scenes from the 1800s to  today in a variety of genres: narrative prose, poetry, theater, film, TV  series, paintings/photos, among others. Authors will include E.T.A.  Hoffmann, Franz Kafka, Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, Bertolt Brecht, Andrea Maria  Schenkel, Feuerbach and others. Questions of guilt, social and historical  underpinnings of crime stories, motives for crime, and the fascination with  solving riddles will accompany us throughout the semester.  While  engaging in the topic of crimes, we will work on writing and speaking skills  and hopefully also write our own crime or detective story. So don\u2019t be scared.  V51.0132  \u2013 German Culture, Politics &amp; Society   - Paul Buchholz Spectres of 1968: Afterlives of Political and Social Revolt In German culture, the year 1968 continues to haunt, irritate and inspire as a  time when society was supposed to change, suddenly and utterly. The  utopian and anti-war student movements of 1960s West Germany emerged amongst a  wide array of \"alternative\" ideas of political action, cultural  expression, historical remembering and communal living.  To explore the diversity of these ideas, we will embark on close and thoughtful  readings of a variety of written and visual materials, including films,  political essays, newspaper articles, songs, poetry, ethnography, one short  novel and a theatre piece. Authors will include Hans Magnus Enzensberger,  Ingeborg Bachmann, Peter Weiss, Peter Schneider, the activist Rudi Dutschke,  and Peter Handke. Our explorations will carry us through the 1970s and  80s, into the present, with study of the alternative communities in the  Kreuzberg neighborhood in Berlin, and recent mainstream \"political\"  films that look back to the \"lost chances\" in German cultural history. In parallel to our readings, we will work to refine analytic and interpretive  writing in German through regular written assignments and a final paper.   This course is designed for students with a solid grasp of basic German  grammar and vocabulary, and will expand flexibility of expression in  German through ongoing and creative dialogue with the many voices that speak  about, and from within, a time of \"revolt.\" V51.0220 \u2013 Intro to German Thought &amp; Culture - Elke Siegel German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence upon the history  of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the art  movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of the  complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition. V51.0298 \u2013 Topics in 20th Century Lit: Playing &amp; Reality: Hamlet  in German Letters - Viola Kolarov The course offers an overview of the German reception of Shakespeare's  \"Hamlet\" with an emphasis on its impact on 20th century thought. We  will consider general theoretical questions of translation in the German  context, the psychoanalytic paradigm of transference, ghostly transmission,  film and media responses, and common grounds between the German and  Anglo-American traditions. The course will serve as introduction to German  thought, comparative methods, psychoanalysis, and media analysis.  V51.0488 \u2013 Rilke\u2019s Lyrical Poetry - Eckart Goebel  This class is conceived to provide an introduction to the universe of Rilke\u2019s  Lyrical Poetry. By means of measured and careful close readings we will follow  the trajectory of Rilke\u2019s oeuvre, from the early poems to the late Duino  Elegies. Since Rilke excelled in many different forms and meters, this seminar  also serves as an introduction to \u201cVerslehre,\u201d including the study of random  phenomena like the prose poem. A special emphasis will be put on Rilke\u2019s theory  of \u201cthings\u201d as well on his art of description.  V51.0999  \u2013 Senior Honors Seminar   - Paul Fleming  SPRING 2010       V51.0152  - Introduction to German Literature - Eckart  Goebel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others. V51.0133 - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola  Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media. We  will focus on the metropolis as allegory of modern experience. Topics include  literary heritage, architecture, philosophy, and major 20th century genres:  autobiography, utopia/dystopia, sci-fi, and crime drama. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, as  well as a review of grammar. V51.0253 - German Cinema: Crypto-fetishism and the Postwar Film - Viola  Kolarov We will focus on the psychoanalytic definition and evolution of the concept of  the fetish by examining the psychological effects of war on filmmaking in  Germany and beyond. As a product of trauma the techno-fetish contains a record  of failed mourning and a blueprint of group formation. We will base our  readings and discussion of psychoanalytic, philosophical, and literary texts on  postwar film made in the Federal Republic and Hollywood. V51.0216 - Scoring Literature: The Drug Culture - Avital Ronell This course is taught in English and originates in the Comparative Literature  Department and is crosslisted with the German Department. As a way to get  access to some of the most vital aspects of comparative literature and German  as fields, this course will explore the role of addiction, pharmacology,  intoxication, and poison in fiction, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Our  readings will take us to places where the motifs linked to drug cultures are  often concealed or repressed. During the course of the semester we will take a  close look at the pharmacodependency with which literature has been associated  historically--as sedative, as cure, as escape conduit or euphorizing substance,  as mimetic poisoning. In the cases of Baudelaire, Flaubert and James Joyce the  literary text was legally treated as a drug and run off the market by outraged  judges. We will analyze the legal documents that first declared these literary  works illicit, and then turned around those decisions. Some  of the questions that will be raised in class discussion include: What is the  relation of literature to law? How does the literary work become a medical  problem? Why has fiction been identified as part of a self-destructive drive?  What are the rhetorical strategies that render the poetic word, since the time  of Plato, socially inadmissible? We will read the relevant stimulants and works  of Kant, Heidegger, Derrida in philosophy, Freud and Lacan on destructive  pleasure, and explore the terrains opened up by Thomas De Quincey's  \"Confessions of an Opium Eater\" to Flaubert's \"Madame  Bovary,\" and Boroughs' and Dennis Coopers' works to see how imaginary  worlds collide with acts of legal and social policing. Prepare for the  intellectual rush of a lifetime! V51.0488 \u2013 Seminar on 20th Century Authors: Bertolt Brecht - Elke  Siegel  Bertolt Brecht\u2019s profound and influential work as a poet and dramatist, as  theater director and theorist of the \u2018epic theater\u2019, as writer for radio and  film encapsulates history, political or literary-aesthetic, of the 20th  century, affording a unique perspective on the pervasive question of the  relationship between politics and art. Having celebrated his first successes in  the Weimar Republic, Brecht\u2019s major dramatic works were written in exile, while  upon his return to the GDR Brecht, with the Berlin Ensemble, was able to  realize a style of theatrical performance which is influential to this day. The  course aims, 1) to give an overview of Brecht\u2019s work in different genres \u2013  prose, poetry, drama, theory \u2013 ranging from the beginnings in the Weimar  Republic to the 1950s; 2) to touch upon trends and figures influencing Brecht  (e.g., the comedian Karl Valentin, avant-garde theater director Erwin Piscator,  mass sports events); and 3) to discuss the profound influence Brecht has  exerted on literature and theater (e.g., the dramatist and theater director  Heiner M\u00fcller).   FALL 2009  V51.0111  - Conversation/Composition: Berlin -   Elke Siegel Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with a solid grasp on  German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of the German  language, history, politics, and culture through reading, discussion and  writing. Conversation &amp; Composition is a writing intensive course. This  course explores German culture, literature, and politics from the Weimar  Republic to the fall of the Wall and unification (1917-1990s) through an  examination of the city of Berlin. Topics include: the question of the  metropolis; the Weimar Republic; the Nazi dictatorship; rebuilding Berlin; two  Berlins; 1968; multiculturalism; the fall of the wall. An emphasis will be  placed on refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills,  developing the ability to discuss and argue opinions, as well as a thorough  review of grammar. We will work with a selection of written and visual  narratives, including literature (e.g., D\u00f6blin, Enzensberger, Delius, Brussig,  Wolf, \u00d6zdamar, Lange-M\u00fcller), historical, political and sociological texts  (e.g., Georg Simmel, Rudi Dutschke), journals, newspaper accounts, official  documents, architecture, and films/film clips (Berlin: Die Sinfonie der  Gro\u00dfstadt, Menschen am Sonntag, M, Kuhle Wampe, Berlin Alexanderplatz, Die  M\u00f6rder sind unter uns, Sonnenallee, Good Bye Lenin, Das Leben der Anderen).  V51.0153 - Techniques of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation  through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds.  While engaging in the craft of translation first hand, students will encounter  diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus  gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. The course also stresses  the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for  effective reading comprehension as well as written expression. A background  reader in English will familiarize students with historical and theoretical  implications of translation. Photocopies of primary texts in German (and English) to be translated will be  distributed by the instructor. Materials include newspaper and magazine  articles; recipes; TV- and print advertisements; scientific and philosophical  articles; pop material such as hip hop and rap songs, cartoons; Literary texts:  prose, theater, poetry, libretti, among others.  V51.0249  - Intro to Cultural Studies -   Kathrin DiPaola An interdisciplinary tool kit to read realities The terms \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cCultural Studies\u201d have become magical formulas to  describe the intricacies of our presence. They are applied to explain and  investigate any angle of our multi-facetted social and historical realities  spanning from pop culture via business culture to even the culture of war. However, to fully understand the underlying definitions of the vast term  \u201cculture,\u201d it is necessary to comprehend its pluralistic lines of theoretical  tradition. Beginning with the framework of the Birmingham Center for Cultural  Studies in England and its most famous intellectual Stuart Hall, this course  brings together ideas from critical theory, cultural studies, film, and  literature to analyze the development and strategic use of discourses of race,  class, and gender in contemporary society. Bridging the gap between high  culture and street culture, the course offers students a basic,  interdisciplinary \u201ctool kit\u201d with which to read contemporary culture in its  literary, cinematic, and other popular forms.  V51.0244  - The German Intellectual Tradition: Critical Theory - Paul Fleming This course introduces students to German Critical Thought, beginning with its  roots in the 19th century (e.g., Marx and Nietzsche) and following its  trajectory to the Frankfurt School (e.g., Adorno, Benjamin) and beyond (e.g.,  Bakthin, Barthes). Established in 1930 at the Institute for Social Research,  the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a  pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European  social sciences, and continues to exert influence in contemporary social theory  and cultural studies. Often known simply as \u201cCritical Theory,\u201d their key works  cover a vast array of intellectual and political concerns, from the critique of  state capitalism, industrial society, and instrumental reason to commentaries  on mass culture, aesthetics, fashion, fascism, and psychoanalysis. The  interdisciplinary undertakings span many academic subjects and traditions of  economics, sociology, philosophy, literature, art, psychology, pol itics, and  history. In this course, we will begin with an examination of the central precursors to  Critical Theory in the 19thc and will then undertake a broad survey of the  major writings associated with the Frankfurt School as well as those written in  their wake. This introduction to the programmatic statements and eclectic  reflections of various scholars will highlight the diverse historical  influences, collaborative efforts, and internecine debates that shaped the  intellectual tradition across continents and generations. Authors include:  Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Marcuse, and others.  V51.0390  - Topics in German Cinema: Creature    Features - Viola Kolarov We will examine some literary, philosophical, religious, and cinematic  contemplations of the creature while focusing on the ways in which the  individual and the mass media metabolize the creaturely in response to trauma.  V51.0999  - Senior Honors Seminar -   Dopico-Black  SPRING 2009  V51.0133  - German Culture 1890-1989: Fantasy &amp; Fiction - Viola Kolarov This course explores 20th century German culture, literature, and media through  an examination of the metropolis as a mirror of our contemporary media  experience. Topics include: the family; literary heritage; technical and occult  media; 20th century genres: thriller, dystopia, sci-fi, crime and drama. An  emphasis will be placed on refining written expression, honing listening and  reading skills, as well as a review of grammar .  V51.0152 - Intro to German Literature - Elke Siegel This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of, e.g., hierarchy, love, authority.  V51.0220 - Intro to German Culture - Elke Siegel German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence upon the history  of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only  at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural  history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing you with some of the  most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The  philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche, the music of Mozart and Wagner, the  literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht as well as the  art movements of Dada and Bauhaus will serve as the basis for a discussion of  the complex constellation of \u201cKultur,\u201d politics, and power in the German  intellectual tradition.  V51.0253 - Topics in German Cinema: Media &amp; Psychoanalysis   - Viola Kolarov This course explores the intersections between psychoanalysis and the media  emerging at the time of its conception, most notably film. Since the course  serves as an introduction to the theory and practice of psychoanalysis we will  examine our daily involvements and investments in both the mass media and  therapeutic practices that rely on our ability to communicate. We will read  texts from the classic Freudian tradition, literary works that inhabit the  psychoanalytic corpus, and watch a number of films from Germany and Hollywood  that tell the story of their -- and our -- development.    V51.0401 - Great Books in German: Twilight of the Idols - Eckart Goebel This seminar, conducted in German, is conceived as a careful, introduction to Friedrich  Nietzsche\u2019s highly influential thinking, and style. The first part will, after  an introduction to Also Sprach Zarathustra, provide a close reading of the  first book of Day Break (Morgenr\u00f6te), where Nietzsche develops his idea of a  strictly historical philosophy, and confronts us with his theory of culture.  The second part of this seminar will go step by step through Nietzsche\u2019s  attempt to summarize his entire philosophy in The Twilight of the Idols  (G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung). Finally we will read Nietzsche\u2019s essay on Truth and Lying  and conclude with the interpretation of some of his poems, the  Dionysos-Dithyramben. Copies of the German version of G\u00f6tzend\u00e4mmerung may be  purchased at the NYU Bookstore. The other texts will be available in a reader.  Course requirements: Three written reading responses (2 pages each) and one  final paper (5 pages long).   FALL 2008  V51.0297  \u2013 Jews &amp; Germans, an Intercultural History - Paul North The relationship between German and Jewish cultures has historically been much  more complex than the \u201cand\u201d in the title of this course would lead us to  believe. Influence between the \u201ctwo\u201d cultures often flowed in both directions.  For instance, Enlightenment ideas in Germany strongly influenced the Jewish  Enlightenment or Haskala, while philosophers of the Enlightenment\u2014such as  Immanuel Kant\u2014took cues from a Jewish thinker, Moses Mendelssohn. Similarly,  debates over Jewish emancipation in the early nineteenth century corresponded  to a general opening of society that was part of the coalescence of German  national identity. In this course we will explore the complexities of an  affiliation that spoils the conception of culture as single and unified, based  on proprietary treasures deposited in \u201ca\u201d culture. Beginning with the late  eighteenth century we will consider literary, political, theological, and  philosophical texts, along with films, plays, and operas produced up to the eve  of World War II\u2014all of which represent struggles to understand the association  of the two names \u201cGerman\u201d and \u201cJew.\u201d Regarding names, you might also conceive  of this course as an attempt to come to terms with a statement made by Franz  Kafka, a German-speaking Jewish writer living in Prague in the early 20th  century. \u201cI have nothing in common with the Jews,\u201d he wrote, and then added: \u201cI  have nothing in common with Franz Kafka.\u201d Whatever else it might mean, the  statement expresses ambivalence toward unquestioned acceptance of an identity  such as \u201cZionist,\u201d \u201cassimilationist,\u201d \u201canti-Semite,\u201d and so forth. Instead  Kafka asks a more basic question: what does it mean to have \u201csomething in  common with\u201d \u2026 any proper name? This question will help guide our discussions.  The  Devil\u2019s Lectures - Laurence Rickels Vampire Professor Larry Rickels from UCSB (UC Sucks Blood) presents: THE DEVIL in  Ernest Jones, Freud, and Vilem Flusser, among other masters of  the university. Consideration of the syndications of the Devil's reign  in literature and film completes this tempting offering. Sign up of  your own free will.The medley of texts includes excerpts from THE DEVIL'S  ELIXIRS, THE DAMNED, NEEDFUL THINGS, PARADISE LOST, and CHILDHOOD'S END,  among many others. We begin with film clips from SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS  and THE RACE WITH THE DEVIL, rev up with clips from DEMONS and DEMONS 2,  and advance to the slow clip of such Luciferian works as INAUGURATION  OF THE PLEASURE DOME. In between we will also consider -- and exploit!  -- some of the better known Devil films.  Germany  Culture, Politics &amp; Society: Berlin 1900: Lifestyles - Viola Kolarov This course explores the culture, literature and language of Berlin at the turn  of the 20th century. Topics include mores and ethics, inheritance, mental  health, and contemporary tabloid culture. An emphasis will be placed on  refining written expression, honing listening and reading skills, and reviewing  grammar and vocabulary.  SPRING 2008  Introduction  to German Literature   - Sladja Blazan This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres \u2013 poetry, prose, drama \u2013 some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  German  Intellectual Tradition: Friendship   - Elke Siegel The topic of friendship in recent years has experienced a renaissance.  Disciplines as different as anthropology, literary studies, philosophy, and  sociology have developed a new and invigorated interest in the theory and  practice of friendship as a utopia of a community of individuals differing  radically from those communities based on family or nation. Whereas friendship  was once defined by proximity, similarity, and mutuality, in modern  manifestations and discussions friendship tends towards distance, difference,  and asymmetry (see Derrida\u2019s Politics of Friendship ). The course  explores crucial reflections on friendship in changing contexts and discourses:  Antiquity (Plato, Aristotle, Cicero), Montaigne\u2019s and Bacon\u2019s friendship essays  of the 17thcentury, the 18th century German \u2018cult of friendship\u2019 (Klopstock,  Schiller), and Romanticism(Tieck); the re-configurations of friendship in  modernity (Nietzsche, Kafka, Bernhard);sociology\u2019s investigation of the friend  as the locus of discretion and tact (Simmel); the notion of friendship as \u201ca  way of life\u201d (Foucault) and as a moral phenomenon (Blum) of particular  importance for feminism (Friedman).  Readings  in Contemporary Theory: Outrageous Texts   - Avital Ronell; Nicola Behrmann M.A. This class will explore over-the-top texts by means of contemporary theoretical  works of Walter Benjamin, Jacques Derrida, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous and other crucial  writers and philosophers. This much can be said in anticipation: readings will  be slow and intense, at once fabulous and frustrating, because we no longer believe  in wrapping up the meaning of inexhaustible texts or achieving transparency. If  you need subtitles to understand this description, the class will provide them  for you. The texts will be mostly culled from the French, German, and English  canon, ranging from Kleist\u2019s MARQUISE OF O to Kathy Acker\u2019s version of DON  QUIXOTE, and including Werner Herzog\u2019s movie MY BEST FIEND.  FALL 2007  Techniques  of Translation - Andrea Dortmann This course introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of  translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural  backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation first hand,  students will encounter diverse contrastive grammatical, syntactical, and  stylistic problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German  language. The course also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and  complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension as  well as written expression.  Composition  &amp; Conversation: Berlin(s)   -Yevgeniy Pomerantsev This course explores 20th (and 21st) century German culture through a focus on  the city of Berlin and its multiple incarnations as capital (Imperial Reich,  Weimar Republic, Nazi Reich, divided city, GDR and reunified Germany). We will  examine the birth of Germany's first modern metropolis and its subsequent  division and reunification after 1989, focusing also on the post-unification  phenomenon of \"Ostalgie.\" We will work with a variety of written and  visual narratives, including short stories, poetry, film, Feuilleton pieces,  and a novel.  Modern  German Drama - Elke Siegel  V51.0999  Senior Honors Seminar -   Elke Siegel  SPRING 2007       Germany  Culture, Politics and Society: Minority Cultures and Media , - Janelle Blankenship The course explores contemporary German culture, politics, and society, with  special focus on minority cultures and media.

European  Avant-garde Cinema   - Janelle Blankenship This course examines the history, politics, and aesthetics of European  avant-garde film. We will discuss concepts of political modernism, the  culture industry, and the aesthetics of shock. Diverse movements will be  considered, including Expressionism, Soviet Agit-prop, Dada, and Surrealism.  Post  1945 Literature Erinnerungs/Kulturen/Memory Cultures - Christopher Clark This course provides an overview of German literature, film, and culture since  1945, with an emphasis on the topic of memory. German culture after 1945 has been  preoccupied the memory of war, National Socialism, and the Holocaust; debates  among historians are front-page news, particularly the Historikerstreit   of the 1980s and the Goldhagen-Debatte of the 90s. Literature has been  an important vehicle for the process of Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung , or  coming to terms with the past, and we will discuss texts that both thematize  and perform acts of memory. We will examine various strategies of remembering  and memorializing the past, always asking what the significance of memory is  for the present and future. Furthermore, we will examine a range of memory  cultures, considering memories of the 1950s \"economic miracle,\" the  60s student movement and 70s radicalism, and the GDR and its demise, all of  which coexist and compete with memories of the war and the Holocaust in the  same cultural space. We will read texts and view films by such authors and  directors as Anna Seghers, Elisabeth Langg\u00e4sser, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heinrich  B\u00f6ll, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Margarethe von Trotta, Michael Verhoeven,  Benjamin Wilkomirski, W.G. Sebald, Thomas Brussig, Zafer Senocak, Bernhard  Schlink, and other contemporary writers. All readings, discussion, and writing  in German.  FALL 2006  1989  and Beyond - Christopher Clark 1989 and Beyond is designed for students with a solid grasp of basic German  grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of German language,  history, politics, and culture, through reading, discussion, and writing. It is  a writing-intensive course. This course will explore the literature, film, and  culture of Germany since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the (re-)unification  of East and West Germany in 1990. We will examine a range of aspects of the  culture of contemporary Germany and the \u201cBerlin Republic.\u201d We will work on  refining grammar, vocabulary, and style through frequent writing and revision.  We will work with a variety of written and visual narratives, including short  stories, poetry, newspaper articles, Feuilleton pieces, films, and a  book-length collection of stories.  Conversation  &amp; Composition: Friendship/s   - Andrea Dortmann Conversation &amp; Composition is designed for students with a solid grasp of  German grammar and vocabulary who wish to extend their knowledge of the German  language, history, and culture through reading, discussion and writing.  Conversation &amp; Composition is a reading and writing intensive course. In  this course we will explore representations of friendship/s throughout German  culture from the classics (Goethe and Schiller) to today. The theme of  friendship has occupied writers and philosophers throughout history and is a  topic of current discussion in contemporary humanities. You are invited to read  a great variety of textual genres: ballads, poems, aphorisms, short stories, a  children\u2019s novel, and a theater play. Some of the following issues will guide  our investigation: difference between love and friendship, family and friends,  friends and foes; questions of gender [friendship between men and women, male  bonding, girlfriends], proof of friendship; betrayal, loyalty, idealization;  the question of power, and other problems that you may want to bring up.  Literature  and the Senses - Janelle  Blankenship This course explores twentieth-century German literature, as it strains to  hear, see, touch, and dream of new visions of time and space. We will study  fin-de-si\u00e8cle theories of perception, shock, and trauma (Freud, Ernst Mach,  Georg Simmel) and read naturalist novellas, fantasy novels, crime thrillers,  animal epics etc.  German  for Business - Cornelia Uhlenhaut This course is designed for students who have fulfilled their language  requirement and who wish to learn the terminology and conventions of German in  the business world. This is not a class on German economy per se; it rather  introduces students to the use of German language in professional situations,  thus emphasizing communicational and conversational language skills. In  addition to learning about contemporary Germany and its business culture, our  aim is to build and strengthen your vocabulary, your communication and  presentation skills and to refine your accuracy.   German  Poetry: Lyrical poetry from Goethe to Enzensberger - Eckart Goebel   SPRING 2006  German  Culture, Society, and Politics: From Ostzone to Ostalgie - Christopher Clark This course will explore the literature, culture, and politics of the German  Democratic Republic, commonly referred to as \"East Germany.\" From its  beginning as the Soviet-occupied zone to its foundation as a socialist republic  at the dawn of the Cold War, we will trace how artists and intellectuals  negotiated between their own utopian ideals and the often brutal reality of  daily life in a repressive regime. We will examine the Aufbaujahre of  the 1950s and the failed workers' uprising of 1953, as well as the massive flow  of people into the West, leading to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the  most (literally) concrete symbol of the Cold War. We will read the literature  of the relatively liberal early 70s and then explore the disastrous  consequences of the Wolf Biermann affair for artists and intellectuals in the  late 1970s. We will move on to the events leading to the fall of the Wall and  subsequent public debates over re/unification vs. a \"third way.\"  Finally, we will consider the cultural legacy of the GDR in the 1990s and  beyond, including the remainder of the so-called \"Mauer im Kopf\" and  the phenomenon of \"Ostalgie,\" a widespread nostalgia for many aspects  and artifacts of daily life in East Germany. Readings may include literature by  Bertolt Brecht, Stefan Hermlin, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym, Christa Wolf,  Irmtraud Morgner, Charlotte Worgitzky, Monika Maron, and Thomas Brussig; the  films Coming Out , Sonnenallee , and Good Bye Lenin! ; and a  range of short historical and non-fiction texts. All readings, discussion, and  writing in German.  Introduction  to German Literature   - Martin Sch\u00e4fer This course has two major goals: (1) to introduce students to a selection of  representative authors and exemplary texts of literature written in German  language from the 18th to the 20th century and (2) to develop close and  critical reading skills while learning to express yourselves about literary  texts in German, both in writing and in speaking. Covering the three major  literary genres - poetry, prose, drama - some of the following issues will be  discussed: the depiction of otherness; the representation of time and history;  the uncanny; the relationship between form and content; the economy of human  relationships on the basis of hierarchy, love, authority, among others.  Marx,  Nietzsche, Freud - Paul Fleming This course examines the work of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, three German  authors who in different and decisive ways provided a radically new  understanding of the notions of interpretation, history, the subject, politics,  religion, and art. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive  engagement with and a dialogue between these three thinkers. The seminar  underscores their prevailing actuality and thereby strives to delineate the  origin of much modern thinking.  Early  German Cinema: Science/Sensation/Spectacle   - Janelle Blankenship This course will focus on the sensational origins of cinema in Germany.   We will examine cinema as part of a wider exhibition culture that includes  phantasmagoria ghost projection, magic lanterns, and the  \"edutainement\" of microscopes, X-rays and stereoscopes. Our analysis  of German cinema starts with the body madness of the \"Boxing  Kangaroo\" (from Max and Emil Skladanowsky's 1895 Wintergarten film  program) and ends with colonial cinema (Im deutschen Sudan) and German horror  classics ( Caligari, Genuine, Nosferatu! ). Rare glimpses into the  Skladanowsky retrospective of the Third Reich and a screening of New German  cinema representations of forgotten film pioneers also illuminate the act of  creating a national film history and archive .  Great  Books in German Literature: Technology, Tricks, and the Supernatural - Janelle Blankenship This course considers uncanny moments of magical tricks, technology, and the  supernatural in German literature and film. Diverse historical periods, genres,  and aesthetic styles will be analyzed by way of attention to the overarching  theme of this seminar. Texts include Goethe\u2019s Faust and ETA Hoffmann\u2019s Der  Sandmann . Films include Murnau\u2019s Faust (1926) and Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis   (1927).
