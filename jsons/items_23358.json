Click here to schedule a diagnositc evaluation at the Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment.     For individuals experiencing memory problems, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is the first step toward determining the nature and significance of the problems, and getting the right care. Memory problems can result from many different medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, or they can be a result of normal aging (age-related cognitive decline). A diagnostic evaluation is the only way health care providers can assess a person's condition and provide an accurate diagnosis. The diagnosis then determines appropriate treatment and care options, as well as an accurate forecast of the course of the problem (what doctors call \"a prognosis\").     A diagnostic evaluation can also provide reassurance for aging individuals who are not currently experiencing symptoms, but are concerned about possible memory decline in the future. For these individuals, a diagnostic evaluation provides a basis for comparison with future assessments.     What does a diagnostic evaluation include?     There is no single test that can provide all the information needed to make an accurate diagnosis for memory problems. A diagnostic evaluation, therefore, has many different potential components. It consists of a careful and detailed history of a person's current symptoms (onset and progression), his or her medical history, any current medications that may effect cognition, and a series of tests to assess various aspects of the current mental status. Several medical and neurological tests are also performed to help with the diagnosis by excluding conditions that may be causing or aggravating cognitive impairment.      A diagnostic evaluation generally includes the following components:      Psychometric testing. Psychometric tests objectively measure cognitive performance the accuracy, speed, and quality of various aspects of mental processes. These include tests to assess functions such as immediate and delayed memory, attention, language, executive function, and problem solving.      Neurological examination. A neurological examination assesses language, gait (how a person walks), coordination, reflexes, and sensory perception as they are affected by changes in brain function.      A physical examination. A complete physical examination is performed and includes an electrocardiogram and blood and urine tests. These tests determine the presence or absence of conditions that may cause or aggravate memory deficits. Such conditions include thyroid conditions, vitamin 812 deficiency, electrolyte imbalances, high blood pressure, and heart arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances).      A psychiatric evaluation.This part of the diagnostic evaluation involves assessments that focuson cognition (memory, concentration, and orientation) and how itaffects a person's ability to function in daily activities. It alsoincludes assessments focused on behavior and mood, which may causememory problems, as well as information about the person's past medicaland psychiatric history.      An MRI or CT scan. An MRI or CT scan provides an image of the brain that helps in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or age-related cognitive decline by ruling out such conditions as stroke, brain tumor, or hydrocephalus, all of which can cause cognitive impairment.\u00a0     Once all the tests have been completed, and all laboratory results have been received, the information is reviewed and a diagnostic conclusion is reached.     Care and Treatment after the Diagnosis     A person who is experiencing age-related memory decline may notice a change in the condition over time. A person with dementia will experience changes in cognitive and functional abilities as the disease progresses. To ensure that Centers of Excellence patients understand the change in their status over time the Center suggests diagnostic evaluations and follow-up assessments regularly, as well as ongoing telephone consultation as needed.

The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) is providing researchers and clinicians with an important glimpse into the functional organization of the brains of individuals with autism, and these findings are accelerating the pace of discovery and setting the stage for the next generation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) studies.   ABIDE\u2014cofounded and managed by Adriana Di Martino, MD, research director for autism and assistant professor of child and adolescent psychiatry in the Center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders at NYU Langone\u2019s Child Study Center - provides resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on more than 1,000 people with autism from 17 international sites along with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls. The largest imaging sample available through open sharing is helping to take research out of the traditional silos so that it can better foster discovery and innovation.   Since it began in 2012, the registry has given rise to several significant research papers and poster presentations. One study published in June 2013 in Molecular Psychiatry helped to elucidate the disconnection model of autism by illustrating concurrent hypo- and hyper-connectivity in different regions of the brains of individuals with autism. Specifically, MRI images from the ABIDE registry showed hypoconnectivity in the brain\u2019s corticocortical and interhemispheric regions, andhyperconnectivity in the subcortical region, namely, the thalamus. \u201cThe prefrontal cortex has always been considered important in autism, but these studies are highlighting the role of other circuits, like the thalamus,\u201d Dr. Di Martino says.   \u201cThere are too many neurons and not enough pruning of the pathways in the brains of people with autism, which disrupts neural circuitry,\u201d adds Melissa Nishawala, MD, assistant professor of child and adolescent psychiatry and medical director of the Autism Spectrum Disorders Clinical and Research Program at NYU Langone\u2019s Child Study Center. \u201cResting state fMRIs show these connections, and it looks like noise until you tune in and a pattern appears, and then . . . wow! Even when a child is doing nothing, their social centers, motor centers, and language centers are communicating with each other. This is important for coordinating, gesturing, speaking, and socializing.\u201d   The hope is that these studies will provide insights into the mechanism of the pathophysiology responsible for autism and ultimately lead to the development of more effective therapies that can be implemented earlier than is currently possible. \u201cThe earlier we make the diagnosis, the sooner we can do something about autism,\u201d Dr. Nishawala says.   There is progress even as ABIDE data are culled, says Dr. Nishawala. Child psychiatrists and autism specialists at NYU Langone are helping families move beyond the label and toward therapies that work. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say a kid has autism. You have to look at the other things going on. There are many choices for helping each child,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are hoping in the future to use brain scans to predict which treatment will be most beneficial to a child with autism and to track the child\u2019s progress.   \u201cThe challenge in treating autism is to identify the strengths and weaknesses in each patient and use the best therapies available for them,\u201d Dr. Nishawala says. The Child Study Center offers several types of therapies in addition to gold-standard applied behavior analysis, including pivotal response treatment, the Early Start Denver Model, and others. The therapists at the center match these treatments to individuals based on their needs, strengths, and weaknesses.

This is important for coordinating, gesturing, speaking, and socializing.\u201d   The hope is that these studies will provide insights into the mechanism of the pathophysiology responsible for autism and ultimately lead to the development of more effective therapies that can be implemented earlier than is currently possible. \u201cThe earlier we make the diagnosis, the sooner we can do something about autism,\u201d Dr. Nishawala says.   There is progress even as ABIDE data are culled, says Dr. Nishawala. Child psychiatrists and autism specialists at NYU Langone are helping families move beyond the label and toward therapies that work. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say a kid has autism. You have to look at the other things going on. There are many choices for helping each child,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are hoping in the future to use brain scans to predict which treatment will be most beneficial to a child with autism and to track the child\u2019s progress.   \u201cThe challenge in treating autism is to identify the strengths and weaknesses in each patient and use the best therapies available for them,\u201d Dr. Nishawala says. The Child Study Center offers several types of therapies in addition to gold-standard applied behavior analysis, including pivotal response treatment, the Early Start Denver Model, and others. The therapists at the center match these treatments to individuals based on their needs, strengths, and weaknesses.

Before we begin working with your child, your child&rsquo;s tutor will conduct a diagnostic evaluation to determine your child&rsquo;s reading strengths and challenges. Unlike the psychological evaluation process conducted by schools, our diagnostic evaluation is very practical in nature. Depending on your child&rsquo;s age, we will administer a few tests to answer questions such as:       What is my child&rsquo;s instructional reading level?    Is my child able to efficiently attack an unknown word during reading?    What aspects of decoding, spelling and phonics are under my child&rsquo;s control? What aspects of decoding, spelling, and phonics does my child need to learn next?    Is my child reading fluently compared to other children his/her age?    How does my child&rsquo;s comprehension compare to his/her age peers? What aspects of the comprehension process are in place? What comprehension skills need to be developed?    Does my child&rsquo;s writing in response to reading adequately reflect a high level of comprehension?    Is my child applying effective reading and writing strategies in the content areas, such as science and social studies?    How is my child&rsquo;s attitude about reading influencing his/her progress?       This diagnostic evaluation will inform our instructional focus for your child. In our reading clinic, every child receives an individual program based on his or her assessment results. A few weeks after the clinic sessions end, you will receive a copy of your child&rsquo;s diagnostic evaluation. We recommend that you share this information with your child&rsquo;s teachers. The package will include:       Pretest Results    An evaluation of your child&rsquo;s reading strengths and reading needs    An instructional plan    A description of the tutoring that was conducted    Posttest results    A summary of outcomes    Recommendations for future instruction       Sample Diagnostic Evaluations       First Grade Diagnostic Evaluation    Seventh Grade Diagnostic Evaluation                This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
