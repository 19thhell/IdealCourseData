Diaz (GAL &rsquo;99, TSOA &rsquo;02)  obsessively followed matches, collected action figures, and even immersed himself in  role-playing games (think Dungeons & Dragons with wrestlers). Though his passion waned  somewhat in high school, it rebounded in the late 1990s as a renaissance at World Wrestling  Entertainment, or WWE, spawned Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson and Stone Cold Steve Austin.  His encyclopedic knowledge landed him a side job as one of the first professional-wrestling  bloggers. It wasn&rsquo;t highbrow work for someone with a master&rsquo;s from the Rita and Burton  Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing in the Tisch School of the Arts, but Diaz felt  truly lucky to land the position. And that luck kept paying off&mdash;the gig inspired him to  pen a play that was nominated for the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in Drama.               Diaz&rsquo;s unconventional writing style helped his latest play  become a finalist for the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in Drama.   The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity &mdash;which uses wrestling&rsquo;s decidedly unsubtle milieu   to explore thorny issues of racial identity, authenticity, and American culture&mdash;was    originally produced by the Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago in 2009, and then off-Broadway    by Second Stage Theatre the following spring. Reviewers swooned. The New York Times&rsquo;    Ben Brantley welcomed the &ldquo;delicious crackle and pop of a galloping, honest-to-God,    all-American satire.&rdquo; Backstage said that the play &ldquo;will body-slam you to the canvas    with a one-two punch of political satire and theatrical showmanship.&rdquo; In addition to    being a Pulitzer finalist, Chad Deity snagged the Obie and Lucille Lortel awards for    Best Play.    Chad Deity &rsquo;s narrative stems from a controversy that erupted during Diaz&rsquo;s stint in   the early  blogosphere. In December 2004, WWE introduced Muhammad Hassan, a patriotic Muslim-American  wrestler facing harassment in post-9/11 society. (True to wrestling&rsquo;s artifice, Hassan was  played by Mark Copani, an Italian-American from Syracuse, New York.) At a time when many  pundits and politicians wore xenophobia like a badge of honor, presenting a beefy Muslim  as a misunderstood good guy sparked tremendous buzz, with Diaz and others impressed by the  risky choice. But Hassan and his creators soon retreated back into stereotypes. &ldquo;It fell  apart very quickly and turned into &lsquo;Oh, you actually are a terrorist,&rsquo; &rdquo; Diaz recalls.       Diaz, who the Times recently presented with its 2011 Outstanding Playwright Award,   had spent a lot of time thinking about race as a Puerto Rican raised in a predominately    Jewish enclave of Westchester County. At a young age, Diaz noticed how his own affect   shifted from one environment to another. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think of it in racial or ethnic    terms, but you know the difference between spending time with your Jewish friends    in Yonkers and your Puerto Rican cousins, basically in the street in the Bronx,&rdquo; he   explains.           showboat Chad Deity is the title character of Diaz&rsquo;s hit play, which uses a wrestling ring  to examine race issues.              Such contrasts run throughout Chad Deity . Mace, the protagonist, is a Puerto Rican   wrestler who gets paid to lose matches, and worries about the social and personal cost   of being a Latino fall guy. The title character, a bling-laden showboat who refers    to himself in the third person, represents a new black stereotype that obliterates    any discussion of racial self-consciousness. And then there&rsquo;s the Fundamentalist,    a terrorist &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; played by an Indian-American ethnic chameleon, whom Mace plucks    from obscurity and quickly loses control over. These characters inhabit an America    that hasn&rsquo;t fully shifted from a black-white concept of race. &ldquo;You talk about Latino    being a race constructed of other races&mdash;what the hell is that?&rdquo; Diaz asks. &ldquo;The whole   language is insufficient. But at the same time, it&rsquo;s a conversation that needs to    be had.&rdquo;      Just don&rsquo;t expect that conversation to come about in a conventional fashion. Diaz&rsquo;s   plays&mdash;which total six in all&mdash;interweave traditional scenes, direct-address monologues,   PowerPoint presentations, and, in the case of his first play, Welcome to Arroyo&rsquo;s ,    break dancing and beatboxing. Characters comment on the play&rsquo;s theatrical devices,    and then comment on the comments. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about that kind of style that    helps me actually say what I want to say, which is not straightforward,&rdquo; Diaz explains.   &ldquo;I think it also has to do with growing up in the MTV generation, and now the Twitter   generation&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think narrative can be simple today in the way it may have been in the past.  Because we do bounce around.&rdquo; Fittingly, Diaz says he usually writes in multimedia  hurricanes of his own creation: &ldquo;I have Facebook open, and Twitter open, and the  television&rsquo;s on&mdash;with no sound&mdash;and then I have music on, playing something else.&rdquo;      When he&rsquo;s not making art, he&rsquo;s nurturing new artists. For years, Diaz has taught   and mentored young writers at numerous public schools in New York, including El   Puente Academy for Peace and Justice in Brooklyn. He&rsquo;s also busy keeping up with   Chad Deity &rsquo;s ever-expanding calendar&mdash;new productions of the play are in the works    at the Actors Theatre of Louisville and the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles.    Meanwhile, L.A.&rsquo;s Center Theatre Group, Chicago&rsquo;s Goodman Theatre, and the Oregon    Shakespeare Festival have all commissioned new works from Diaz. Although it can be   overwhelming, the 34-year-old keeps perspective on how hard it is for most young    playwrights to break through. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable,&rdquo; he concedes. &ldquo;For a first production    to explode like this, on a play that feels very much like my voice on my terms&mdash;I&rsquo;m very,   very lucky.&rdquo;    Photos from top: &copy; Ileia Burgos; &copy; Joan Marcus                            &ldquo;Growing up in the MTV  generation, and now the Twitter generation&hellip;I don&rsquo;t think narrative can be simple today in the way it may have been in the past.&rdquo;"}]},

As the only studio training actors, directors, designers, playwrights and creators of devised work in a single setting, Playwrights Horizons offers students an unparalleled opportunity for the cross-fertilization of skills, a commitment to the collaborative nature of theater and a dedication to the principle that each student is a whole artist to be nurtured, challenged and celebrated. Rigorous training with our diverse faculty of professional artists working in traditional, global and avant-garde performance styles, challenges each student to discover and bring forth the artist within. As the student progresses through the program, the balance shifts from projects that support foundational class work, to class work that supports the needs of the artist in the development and production of actual work. Projects offer the opportunity to collaborate with fellow students, recent alumni, faculty professionals and guest mentors creating a network of feedback and support that serves as a bridge to the world beyond studio walls. Our project-driven methodology ensures that students emerge from the program with the physical, emotional and intellectual strength and flexibility their work requires. Our students develop, as well, a deep connection to their own personal vision and appetite for artistic risk that will enable them to define their own unique path as artists, citizens and human beings. The school is part of Playwrights Horizons Theater, one of New York\u2019s most successful off-Broadway nonprofit theaters and producer of such shows as the Tony nominated Grey Gardens, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Sunday in the Park with George, Driving Miss Daisy and I Am My Own Wife, as well as the Obie Award-winning Circle, Mirror, Transformation and Clybourne Park.
