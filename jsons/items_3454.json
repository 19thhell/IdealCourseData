The department lists many positions, as does the Tisch Office of Student Affairs.     Students also take advantage of the many special events the department and the university sponsor. In addition to panel discussions, guest speakers, film series, and readings, the department often hosts major conferences. Some of the topics of these conferences of recent years include The Pan-African Film Conference, The Orson Welles Conference, The Brecht Conference, Hitchcock: A Centennial Celebration and most recently, The Urban Generation Chinese Cinema Conference and the 50th Anniversary of the Cahiers Du Cinema Conference.    Students are also urged to go to the many free screenings here in the department and the university. Our Saturday Cinematheque series continues through the academic year and new films are screened here from both the independent and commercial industries.     New York City is an exceptional place to study film and media. There are several world renowned and outstanding museums with incredible archives and screening programming as well as a host of revival houses within walking distance of campus. top If I have additional questions how can I find out more information? You may also contact the department and speak with the program coordinator, Kenneth Sweeney for information on the M.A. and PHD programs in Cinema Studies or Alicia Kubes for the MIAP program. Both can be reached at 212-998-1600. top Is it possible to come and visit the NYU campus? Students interested in visiting the campus are welcome to do so.
