It combines topics and methods drawn from the humanities and social sciences to analyze the relationships among individuals, groups, institutions, governments, economies, and environments. Our courses draw on theoretical insights from social geography, feminism and queer studies, ethnic studies, critical race theory, labor studies, and cultural studies. Our programs of study value both historical inquiry and engagement with the present, especially regarding large-scale developments like urbanization, commodification, movement of peoples, transnational exchange, identity formations, and ethnic and diasporic cultures.      SCA houses and integrates the activities of six programs\u2014Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies. NYU students can major in any one of these or combine them in the SCA general major. Minors are offered in all areas. At the graduate level the department offers MAs in Social and Cultural Analysis and Africana Studies and a PhD in American Studies.   SCA\u2019s programs appeal to students who seek a critical understanding of society, ways to connect the lives and concerns of local communities to national and global dynamics, and ways to connect intellectual inquiry with lived experience. New York City is a crucible for the department's work, both in its community orientation and its connections to global networks. The department has a robust internship program that is highly recommended for all majors.     Details on each of the majors and minors can be found under the individual links on the home page. SCA majors offer overall intellectual development and preparation for many fields including law, government, public service, public policy, cultural or political advocacy, community organization, teaching, public administration, and journalism.
