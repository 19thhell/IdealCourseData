South Asian  history has been the locus for key debates --- from those on the origins of  early trans-oceanic merchant networks to those on the making of new forms of  imperial rule, on nationalism and decolonization, and on subaltern studies,  postcolonialism, and globalization --- which have had a broad comparative and  methodological reach. The history of early modern and modern South Asia has been  approached by multiple perspectives. Our South Asian history faculty offers a  temporally, regionally, and conceptually diverse illustration of existing and  emergent perspectives. The core historians of South Asia in the department are Manu  Goswami, David Ludden, and Andrew Sartori. Their research spans regional (north  and south), linguistic (Bengali, Tamil, Hindi, Urdu), epochal (pre-modern and  modern) and thematic (social, intellectual, cultural) divisions of conventional  historical studies. The graduate program encourages the forging of comparative  and global approaches to the social, intellectual, and cultural history of  South Asia. It builds upon and bolsters existing department interests in  comparative and international history, imperial and post-imperial formations,  social and intellectual history. Beyond the department, graduate studies of  South Asia at NYU galvanize the inter-disciplinary strength of faculty across  schools (Steinhardt, Arts and Sciences, Gallatin, Stern, Tisch, and Law) and  departments (Anthropology, Media and Communication, Political Science,  Sociology, Social and Cultural Analysis). With the help of our colleagues inside  and outside the Department of History, we encourage students to undertake  methodologically innovative and interdisciplinary historical research based on  multiple regional and linguistic archives.      South Asian Languages : At present beginner  and advanced courses in Hindi, Urdu and Persian are offered at NYU. Columbia  University and University of Pennsylvania offer a wider range of language  training (Tamil, Telegu, Bengali) and there are several summer programs at  various centers around the country. Students are expected to enter the program  with demonstrable proficiency in at least one South Asian language.      Workshops and Seminars : South Asian Studies at NYU provides is expansive academic  opportunities, connecting faculty and scholars in many schools, and including  weekly seminars and other events on most Fridays during the school year, as  well as an annual conference, in February, on Global South Asia. We have an  interdisciplinary Graduate Student Workshop specifically for students in South  Asian Studies working in various departments and schools. A number of thematic  other workshops provide students and faculty with a forum to present ongoing  research, host outside speakers, and collectively read works of interest across  regions and fields. Existing workshops organized by South Asia history faculty  include Social Theory and History and the Global Caf\u00e9 (administered by the  Institute of Public Knowledge). We also strongly encourage students to  participate in other South Asia related and trans-regional events at area  universities.

It is a CAS minor and can be taken by students in any NYU   school. It provides a broad perspective on South Asia and opportunities   to concentrate on specific areas of interest. Students have many   choices of courses and course combinations. The course list (located   below) represents current offerings in 2011, and the list may change in   the years to come. There are a wide range of options. Students might   choose to study a language and its literature, colonial and postcolonial   histories, art and architecture, contemporary politics, literary forms,   cinema, and the South Asian diaspora, among other topics. The South   Asia curriculum is constantly expanding across departments and schools,   and now includes courses in anthropology, history, political science,   fine art, film studies, cultural studies, literature, and two modern   languages (Hindi and Urdu). Through a consortium with Columbia   University, students may also study other of the region\u2019s many modern or   classical languages.                             Declaring the Minor:                                In order to declare  the South Asian Studies minor, you must complete the South Asian Minor declaration form  and  submit it to the Undergraduate Administrative Assistant in the History Department.                        Requirements:              The minimum requirement for completion of a minor is four 4-point courses (16 points) chosen in consultation with the South Asian studies advisor. Students are encouraged to register for the minor and consult the advisor before completing their course requirements.    One CORE/MAP \u201cCultures and Contexts\u201d course on South Asia may be counted toward the non-language minor requirement. At least two of the four non-language courses must be above the introductory level in their respective disciplines. With prior approval, one independent study course can count toward the four courses required for a minor. At least three of the four courses must be completed at NYU.    The South Asian studies Faculty Advisor, Prof. David Ludden, will determine the eligibility of courses taken in study abroad programs of institutions not part of the consortial exchange, or other courses that students think might be applied to the minor.    Students can pursue three broad areas of concentration with four 4-point courses (16 points):    Track A: Language and Literature. This track provides students with a solid foundation in a modern Indian language. Students must complete a four-semester sequence of either Hindi or Urdu, provided that these courses are not also used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement.    Track B: History, Culture, and Politics: This track fosters a broad interdisciplinary perspective on South Asia. All four courses must be non-language courses. At least two courses must be above the introductory level in their respective disciplines.    Track C: Culture and Language, combining Tracks A and B. Students must take two language courses at the intermediate level (provided that these courses are not also used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement) or advanced level, plus two non-language South Asian studies courses.         *Students may apply any course offered  by one of the South Asian faculty with the Faculty Advisor\u2019s approval      South Asian Studies Course Offerings:    *Please note that this list is subject to change, and available courses may vary depending upon the semester.
