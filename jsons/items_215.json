We engage new media, technologies and performance while tracing their origins in ancient communities, Shamanism and Ritual. We explore the relationships between new media/performance forms and traditional artistic practice. We ask such questions such as: Why is New York still the capital of the art world? Why has everything in our culture and art become dominated by the money and power of the finance world, by the one-tenth of the one percent? Has money alone become the standard by which art and culture in general are valued? We pursue these questions by learning with guest artists, visiting museums, through imaginative writing, making art and through individual and group projects.

Description       This course focuses on the contemporary art world and the forces producing continuous change and the re-creation of tradition. We examine new media, technologies and performance and trace their origins in ancient communities, shamanism and ritual. We explore the relationships between new media/performance forms and traditional artistic practices. We ask such questions as: What is the importance of place in energizing creativity? Have the forces of the art world shifted from capital cities outward toward unexpected influences and movements? Is New York still the capital of the art world? We pursue these questions by visiting museums and galleries, through imaginative writing and making art; and through individual and group projects.
