PUBLIC HISTORY    The program in public history provides Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy candidates with the opportunity to prepare for careers as historians in public and private institutions outside academia, where historical perspectives address areas as diverse as public policy, museum programs, and historical dramatizations for media. The program offers students three areas of historical work: media history, local and community history, and history and public policy.    All entering students enroll in a sequential two-semester seminar in public history that introduces students to literature and problems in the various public history arenas. Students complete a major research essay and then translate that research into a public history format for a public audience.    The concentration in public history is open to all qualified M.A. and Ph.D. students. It consists of the introductory sequence; a course in one of the three tracks; a methodological course in either oral history or quantitative methods ( G57.2012 or G57.2019), and four electives in the department, of which one should be a research seminar. Public history can satisfy the departmental requirement for a secondary field. For Americanists, the courses must be comparative or in another field or in some combination thereof.    M.A. students may elect instead to complete a 44-point program leading to a New York State Board of Regents Certificate in Public History. In addition to requiring all the courses in the concentration, the certificate program requires students to take the two remaining introductory track courses and Literature of the Field: America to 1865 ( G57.1600). Finally, all public history students should complement class work with internships in various participating agencies in theNew York metropolitan area.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program. Inquiries should be addressed to Professor Paul Mattingly, Director, Program in Public History, Department of History, Faculty of Arts and Science, New York University, 19 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4556.

ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT AND HISTORICAL EDITING    The program in archival management and historical editing offers students the opportunity to combine either a Master of Arts or a Ph.D. degree in history with an Advanced Certificate in Archival Management and Historical Editing. The certificate program is also open to students with an M.A. or a Ph.D. degree in another appropriate social science- or humanities-based discipline. Ph.D. candidates in history may also elect to use the archives program as a second field, and Ph.D. students wishing to complete the entire program may apply 12 of the 20 required points toward their Ph.D. requirements.    Since 1977, this program has trained graduate history students for careers as archivists, historical editors, administrators, and manuscript curators. The program provides students with a solid foundation in the theory, methodology, and practice of archives. It also emphasizes the broad humanistic training in history necessary for archivists to develop a vision for their work. Course work in complementary disciplines and new technologies is stressed, ensuring that program graduates remain current with professional trends and developments. New York City offers a unique setting and laboratory for students exploring history and archives, and the program takes full advantage of the city\u2019s repositories in providing internships and practicum experiences for its students. Program graduates work as archivists in a wide variety of academic, nonprofit, corporate, and governmental venues. The program\u2019s unique historical editing component also trains historians for alternative careers in preserving and disseminating historical documents in book, microform, CD-ROM, and electronic formats.    All entering students enroll in a sequential, two-semester colloquium ( G57.1010 and G57.2010) that offers a broad overview of the field and combines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in an archival setting. Over the course of two semesters, students complete a major research paper on an appropriate archival topic and arrange and describe two archival collections in conjunction with their practicum. Students are also required to take a course in historical editing, which focuses on the location, arrangement, and publication of documents. As part of this course, students undertake research to identify and annotate their documentary collection.    M.A. students enroll in a 44-point program of study, leading to the Master of Arts degree in history and to the certificate. Requirements for the M.A. degree and the advanced certificate are 24 points in history (which must include an M.A. seminar) and 20 points in archives. Students are required to complete 12 points in the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010. Students successfully completing the program must have 16 points with a grade of B or better. Students with more than 4 points below B are not eligible for the certificate and may not register for additional courses.    Students holding an appropriate master\u2019s degree in a social science or humanities discipline may be accepted into the program on a nondegree, certificate- only basis. Such students are permitted to register for 20 points in archives to complete the requirements. Ph.D. students in history wishing to use archives as a second field are required to complete the three core courses G57.1010, G57.1012, and G57.2010.    Through a consortium arrangement with Long Island University\u2019s Palmer School of Library and Information Science, students are also able to enroll in more library-oriented courses offered at Bobst Library and to apply these credits toward their certificate. Students should check with the director for a complete list ofPalmerSchool offerings.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program.

SPECIAL PROJECTS    The Margaret Sanger Papers Project collects, assembles, and publishes records documenting the life and career of the founder of the American birth control movement. Located in the department since 1987, the Sanger Papers Project microfilmed the Smith College Collections Series, consisting of almost 45,000 documents; in 1995 an additional 9,000 documents gathered in an international search were microfilmed as the Collected Documents Series. Both microfilmed series are being published by University Publications of America, along with a reel guide and index. The project is preparing an electronic edition of the microfilmed documents for distribution on CD-ROM or via the Internet. The project will then work on a four-volume book edition of selected Sanger letters. The project employs graduate assistants and other students. Documents from the Sanger Papers collection are available for student and faculty research and serve as practical examples for the course on historical editing.    For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor of the Margaret Sanger Papers.    The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and translating the entire extant public and private correspondence of earlyNew York governor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) for publication in microfilm and annotated book editions. Considered by some colonial historians as the \u201cFather of American Democracy\u201d and best known for the 1689New York uprising that bears his name, Leisler played a prominent role in the economic and social development of colonial New York and earlyAmerica. Housed in the department since 1988, the Leisler Papers collection contains over 3,000 documents in Dutch, French, German, and English that provide a wealth of information on the Atlantic world in the early modern era. The project employs graduate and other students to assist in making the collection available to scholars and the public.

PUBLIC HISTORY    The program in public history provides Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy candidates with the opportunity to prepare for careers as historians in public and private institutions outside academia, where historical perspectives address areas as diverse as public policy, museum programs, and historical dramatizations for media. The program offers students three areas of historical work: media history, local and community history, and history and public policy.    All entering students enroll in a sequential two-semester seminar in public history that introduces students to literature and problems in the various public history arenas. Students complete a major research essay and then translate that research into a public history format for a public audience.    The concentration in public history is open to all qualified M.A. and Ph.D. students. It consists of the introductory sequence; a course in one of the three tracks; a methodological course in either oral history or quantitative methods ( G57.2012 or G57.2019), and four electives in the department, of which one should be a research seminar. Public history can satisfy the departmental requirement for a secondary field. For Americanists, the courses must be comparative or in another field or in some combination thereof.    M.A. students may elect instead to complete a 44-point program leading to a New York State Board of Regents Certificate in Public History. In addition to requiring all the courses in the concentration, the certificate program requires students to take the two remaining introductory track courses and Literature of the Field: America to 1865 ( G57.1600). Finally, all public history students should complement class work with internships in various participating agencies in theNew York metropolitan area.    Enrollment is limited, and admission must be approved by the director of the program. Inquiries should be addressed to Professor Paul Mattingly, Director, Program in Public History, Department of History, Faculty of Arts and Science, New York University, 19 University Place, New York, NY 10003-4556.

ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT AND HISTORICAL EDITING    The program in archival management and historical editing offers students the opportunity to combine either a Master of Arts or a Ph.D. degree in history with an Advanced Certificate in Archival Management and Historical Editing. The certificate program is also open to students with an M.A. or a Ph.D. degree in another appropriate social science- or humanities-based discipline. Ph.D. candidates in history may also elect to use the archives program as a second field, and Ph.D. students wishing to complete the entire program may apply 12 of the 20 required points toward their Ph.D. requirements.    Since 1977, this program has trained graduate history students for careers as archivists, historical editors, administrators, and manuscript curators. The program provides students with a solid foundation in the theory, methodology, and practice of archives. It also emphasizes the broad humanistic training in history necessary for archivists to develop a vision for their work. Course work in complementary disciplines and new technologies is stressed, ensuring that program graduates remain current with professional trends and developments. New York City offers a unique setting and laboratory for students exploring history and archives, and the program takes full advantage of the city\u2019s repositories in providing internships and practicum experiences for its students. Program graduates work as archivists in a wide variety of academic, nonprofit, corporate, and governmental venues. The program\u2019s unique historical editing component also trains historians for alternative careers in preserving and disseminating historical documents in book, microform, CD-ROM, and electronic formats.    All entering students enroll in a sequential, two-semester colloquium ( G57.1010 and G57.2010) that offers a broad overview of the field and combines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in an archival setting. Over the course of two semesters, students complete a major research paper on an appropriate archival topic and arrange and describe two archival collections in conjunction with their practicum. Students are also required to take a course in historical editing, which focuses on the location, arrangement, and publication of documents.

SPECIAL PROJECTS    The Margaret Sanger Papers Project collects, assembles, and publishes records documenting the life and career of the founder of the American birth control movement. Located in the department since 1987, the Sanger Papers Project microfilmed the Smith College Collections Series, consisting of almost 45,000 documents; in 1995 an additional 9,000 documents gathered in an international search were microfilmed as the Collected Documents Series. Both microfilmed series are being published by University Publications of America, along with a reel guide and index. The project is preparing an electronic edition of the microfilmed documents for distribution on CD-ROM or via the Internet. The project will then work on a four-volume book edition of selected Sanger letters. The project employs graduate assistants and other students. Documents from the Sanger Papers collection are available for student and faculty research and serve as practical examples for the course on historical editing.    For additional information, contact Dr. Esther Katz, codirector/editor of the Margaret Sanger Papers.    The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project is collecting, transcribing, and translating the entire extant public and private correspondence of earlyNew York governor Jacob Leisler (1640-1691) for publication in microfilm and annotated book editions. Considered by some colonial historians as the \u201cFather of American Democracy\u201d and best known for the 1689New York uprising that bears his name, Leisler played a prominent role in the economic and social development of colonial New York and earlyAmerica. Housed in the department since 1988, the Leisler Papers collection contains over 3,000 documents in Dutch, French, German, and English that provide a wealth of information on the Atlantic world in the early modern era. The project employs graduate and other students to assist in making the collection available to scholars and the public.

Environmental history is the study of the ways in which humans have interacted with, shaped, and been shaped by their physical environments in the past. It takes as a central premise that nature, too, has a history, one profoundly shaped by human beings, and that the record of the human past is incomplete without some account of the role the physical world has played in human events.    Environmental History  of New York City   HIST-UA 596 Offered  every other year. Needham. 4 points.   Investigates topics in  the environmental history of New York City from the 1600s to the  present. From the city\u2019s origins as a harbor city at the  intersection of the Hudson River and the Atlantic, to the Manhattan  bedrock that anchors modern skyscrapers, natural geography has  determined urban possibility. Infrastructure that has become \u201csecond  nature\u201d brings water and electricity to the city and carries its  waste to distant landfills. The park lands that dot the city have  become both playgrounds where New Yorkers seek green space and  battlefields where they fight over the proper ways to enjoy those  spaces.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union. This course traces the evolution of European capitalism   during the twentieth century, from a laissez-faire to a social market   economy. Throughout the semester we will study key themes and turning   points that shaped Europe's economic development: the Great Depression;   the World Wars; alternative ways of organizing an economic life under   fascism and communism; the stagnation of the 1970s; and European   economic integration.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.      Seminar: Topics in  Medieval History   HIST-UA 441   Bedos-Rezak, Griffiths. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Topics in  European Intellectual History   HIST-UA 443   Geroulanos, Shovlin. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Britain since  World War II   HIST-UA 451 Open to  history majors who have completed Historical Studies: Theories and  Practice (HIST-UA 101), or by permission of the instructor. Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.    Colloquium: The Place of Regions in U.S. History HIST-UA 414 Offered every year. 4 points.

Course readings will move between regions and through time as we explore themes including environment, geography, economics, politics, and culture. While class discussions will focus on a series of secondary readings, students are encouraged to draw on a wide range of materials, ranging from music, films, and physical objects to political reports and historical monographs, in writing a research paper that will explore some aspect of regional history in the United States.    Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.   Explores the history of  history writing in the United States, examining national histories  written in the 19th and 20th centuries as part of American  intellectual history. Focuses on theme, interpretation, points of  view, and style in the work of past historians.    Liberalism and Conservatism since the New Deal HIST-UA 418 Offered every year. 4 points. This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.      Seminar: Constructions  of Race in U.S. History   HIST-UA 680 Hodes. 4  points.   Explores the ideas of  race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across  regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language,  color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.      Seminar: Race, Civil  War, Reconstruction   HIST-UA 683 Hodes. 4  points.   The American Civil War  punctuated the 19th century and transformed the nation. This seminar  explores the experiences of slaves and former slaves, politicians and  community leaders, civilians and families, soldiers and veterans, and  proceeds from the premise that slavery and race were central to the  war\u2019s causes and consequences.      Seminar: Ideology and  Social Change in American History   HIST-UA 684 Offered  every other year. 4 points.   Explores classical  arguments in American history concerning social behavior. Central  themes: the power of cultural conditioning, the role of schooling and  other acculturating institutions, the uses of \u201cuplifting\u201d reform  and organizational benevolence, and the intervention of professional  experts into social policymaking. Special attention to the role of  ethnic and racial leaders, proponents of success and socialization,  critical investigations of family and femininity, and analysis of  distinctive generational responses to these and related issues.      Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.   Explores the historical  issues of the Great Depression and the New Deal years, 1933\u20131941,  by discussing several relevant works on this period. Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.

Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.    Colloquium : Gender and  Radicalism in Modern China   HIST-UA 536 Identical  to EAST-UA 536. Offered every year. Karl. 4 points.

Takes up a watershed  event in Japanese history, the greatest single preoccupation of  Japanese historians. The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Global and Special  Topics Seminars    History of the Body HIST-UA 310 Offered every two years. 4 points. History of the Body from Birth to Death. Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture.
