The Department of History offers graduate study in United States history from the colonial settlement to the present. Departmental emphases are in political, urban, social, labor, and intellectual history, from the Civil War to the present. In addition, the department offers two New York state certificate programs, which may be taken in conjunction with the masters or doctoral degree: public history and archival management/historical editing. Concentrations in women's history and African- American history are also available at the master's and doctoral level.   The History Department has close ties to the Program in Metropolitan Studies, an undergraduate sequence focusing on urban culture and policy, and the Program in American Studies, which offers an interdisciplinary approach to modern American culture leading to the master's and doctoral degree. Courses given in the latter program also rely heavily on the collections in cinema, literature, anthropology, and the performing arts.   The collection also supports teaching and research in the following departments, programs, and divisions: Politics, English, Sociology, Africana Studies, Museum Studies, the Gallatin School, the School of Education, and the School of Continuing Education.                 Scope       Language   The collection consists primarily of materials in English. Selection of materials in European languages is highly selective.       Geographical Areas   Emphasis is on the history of the United States, and to a lesser extent the history of Canada. Within the United States, coverage is extensive for New England and the Middle Atlantic States, with particular strengths in the history of New York  City and New York State. Materials on the South are less well-developed; those on the West (west of the Mississippi River) are not collected intensively.       Chronological Periods   The collection includes primary and secondary sources for all periods, from prehistory and early discovery through the Colonial period, nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the present. In keeping with departmental focus, coverage is generally  more extensive for the period from the Civil War to the present, with strong holdings for the twentieth century.                     Types of Materials       Included   Monographs, monographic series, facsimiles, reprints, atlases, conference proceedings, newspapers, journals, microforms, book catalogs of major historical collections and exhibitions, video recordings, CD-ROMS, and electronic texts.       Excluded   Textbooks, manuals, maps, manuscripts, pamphlets, newsletters, and juvenile and popular materials.   Genealogical materials such as birth and death records are not collected, with the exception of certain genealogical reference materials (primarily dictionaries of names) held in General and Humanities Reference. Immigrant records (passenger  lists, registers of birth) are not collected beyond basic bibliographies.                     Strengths &amp; Weaknesses   Based on assessment of the stack collections in LC classes E and F1 - F1200, the general strengths of the collection are in social and political history from the Civil War to the present. For this era both primary and secondary sources are well represented. Highlights are African-American history, women's history; history of New York City and state, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region. (See Section VI for subject and collecting levels.)   Less well represented are primary and secondary sources on the discovery of America and early exploration, the Colonial period, and the American South.   It should be noted that additional materials of interest to historians are located in other LC classes, including JK 1-1600 (politics and government of the United States), HQ (Family, Marriage, Woman), HT (Communities, Classes, Races), and HN (Social History).   In addition, stack materials in all of the above LC classes are complemented and extended by numerous microform sets. These sets are are an important addition to the retrospective book and serial collection and provide access to numerous primary sources. These sets include:     Early American Imprints I and II   Early American Newspapers   Early American Periodicals   Gerritsen Collection of Women's History   State Secession Debates, 1859-1862   State Slavery Statutes   Slavery in Ante-Bellum Southern Industries   American Immigrant Autobiographies   Voices from Ellis Island   Emma Goldman Papers   Papers of W.E.B DuBois   Papers of Margaret Sanger   Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony     Beginning with the early twentieth century, the Government Documents collection in the Social Science Reference Center is an important resource, with collections of Congressional hearings.   The Avery Fisher Center houses a large collection of films on videotape which is of particular interest to students and faculty in the public history program. The collection is particularly strong in documentaries on labor history and the immigrant experience, African-American history, and other aspects of twentieth-century social history.   Current priorities in collection efforts are:     acquisition of multiple copies of works in heavy demand, with special attention to women's history and African-American history;   strengthening of the collection in history of the American South through retrospective purchases   selective retrospective purchases on the American discovery/exploration, and Colonial, periods   selective retrospective purchases on history of the American West   continued purchase of materials in support of the department's archival management track.                   Other Resources     Related Collections within NYU Libraries   The Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives/Tamiment Collection is a major resource for the study of United States labor and oral history and radical movements of the 20th century. The Tamiment Collection provides extensive primary materials in the form  of organizational and personal records. In addition, Tamiment collects microforms in labor and union history which fall outside the scope of the general collections. Tamiment also provides a secure copy of many older or heavily-used titles no longer  available in the stacks. The NYU Law library is a fine resource for American legal and constitutional history.   Other Collections in New York City   New York Public Library, 42nd Street Research Library has extensive monograph and serial holdings in United States and Canadian history from all periods. In particular, the United States History, Local History, and Genealogy Division offers a  extremely rich and diverse resources in local and genealogical history. The General Research Division is home to an important collection of retrospective newspapers and periodicals. The New York Public Library, Schomburg Center has extensive holdings  (both primary and secondary) in African-American history and culture. The New York Historical Society has extensive holdings in regional, state, and local history. Union and General Theological Seminary libraries have strong holdings in the religious  history of America.

CLACS has a consortial arrangement with Columbia University's Institute for Iberian and Latin American Studies     which includes the cross-registration of students, joint summer institutes and joint public events.    The Center integrates the resources of New York University for the study of inter-American affairs, stressing the study of contemporary relations--    the emerging social, cultural, economic, and political links between and among the Americas.    The future priorities of CLACS include strengthening and expanding programs in Caribbean Studies, and the development of closer ties with the professional schools.            The collection also supports Latin American and Caribbean area studies course concentrations for doctoral programs in anthropology, cinema studies,     comparative literature, business administration, economics, history, politics, sociology, and Spanish and Portuguese languages and literatures.            Increasingly, in recent years, the collection has developed in response to the needs of issue based, inter-disciplinary studies and closer interaction between CLACS and the professional schools.    Issue based structures within FAS and/or GSAS include departments or programs in Africana Studies, Ethnographic Film and Video, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Metropolitan Studies, Peace and Global Policy Studies, and Women's Studies.    Recent global issues attracting cross-disciplinary interest and transnational perspectives include cultural studies, human rights, urban life, migration studies, environmental studies, post-colonial studies and communication studies.    Several Centers will be the focus of significant future, on-campus trends in cross-disciplinary research and teaching:    1) The King Juan Carlos I Center for the Study of Spain and the Spanish-speaking world ;    2) the Center for Media, Culture, and History; and    3) the NYU Institutes for Advanced International Studies.        Departmental interests are as follows:               History           Latin American and Caribbean history from 1492 to the present.     All countries are of interest for historical research and course work; emphasis has, historically been on Brazil and the Caribbean.     Recent interests include the Andean region and the African Diaspora.                    Politics           Political institutions, development, reform, revolution; U.S. corporate and governmental policy; common markets and collective trading groups;     urban politics; Latin American and Caribbean migration to the U.S. and Western Europe, and communities of Latin American and Caribbean nationals in the U.S. and Western Europe;     emphasis is on the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico.

Performance Studies      Theater, dance, celebration, ritual and popular entertainment, including for example cricket, carnival, soccer, feminist theater projects, calypso, cockfighting, soap opera, comics, cuisine, voodoo, and political campaigns.                Sociology           Structure and dynamics of contemporary Latin American societies, covering sociological theory (major Latin American theorists, themes and debates);     power and inequality (social stratification, gender relations, race relations, social movements, and political sociology);     social institutions (kinship, class, political parties, church, schools, the army, family, labor organizations etc.);     and social groups (women, blacks, immigrants, children, indigenous groups, elite groups, peasant groups, etc.)                    Music      Performance practice; music industry; music history, biography, and criticism; popular song and dance music (tango, rumba, reggae, samba, tropicalia, zouk, etc.)                    Fine Arts           Pre-Columbian art and archeology; material culture and folk art; major artists and museums; reproductions of historically significant prints and photographs;     aesthetics of cities; public policy; art history; and, art exhibit catalogs.                    Comparative Literature      In addition to Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures (see separate collection development statement), non-hispanic Caribbean diasporic authors, literary criticism, literary movements, and cultural studies.                          Scope               Language           Materials are acquired in Spanish, English, Portuguese, and, more selectively, French, German and Dutch.     Codices, grammars, etc. of indigenous languages are acquired very selectively.     English translations of titles in languages not collected are acquired when available and of scholarly interest.                    Geographical Areas           All countries of Latin America and the Caribbean region are covered, although research trends and political events intensify collection effort for particular countries or regions at given times.     Geographical areas emphasized are Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Central America.     Latin American and Caribbean communities in the United States and Western Europe are of interest for migration and ethnic studies;     emphasis is on the Caribbean diaspora.                    Chronological Periods           Emphasis is on all historical periods from European conquest to the present.     The pre-Columbian period is of more limited interest in the Departments of Anthropology and History, and resources covering this period are acquired more selectively.                              Types of Materials               Included           Monographs, monographic series, serials, proceedings, facsimiles, microforms, videos, music recordings, electronic media, multi-media, and Internet resources.     Government documents, atlases, dissertations, scores, working papers, pamphlets, and ephemera are acquired on a more selective basis.                    Excluded      Maps, textbooks and juvenilia.                          Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Collection development for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses primarily on the history, politics, international relations, social and economic conditions, literatures and languages of Latin America and the Caribbean. Historically, the strengths of the collection are literature and the political, economic and social history of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Collecting is stronger in the humanities than in the social sciences.    The collection coverage for individual authors, literary criticism and literary movements is very good. The contemporary Brazilian fiction and poetry collection is noteworthy and serves as a resource for scholars throughout the metropolitan area. The collection in Caribbean history and literature, all language areas and the diaspora is steadily becoming a noteworthy collection. The audio-visual collection is nationally unique. Areas of relatively recent scholarly interest at NYU are currently being developed and strengthened: art, music, business, popular culture, migration studies, environmental studies and women's studies.    In 1982, the library started to implement blanket order acquisition plans with Latin American vendors. These plans currently cover Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Central America, Mexico, and the British Caribbean. Under the terms of these plans current imprints from various Latin American countries are automatically received at Bobst Library. These agreements have dramatically improved the coverage and timeliness of current imprints. The blanket order shipments are considerably augmented by firm orders generated by dealers' catalogs, publishers' catalogs, library acquistions' lists, bibliographies and review media.    The Business and Social Science/Documents Center hold many important resources for social science research on Latin America and the Caribbean. The United Nations and International Governmental Organizations Collection receives on deposit or standing order, the publications of the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America, the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labor Office and the International Council for Migration. Most of these government documents do not appear in BobCat. The Center also has extensive microform collections covering historical and current socio-economic statistics.    The library offers a wide range of electronic resources, including remote and in-library access to the the Hispanic American Periodicals Index (HAPI), LADB (Latin American Database) and the Handbook of Latin American Studies (HLAS). The Library offers a wide range of commercial databases which contain Latin American information, including PAIS, the MLA Bibliography, F&amp;S International, Ethnic Newswatch, and Dissertation Abstracts. The Library also has a Latin American Studies Resources Homepage . Multi-media, electronic text and electronic data on CD-ROM are collected very selectively. and, strategically, Since January 1993, the library has offered the academic community Latin American newsbroadcasts via satellite through SCOLA. SCOLA programming is available for viewing in the library as well as at other locations around the University where NYU-TV broadcasting is available. SCOLA programs may be recorded off-air for use in classrooms or by individual researchers.    Some of the collection weaknesses are as follows:        government publications, except for population census material and statistical abstracts. The library relies on holdings at New York Public Library and LAMP . This will not change unless we agree to cooperate regionally.        serials in general. There are historical gaps in history and literature which are impossible to fill, unless microform copies can be identified for purchase. Current subscriptiohns have been added on a very selective basis for the past ten years due to budgetary constraints.        current news sources. The cost and difficulty of acquiring and processing newspapers and newsmagazines have resulted in limited holdings. In addition to the limited holdings the library relies on newspaper clipping services, the Latin American Newsletters, Global Newsbank, LADB, FBIS, and SCOLA. The library is currently working on a regional cooperative collecting agreement.        Newspaper backfiles. The library currently relies on news clipping services, FBIS, regional holdings, CRL and LAMP . The library is considering adding a limited number of backfiles based on regional gaps, and cooperative collection agreements. So far the library has added Uno m&aacute;s Uno.        current social and economic statistics. The library relies on the statistical publications of international organizations and a selection of Latin American statistical publications available on microform. The statistics are reported in these sources with two to three delays. The library may need to consider adding a selection of statistical abstracts in paper.        preservation problems have contributed to the gaps in the library's Latin American collection. New titles from Latin America and the Caribbean are printed on poor quality paper which does not withstand heavy use and aging. The library is addressing the problem by routinely binding new material, and replacing brittle material with microfilm copy.        Pre-1950 imprints. Retrospective collection assessment and development is a constant necessity to identify and, if possible fill lacunae. Important retrospective material is often reprinted, re-published in new editions, or microfilmed. It is very difficult, and, usually too costly to purchase and preserve original editions.                     Resource Sharing      Numerous and complex factors such as the proliferation of research materials, lack of sufficient acquisitions funds and the physical deterioration of large portions of the collection have forced research libraries to recognize their inability to be entirely self-sufficient, and the need to rely on cooperative collection development and user referrals to other collections. Coordinated resource sharing makes it possible to offer Latin American scholars in the region, and specifically at New York University, a wider range of research material.     The logical and most important coordinating partner is Columbia University Libraries. In 1988 the two institutions established a Consortium for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, which has stimulated frequent contact between the bibliographers to coordinate, among other things, respective collection development policies. The two bibliographers actively develop collaborative projects that will increase the breadth and depth of Latin American holdings in the New York metropolitan area. Examples of formal agreements include sharing coverage of Latin American and Caribbean 2nd tier women writers; migrant communities in Europe; and Latin American Recorded Popular Music. Major purchasing, such as the recent acquisition of the  Author Catalogues of the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid  and the  Archivo Biogr&aacute;fico de Espa&ntilde;a, Portugal e Iberoam&eacute;rica,  is done collaboratively.     As participating member of the  Latin American Northeast Library Consortium (LANE)  , the Latin American Bibliographer meets with colleagues in the Northeast twice a year to discuss collection development issues. The other participating bibliographers are from NYPL, Columbia Univ. Rutgers Univ., Univ. Of Connecticut at Storrs, Univ. Of Mass., Univ. Of Pittsburg, Princeton Univ., Univ. of Pennsylvannia, Yale Univ., Brown Univ., Cornell Univ., and Harvard Univ. LANE is currently planning to coordinate, jointly identify and/or broaden the coverage of 1) current newspaper and newsweekly subscriptions; 2) historical backfiles of newspapers and newsweeklies; 3) financial statistical sources; 4) videos from and/or about Latin America; 5) business news sources; 6) telephone books; and 7) major microform sets.     The LANE group complements and extends the work of the Latin American Microform Project (LAMP) , of which Bobst Library is a subscribing member. LAMP was founded in 1975 for the purpose of making available to scholars Latin American research materials in microformat, which would otherwise be unavailable. This includes materials which are inaccessible, in poor condition, or beyond the economic means of an individual institution. There are currently 33 member libraries, all of which have borrowing privileges for LAMP material housed at CRL's facilities. A meeting to report on projects-in-progress and to propose new projects is held once a year at SALALM .     Bobst Library's membership in the Center for Research Librarires is crucial for access to foreign dissertations; newspaper backfiles; British Foreign Office Microform Sets; and State Dept. Microform Sets.     The Library is a participant in the Latin American Demonstration Project of the AAU/ARL Global Resources Program together with 34 other libraries. Our participation requires 1) a commitment to provide access to selected Mexican and Argentine journals by maintaining subscriptions, providing timely ILL, and supplying contents pages for a journal database; and 2) A $7,000 comitment to Latin American Art Exhibit Catalogs.

The Department of History offers graduate study in United States history from the colonial settlement to the present. Departmental emphases are in political, urban, social, labor, and intellectual history, from the Civil War to the present. In addition, the department offers two New York state certificate programs, which may be taken in conjunction with the masters or doctoral degree: public history and archival management/historical editing. Concentrations in women's history and African- American history are also available at the master's and doctoral level.   The History Department has close ties to the Program in Metropolitan Studies, an undergraduate sequence focusing on urban culture and policy, and the Program in American Studies, which offers an interdisciplinary approach to modern American culture leading to the master's and doctoral degree. Courses given in the latter program also rely heavily on the collections in cinema, literature, anthropology, and the performing arts.   The collection also supports teaching and research in the following departments, programs, and divisions: Politics, English, Sociology, Africana Studies, Museum Studies, the Gallatin School, the School of Education, and the School of Continuing Education.                 Scope       Language   The collection consists primarily of materials in English. Selection of materials in European languages is highly selective.       Geographical Areas   Emphasis is on the history of the United States, and to a lesser extent the history of Canada. Within the United States, coverage is extensive for New England and the Middle Atlantic States, with particular strengths in the history of New York  City and New York State. Materials on the South are less well-developed; those on the West (west of the Mississippi River) are not collected intensively.       Chronological Periods   The collection includes primary and secondary sources for all periods, from prehistory and early discovery through the Colonial period, nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the present. In keeping with departmental focus, coverage is generally  more extensive for the period from the Civil War to the present, with strong holdings for the twentieth century.                     Types of Materials       Included   Monographs, monographic series, facsimiles, reprints, atlases, conference proceedings, newspapers, journals, microforms, book catalogs of major historical collections and exhibitions, video recordings, CD-ROMS, and electronic texts.       Excluded   Textbooks, manuals, maps, manuscripts, pamphlets, newsletters, and juvenile and popular materials.   Genealogical materials such as birth and death records are not collected, with the exception of certain genealogical reference materials (primarily dictionaries of names) held in General and Humanities Reference. Immigrant records (passenger  lists, registers of birth) are not collected beyond basic bibliographies.                     Strengths &amp; Weaknesses   Based on assessment of the stack collections in LC classes E and F1 - F1200, the general strengths of the collection are in social and political history from the Civil War to the present. For this era both primary and secondary sources are well represented. Highlights are African-American history, women's history; history of New York City and state, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region. (See Section VI for subject and collecting levels.)   Less well represented are primary and secondary sources on the discovery of America and early exploration, the Colonial period, and the American South.   It should be noted that additional materials of interest to historians are located in other LC classes, including JK 1-1600 (politics and government of the United States), HQ (Family, Marriage, Woman), HT (Communities, Classes, Races), and HN (Social History).   In addition, stack materials in all of the above LC classes are complemented and extended by numerous microform sets. These sets are are an important addition to the retrospective book and serial collection and provide access to numerous primary sources. These sets include:     Early American Imprints I and II   Early American Newspapers   Early American Periodicals   Gerritsen Collection of Women's History   State Secession Debates, 1859-1862   State Slavery Statutes   Slavery in Ante-Bellum Southern Industries   American Immigrant Autobiographies   Voices from Ellis Island   Emma Goldman Papers   Papers of W.E.B DuBois   Papers of Margaret Sanger   Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony     Beginning with the early twentieth century, the Government Documents collection in the Social Science Reference Center is an important resource, with collections of Congressional hearings.   The Avery Fisher Center houses a large collection of films on videotape which is of particular interest to students and faculty in the public history program. The collection is particularly strong in documentaries on labor history and the immigrant experience, African-American history, and other aspects of twentieth-century social history.   Current priorities in collection efforts are:     acquisition of multiple copies of works in heavy demand, with special attention to women's history and African-American history;   strengthening of the collection in history of the American South through retrospective purchases   selective retrospective purchases on the American discovery/exploration, and Colonial, periods   selective retrospective purchases on history of the American West   continued purchase of materials in support of the department's archival management track.                   Other Resources     Related Collections within NYU Libraries   The Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives/Tamiment Collection is a major resource for the study of United States labor and oral history and radical movements of the 20th century. The Tamiment Collection provides extensive primary materials in the form  of organizational and personal records. In addition, Tamiment collects microforms in labor and union history which fall outside the scope of the general collections. Tamiment also provides a secure copy of many older or heavily-used titles no longer  available in the stacks. The NYU Law library is a fine resource for American legal and constitutional history.   Other Collections in New York City   New York Public Library, 42nd Street Research Library has extensive monograph and serial holdings in United States and Canadian history from all periods. In particular, the United States History, Local History, and Genealogy Division offers a  extremely rich and diverse resources in local and genealogical history. The General Research Division is home to an important collection of retrospective newspapers and periodicals. The New York Public Library, Schomburg Center has extensive holdings  (both primary and secondary) in African-American history and culture.

CLACS has a consortial arrangement with Columbia University's Institute for Iberian and Latin American Studies     which includes the cross-registration of students, joint summer institutes and joint public events.    The Center integrates the resources of New York University for the study of inter-American affairs, stressing the study of contemporary relations--    the emerging social, cultural, economic, and political links between and among the Americas.    The future priorities of CLACS include strengthening and expanding programs in Caribbean Studies, and the development of closer ties with the professional schools.            The collection also supports Latin American and Caribbean area studies course concentrations for doctoral programs in anthropology, cinema studies,     comparative literature, business administration, economics, history, politics, sociology, and Spanish and Portuguese languages and literatures.            Increasingly, in recent years, the collection has developed in response to the needs of issue based, inter-disciplinary studies and closer interaction between CLACS and the professional schools.    Issue based structures within FAS and/or GSAS include departments or programs in Africana Studies, Ethnographic Film and Video, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Metropolitan Studies, Peace and Global Policy Studies, and Women's Studies.    Recent global issues attracting cross-disciplinary interest and transnational perspectives include cultural studies, human rights, urban life, migration studies, environmental studies, post-colonial studies and communication studies.    Several Centers will be the focus of significant future, on-campus trends in cross-disciplinary research and teaching:    1) The King Juan Carlos I Center for the Study of Spain and the Spanish-speaking world ;    2) the Center for Media, Culture, and History; and    3) the NYU Institutes for Advanced International Studies.        Departmental interests are as follows:               History           Latin American and Caribbean history from 1492 to the present.     All countries are of interest for historical research and course work; emphasis has, historically been on Brazil and the Caribbean.     Recent interests include the Andean region and the African Diaspora.                    Politics           Political institutions, development, reform, revolution; U.S. corporate and governmental policy; common markets and collective trading groups;     urban politics; Latin American and Caribbean migration to the U.S. and Western Europe, and communities of Latin American and Caribbean nationals in the U.S. and Western Europe;     emphasis is on the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico.                    Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures      (See separate collection development statement) - Spanish-American and Brazilian authors, literary criticism, literary movements, and Latin American civilization.                Linguistics      Urban Hispanic and/or Afro-Latin American diasporic sociolinguistic varieties, bilingualism, indigenous and creole languages.                Economics      Urban economics, international trade and finance, the political economy of north-south relations, Latin American economic theory, theoretical studies on economic development in Latin America.                Business      Finance, management and organizational behavior, and marketing, supporting practical research on the Latin American debt, emerging markets, financial markets, investment analysis, political risk, the business culture, consumer behavior and environmental resource management.                Anthropology      Pre- and post-Conquest political, social and cultural anthropology of Latin America and the Caribbean, migration studies, gender studies, Caribbean linguistic anthropology, urban anthropology, and ethnographic film and video.                Cinema Studies      History of national cinemas, filmmakers, ethnographic film and video, documentary film and video, film and television industries, and film criticism; the emphasis is on Cuba, Mexico, and Brazil.                Performance Studies      Theater, dance, celebration, ritual and popular entertainment, including for example cricket, carnival, soccer, feminist theater projects, calypso, cockfighting, soap opera, comics, cuisine, voodoo, and political campaigns.                Sociology           Structure and dynamics of contemporary Latin American societies, covering sociological theory (major Latin American theorists, themes and debates);     power and inequality (social stratification, gender relations, race relations, social movements, and political sociology);     social institutions (kinship, class, political parties, church, schools, the army, family, labor organizations etc.);     and social groups (women, blacks, immigrants, children, indigenous groups, elite groups, peasant groups, etc.)                    Music      Performance practice; music industry; music history, biography, and criticism; popular song and dance music (tango, rumba, reggae, samba, tropicalia, zouk, etc.)                    Fine Arts           Pre-Columbian art and archeology; material culture and folk art; major artists and museums; reproductions of historically significant prints and photographs;     aesthetics of cities; public policy; art history; and, art exhibit catalogs.                    Comparative Literature      In addition to Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures (see separate collection development statement), non-hispanic Caribbean diasporic authors, literary criticism, literary movements, and cultural studies.                          Scope               Language           Materials are acquired in Spanish, English, Portuguese, and, more selectively, French, German and Dutch.     Codices, grammars, etc. of indigenous languages are acquired very selectively.     English translations of titles in languages not collected are acquired when available and of scholarly interest.                    Geographical Areas           All countries of Latin America and the Caribbean region are covered, although research trends and political events intensify collection effort for particular countries or regions at given times.     Geographical areas emphasized are Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Central America.     Latin American and Caribbean communities in the United States and Western Europe are of interest for migration and ethnic studies;     emphasis is on the Caribbean diaspora.                    Chronological Periods           Emphasis is on all historical periods from European conquest to the present.     The pre-Columbian period is of more limited interest in the Departments of Anthropology and History, and resources covering this period are acquired more selectively.                              Types of Materials               Included           Monographs, monographic series, serials, proceedings, facsimiles, microforms, videos, music recordings, electronic media, multi-media, and Internet resources.     Government documents, atlases, dissertations, scores, working papers, pamphlets, and ephemera are acquired on a more selective basis.                    Excluded      Maps, textbooks and juvenilia.                          Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Collection development for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses primarily on the history, politics, international relations, social and economic conditions, literatures and languages of Latin America and the Caribbean. Historically, the strengths of the collection are literature and the political, economic and social history of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Collecting is stronger in the humanities than in the social sciences.    The collection coverage for individual authors, literary criticism and literary movements is very good. The contemporary Brazilian fiction and poetry collection is noteworthy and serves as a resource for scholars throughout the metropolitan area. The collection in Caribbean history and literature, all language areas and the diaspora is steadily becoming a noteworthy collection. The audio-visual collection is nationally unique. Areas of relatively recent scholarly interest at NYU are currently being developed and strengthened: art, music, business, popular culture, migration studies, environmental studies and women's studies.    In 1982, the library started to implement blanket order acquisition plans with Latin American vendors. These plans currently cover Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Central America, Mexico, and the British Caribbean. Under the terms of these plans current imprints from various Latin American countries are automatically received at Bobst Library. These agreements have dramatically improved the coverage and timeliness of current imprints. The blanket order shipments are considerably augmented by firm orders generated by dealers' catalogs, publishers' catalogs, library acquistions' lists, bibliographies and review media.    The Business and Social Science/Documents Center hold many important resources for social science research on Latin America and the Caribbean. The United Nations and International Governmental Organizations Collection receives on deposit or standing order, the publications of the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America, the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labor Office and the International Council for Migration. Most of these government documents do not appear in BobCat. The Center also has extensive microform collections covering historical and current socio-economic statistics.    The library offers a wide range of electronic resources, including remote and in-library access to the the Hispanic American Periodicals Index (HAPI), LADB (Latin American Database) and the Handbook of Latin American Studies (HLAS). The Library offers a wide range of commercial databases which contain Latin American information, including PAIS, the MLA Bibliography, F&amp;S International, Ethnic Newswatch, and Dissertation Abstracts. The Library also has a Latin American Studies Resources Homepage . Multi-media, electronic text and electronic data on CD-ROM are collected very selectively. and, strategically, Since January 1993, the library has offered the academic community Latin American newsbroadcasts via satellite through SCOLA. SCOLA programming is available for viewing in the library as well as at other locations around the University where NYU-TV broadcasting is available. SCOLA programs may be recorded off-air for use in classrooms or by individual researchers.    Some of the collection weaknesses are as follows:        government publications, except for population census material and statistical abstracts. The library relies on holdings at New York Public Library and LAMP . This will not change unless we agree to cooperate regionally.        serials in general. There are historical gaps in history and literature which are impossible to fill, unless microform copies can be identified for purchase. Current subscriptiohns have been added on a very selective basis for the past ten years due to budgetary constraints.        current news sources. The cost and difficulty of acquiring and processing newspapers and newsmagazines have resulted in limited holdings. In addition to the limited holdings the library relies on newspaper clipping services, the Latin American Newsletters, Global Newsbank, LADB, FBIS, and SCOLA. The library is currently working on a regional cooperative collecting agreement.        Newspaper backfiles. The library currently relies on news clipping services, FBIS, regional holdings, CRL and LAMP . The library is considering adding a limited number of backfiles based on regional gaps, and cooperative collection agreements. So far the library has added Uno m&aacute;s Uno.        current social and economic statistics. The library relies on the statistical publications of international organizations and a selection of Latin American statistical publications available on microform. The statistics are reported in these sources with two to three delays. The library may need to consider adding a selection of statistical abstracts in paper.        preservation problems have contributed to the gaps in the library's Latin American collection. New titles from Latin America and the Caribbean are printed on poor quality paper which does not withstand heavy use and aging. The library is addressing the problem by routinely binding new material, and replacing brittle material with microfilm copy.        Pre-1950 imprints. Retrospective collection assessment and development is a constant necessity to identify and, if possible fill lacunae. Important retrospective material is often reprinted, re-published in new editions, or microfilmed. It is very difficult, and, usually too costly to purchase and preserve original editions.                     Resource Sharing      Numerous and complex factors such as the proliferation of research materials, lack of sufficient acquisitions funds and the physical deterioration of large portions of the collection have forced research libraries to recognize their inability to be entirely self-sufficient, and the need to rely on cooperative collection development and user referrals to other collections. Coordinated resource sharing makes it possible to offer Latin American scholars in the region, and specifically at New York University, a wider range of research material.     The logical and most important coordinating partner is Columbia University Libraries. In 1988 the two institutions established a Consortium for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, which has stimulated frequent contact between the bibliographers to coordinate, among other things, respective collection development policies. The two bibliographers actively develop collaborative projects that will increase the breadth and depth of Latin American holdings in the New York metropolitan area. Examples of formal agreements include sharing coverage of Latin American and Caribbean 2nd tier women writers; migrant communities in Europe; and Latin American Recorded Popular Music. Major purchasing, such as the recent acquisition of the  Author Catalogues of the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid  and the  Archivo Biogr&aacute;fico de Espa&ntilde;a, Portugal e Iberoam&eacute;rica,  is done collaboratively.     As participating member of the  Latin American Northeast Library Consortium (LANE)  , the Latin American Bibliographer meets with colleagues in the Northeast twice a year to discuss collection development issues. The other participating bibliographers are from NYPL, Columbia Univ. Rutgers Univ., Univ. Of Connecticut at Storrs, Univ. Of Mass., Univ. Of Pittsburg, Princeton Univ., Univ. of Pennsylvannia, Yale Univ., Brown Univ., Cornell Univ., and Harvard Univ. LANE is currently planning to coordinate, jointly identify and/or broaden the coverage of 1) current newspaper and newsweekly subscriptions; 2) historical backfiles of newspapers and newsweeklies; 3) financial statistical sources; 4) videos from and/or about Latin America; 5) business news sources; 6) telephone books; and 7) major microform sets.     The LANE group complements and extends the work of the Latin American Microform Project (LAMP) , of which Bobst Library is a subscribing member. LAMP was founded in 1975 for the purpose of making available to scholars Latin American research materials in microformat, which would otherwise be unavailable. This includes materials which are inaccessible, in poor condition, or beyond the economic means of an individual institution. There are currently 33 member libraries, all of which have borrowing privileges for LAMP material housed at CRL's facilities. A meeting to report on projects-in-progress and to propose new projects is held once a year at SALALM .     Bobst Library's membership in the Center for Research Librarires is crucial for access to foreign dissertations; newspaper backfiles; British Foreign Office Microform Sets; and State Dept. Microform Sets.     The Library is a participant in the Latin American Demonstration Project of the AAU/ARL Global Resources Program together with 34 other libraries. Our participation requires 1) a commitment to provide access to selected Mexican and Argentine journals by maintaining subscriptions, providing timely ILL, and supplying contents pages for a journal database; and 2) A $7,000 comitment to Latin American Art Exhibit Catalogs.
