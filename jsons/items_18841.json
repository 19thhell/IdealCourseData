This course is also appropriate for trainees in these areas.                                                   Course Purpose                                                                         NYU's 2015 Advanced Imaging of Joints with an Emphasis on Sports Injuries offers a comprehensive and intensive 3-day program in musculoskeletal radiology. There has been tremendous growth in the field of radiology and in the area of musculoskeletal imaging in particular, making it mandatory for radiologists, both in academic and private practice settings, to continually update their skills and complement their knowledge base. Maintenance of certification also requires radiologists to stay current with new advances in the field. With the growth of radiology and the increasing importance it plays both in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in the musculoskeletal system, it has also become imperative for practicing orthopedists and practitioners of physical medicine and rehabilitation to have a basic understanding of imaging and how it can best be used in service of the patient.                                                   Course Description                                                                         This conference will offer a unique and innovative program in sports related injuries which is organized by body part and includes a review of relevant anatomy in each area. There will be instructional videos of actual arthroscopic procedures of the knee and shoulder with live review of the findings by the orthopedists and discussion of the correlative imaging by a radiologist. A discussion of relevant sports related pathology will then ensue. All of the major joints will be covered in this comprehensive fashion. Other current and relevant topics to be covered will include cartilage repair techniques and their appearance on imaging, imaging athletic pubalgia, common sports specific injuries, nerve entrapment syndromes and musculoskeletal ultrasound. Additional topics to be covered outside of the realm of sports related pathology will include imaging of soft tissue and bone tumors, proper technique for tumor biopsy and MR imaging of rheumatoid arthritis.  Read with the Experts 2015  Enrollment limited to 50 attendees! This workshop will allow the participant to read cases alongside some of the best musculoskeletal radiologists in the world. We will present challenging cases and will guide registrants through this hands-on and interactive session. Registrants will review approximately 50 cases under the supervision of these expert speakers. This intensive session will focus on developing a systematic approach to the interpretation of normal anatomy and pathology of various joints, with an emphasis on common manifestations and patterns of sports related injury. The participants will have an opportunity to see how experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, all leaders in the field, approach the cases.
