This course presents students with an   opportunity to learn about and connect with information technology and   micro-power projects in East Africa. The goal of this course is to link   creative designers and thinkers (i.e., ITP students) with real people   who have real needs. The instructor \u201cintroduces\u201d the students to a   number of East African residents who have a range of communication and   power consumption requirements. For example, Rose is a mother of eight   children (four of her own and four orphaned and left with her) who   operates a community-based organization (CBO). How can she stay in touch   with her community without electricity to charge her cell phone? Dr.   Richard, a traditional healer and tinkerer who holds a PhD from a   university in London,   has returned to Kenya practice medicine in his village and would like   help developing a solar-powered drip irrigation system for medicinal   plants for the increasingly long and frequent dry seasons. Gomba, an   artist living in the Kibera slum, only has illegal and dangerous access   to electricity in his studio. How can he create inexpensive safe   lighting? TICAH (Trust for Indigenous Culture and Health), a Kenyan non-   governmental organization (NGO), would like to develop an inexpensive   text messaging  system for people to send in stories of foods eaten that help boost   immunity as well as to manage specific health problems.  This is a lab course that covers theories and technologies specific to   the developing world. The instructor shares lessons from case studies of   projects, organizations and people in Kenya whilst guiding students to   develop their own prototype of a practical application for real people   located in both rural and urban East Africa. The course also introduces   students to development theory, particularly the idea of expanding   human rights, capabilities and freedoms. Such ideas are shaping   international development; they are relevant for thinking about how to   design and distribute innovative, suitable, and desirable products and   services for low-income people around the world. We meet these ideas   through readings and case studies of institutions practicing such ideas   from the global to the grassroots level. ITP students will collaborate   with people at the \"bottom of the pyramid\" to address a specific need.
