Students and instructors should  review  scripts and identify locations or set-ups that jeopardize or restrict  insurance coverage for the production. Also, coverage will not be  granted to locations where the general public is denied access due to  inherent risk (i.e. condemned property, airport runways, etc.). Here  are some common items/activities that must be cleared before approval can be granted: Aircraft Animals Bridges, Tunnels Cranes, Lifts, Jibs International Shoots Large Generators Simulated Firearms &amp; Weapons Picture Cars Pyrotechnics Rooftops, Fire Escapes, Balconies Trains, Subways, Railroad Locations Water, Watercraft   Projects involving any of the items listed above must be discussed  in detail with the instructor. A full scene description and accompanying details  must also be filed via the 'Special Insurance Request' section of the  NYU Insurance web site: www.nyu.edu/insurance. Please note that this  process takes a minimum of two weeks to complete, so please plan  accordingly.     Policy On Insuring Production Vehicles, Picture Cars, Camera Cars, Process Trailers, and Moving Car Shots (Updated 7/21/2010) The University does not provide insurance for vehicles used on or in connection with student film productions, except when a vehicle is only being used as a stationary (non-moving) prop or background vehicles in the scene. Students who intend to use vehicles in film production that include but are not limited to personal cars, passenger vans, cargo vans, grip trucks, tracking vehicles, picture cars or moving car shots must satisfy the University's insurance and safety criteria, by adhering to the following: All vehicles used for the production (including personal cars and any vehicles carrying cast or crew) must carry a minimum of $1,000,000 in general liability insurance coverage. For rentals, a minimum of $1,000,000 in general liability insurance must be purchased from the rental company. The extra liability coverage is available from most rental companies and is called \u201cadditional or supplemental insurance.\u201d Copies of rental reservation(s) will be required by the NYU Department of Insurance and Risk Management, with proof of the liability coverage attached. For personal cars, a copy of the owner's auto insurance policy must be provided, reflecting proof of the $1,000,000 coverage. If the existing coverage on the vehicle does not meet this requirement, then you will have to contact the auto insurance provider to purchase an additional 'umbrella' policy with a minimum of of $1,000,000 in order to meet the requirements. Such policies vary, so please contact the auto insurance provider for more information. In compliance with safety regulations, a passenger van may be used as long as its capacity does not exceed 12 persons. Insurance information for all vehicles must be submitted to the NYU Department of Insurance and Risk Management as soon as the vehicle(s) have been secured.      Policy on use of Pictures Cars &amp; Moving Car Shots (Updated 7/21/2010)       This section refers to any vehicle, moving or non-moving, being depicted in the film frame or any vehicles associated with moving the camera, including but not limited to: Camera Cars, Shot Makers, lowboys, trailers, and flat beds. All students will be required to provide complete documentation and disclosure of any use of picture cars and any and all moving vehicles ($1,000,000 liability insurance requirements are compulsory).  Graduate students will be allowed to use picture cars with proper vetting by the Graduate faculty. Undergraduate Advanced-Level students will be allowed to use picture cars with proper vetting by the Instructor and the Production Supervision Committee. In order for the shot to be approved by the Supervision Committee, productions will be required in most cases to close off streets and secure permission/supervision from the local authorities where filming. Other rules may apply depending upon the circumstance. Students who have had their request approved will be required to have a final pre-production meeting with a faculty member from the Cinematography Area so that all production safety concerns can be addressed. Undergraduate Freshmen, Sophomore, Fundamentals, and Intermediate-level projects are not permitted to feature moving car shots. The following guidelines must be adhered to in order for a moving car shot to be approved for all student projects, Graduate and Undergraduate: There  are NO hood mounts, tray mounts or suction cup mounts allowed on any moving vehicle. Shooting From The Passenger Seat: Will be approved under limited circumstances, with proper vetting by the instructor, production supervisor(s), and Risk Management and the following must apply: a) Police supervision b) Street closing on either end c) Proof of $1,000,000 liability coverage on the vehicle. When actor does not need to be featured in the shot, a designated driver (licensed crew member) must drive the vehicle. Shooting From The Back Seat: Will be approved under limited circumstances, with proper vetting by the instructor, production supervisor(s), and Risk Management and the following must apply: a) Police supervision b) Street closing on either end c) Proof of $1,000,000 liability coverage on the vehicle. When the actor does not need to be featured in the shot, a designated driver (licensed crew member) must drive the vehicle. 'Poor Man's Process': Will be insured with proper approval by the instructor and production supervisor(s). This process allows for the simulation of a moving car shot with the use of lighting effects and minimal to no movement of the vehicle itself. Traveling Shots: Unless  the traveling shot is a tow with a properly equipped camera car, most  lights are not allowed for daytime shooting. Kinoflo\u2019s are negotiable. For  night shooting, small plug-in (6 volt cigarette lighter) lights are  allowed For all circumstances: You  must supply a plan of how many people will be in the car in terms of cast  and crew. All vehicles must  have assigned drivers. Photocopies of their drivers\u2019 licenses will be  required. All  picture car shots on New York City streets must be cleared with the  Mayor\u2019s Office. Moving car  routes must be mapped out and approved by both the Mayor\u2019s Office and the  NYPD Movie &amp; TV Unit. Shoots  taking place on any public streets outside of NYC require local police  presence and the ability to close off streets. Film &amp; TV and the Department of Insurance &amp;  Risk Management will require copies of all permits and permissions which  must be granted by the local authorities. Filming on any roadway or street without these  requirements is strictly prohibited.  Please note that the Department of Film &amp; TV reserves the right to change, alter, or modify these guidelines at any time, to comply with changes in the curriculum as well as changes to standard procedures set forth by the NYU Department of Insurance &amp; Risk Management                          Subway Scenes There is NO insurance coverage for shoots within 50 feet of subway platforms, tracks, or moving trains. No exceptions! If you would like to shoot  near the entrance of or by the turnstile of a subway station you must  contact the MTA Office of Film &amp; Special Events (646) 252-5853, or  visit them online: www.mta.info/nyct/sub_filming/filming.htm . Keep  in mind that the MTA charges a substantial fee for subway shoots and  does not offer any student discounts or waivers. You must contact  them at the number given above for further details. An  alternative to shooting on or in the subway is the New York Transit  Museum. However, they al so charge a fee of approximately $1000.00 for  every 6 hours of shooting (subject to change). You must contact them  Transit Museum for further details, (718) 243-3060 Other Subway &amp; Railroad Locations Other railroad locations may be available, but you must do a thorough scout and make contact with the office in charge of granting permission for you to film at that location. If permission can be granted, you must submit the proper insured's information on an insurance request form, along with details about the location and the scene you plan to shoot. Please note that the maximum two-week turnaround is needed to process your request, and additional fees for special railroad coverage may be required.
