Current News/Projects                            Updated August 2014 I am an evolutionary morphologist and paleoanthropologist with   primary research interests in the evolution of positional behavior   (posture and locomotion) during human evolution. My research focus is   not on a particular time period; rather, I am   interested in evolutionary transitions in the hominoid fossil record,   from 20 million-year-old extinct apes to modern human and ape variation   and the entirety of human evolution in between. The major focus of my   academic work has been on the primate postcranial skeleton and   specifically the vertebral column (spine). I have worked to describe and   analyze in a large comparative dataset the vertebral column of a new   species of early hominin, Australopithecus sediba . Late last   year, I was part of a team that excavated and cataloged a large number   of hominin fossils at Rising Star Cave in the Cradle of Humankind, South   Africa. I worked with an international team of researchers this summer   to describe what is likely a new and surprising species of hominin that   will undoubtedly alter the way we think about human evolution.      I continue to teach undergraduate courses like Human   Evolution, Human Origins, Problems and Perspectives in Human Evolution,   and Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior, along with graduate courses   like Interpreting Human Skeletal Morphology and Integrative   Paleoanthropology I. I hope to offer new graduate and undergraduate   courses in the future. I have also been invited to give talks, both   internally at NYU (Evening Evolution Group, Center for Genomics and   Systems Biology) and at other universities (Yale, Stony Brook, and   CUNY). In 2012 and 2013, I served on the American Association of   Physical Anthropologists Program Committee, and, since January 2014 I   have served as Associate Editor at the Journal of Human Evolution. I am   also a contributor to the Encyclopedia of Human Evolution (B.A. Wood, ed. 2013 and online).    In addition to continuing PhD students, Cody Prang and Jenny Eyre,   Dr. Gabrielle Russo worked with me as a post-doctoral researcher in the   Spring of 2014. We are currently finalizing several research projects on   fossil hominin vertebrae and a comparative study of the ursid (bear)   vertebral column, with implications for the evolution of convergent   traits in hominoids (apes). This fall, Alex DeCasien joins the PhD   program to work with me and Dr. James Higham on skeletal correlates of   sexual selection.

Current News/Projects                            Updated August 2014 I am an evolutionary morphologist and paleoanthropologist with   primary research interests in the evolution of positional behavior   (posture and locomotion) during human evolution. My research focus is   not on a particular time period; rather, I am   interested in evolutionary transitions in the hominoid fossil record,   from 20 million-year-old extinct apes to modern human and ape variation   and the entirety of human evolution in between. The major focus of my   academic work has been on the primate postcranial skeleton and   specifically the vertebral column (spine). I have worked to describe and   analyze in a large comparative dataset the vertebral column of a new   species of early hominin, Australopithecus sediba . Late last   year, I was part of a team that excavated and cataloged a large number   of hominin fossils at Rising Star Cave in the Cradle of Humankind, South   Africa. I worked with an international team of researchers this summer   to describe what is likely a new and surprising species of hominin that   will undoubtedly alter the way we think about human evolution.      I continue to teach undergraduate courses like Human   Evolution, Human Origins, Problems and Perspectives in Human Evolution,   and Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior, along with graduate courses   like Interpreting Human Skeletal Morphology and Integrative   Paleoanthropology I. I hope to offer new graduate and undergraduate   courses in the future. I have also been invited to give talks, both   internally at NYU (Evening Evolution Group, Center for Genomics and   Systems Biology) and at other universities (Yale, Stony Brook, and   CUNY). In 2012 and 2013, I served on the American Association of   Physical Anthropologists Program Committee, and, since January 2014 I   have served as Associate Editor at the Journal of Human Evolution. I am   also a contributor to the Encyclopedia of Human Evolution (B.A. Wood, ed. 2013 and online).    In addition to continuing PhD students, Cody Prang and Jenny Eyre,   Dr. Gabrielle Russo worked with me as a post-doctoral researcher in the   Spring of 2014. We are currently finalizing several research projects on   fossil hominin vertebrae and a comparative study of the ursid (bear)   vertebral column, with implications for the evolution of convergent   traits in hominoids (apes). This fall, Alex DeCasien joins the PhD   program to work with me and Dr. James Higham on skeletal correlates of   sexual selection.
