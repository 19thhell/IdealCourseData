Its goal is to enable talented young writers to discover their strengths and develop their craft under the guidance of prominent Latin American, Spanish, and Latino writers. It is a two-year program of 32 points (i.e., eight courses, two per semester) and a special project at the end. The requirements for admission are a B.A. or Licenciatura in any field of study, a writing sample consisting of 8 to10 poems or 20 pages of prose (fiction, essay), a statement of purpose (500-1000 words), three letters of recommendation, an official transcript of undergraduate studies, GRE scores, and TOEFL scores (for those whose native language is not English). An admissions committee consisting of the director of the Creative Writing Program, a clinical professor, and visiting faculty teaching in the program on a regular basis will review applications. The statement of purpose, the writing sample, and the letters of recommendation are the most decisive factors in this review. The program consists of two required courses on general writing issues Approaches to Narrative and Poetry, SPAN-GA 4001, and either Forms and Techniques of Fiction and Nonfiction Prose, SPAN-GA 4002, or Forms and Techniques of Poetry, SPAN-GA 4003, four writing workshops (at least two in the field in which the student plans to specialize), and two electives. Workshops will be offered in fiction, poetry, creative nonfiction, and translation. Additional workshops will be added to the program as needed. The two elective courses may be in the Creative Writing Program, the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, or in another department, with an adviser's approval. Students will also write a final project with the counsel of a faculty member at the second year of their course of study. Students write a final independent project under the supervision of a faculty member consisting of between 50-75 pages for prose or 30 pages for poetry. The project may be one long piece or a series of shorter pieces. This final project may include, or may be an expansion of work begun during previous courses, but it should represent a culminating effort to shape stories, prose, pieces, a long work, or a group of poems into a coherent, self-sufficient work.
