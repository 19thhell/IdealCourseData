The incorporation of genetic theory into evolutionary theory Although Darwin was very successful at convincing his contemporaries about the fact that evolution had occurred, he was much less successful at convincing his colleagues that his mechanism of Natural Selection was the major mechanism of evolutionary change. This was mainly because there was no satisfactory explanation for inheritance, or for how variation originated. Darwin himself was plagued by his inability to understand inheritance, and was dissatisfied by his own theory of inheritance, pangenesis and blending inheritance, because blending suggested that variation should be halved each generation and would rapidly be lost. (Darwin called it his &quot;well abused theory of Pangenesis&quot;, and postulated rapid origins of new variation. Maybe if Darwin had improved his math skills...?) In 1883, A. Weismann (1834-1914) proposed that the germ plasm was separate from (and thus immune to influences from) the soma. Indeed, this principle is reflected in the \"Central Dogma\" of molecular biology. The \"central dogma\" of the NeoDarwinian view is that evolution can only occur by genetic change. There are some notable exceptions, such as \"gene amplification\", cortical inheritance of disturbed patterns of cilia inherited in ciliated protozoa, and inherited \"states of cell activation\" in Daphnia . In 1865 (only 6 years after Darwin's Origin ), in an Augustinian monastery in Brno, a Czech town, Gregor Mendel discovered some of the \"rules\" of diploid inheritance. Mendel's work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the 1900s. Mendel demonstrated particulate inheritance, dispensing with the problems of blending inheritance. This mode of inheritance was initially used to argue against natural selection being a strong force: Since variants or mutants observed by early geneticists had discrete effects, and species differed discretely, species could have arisen by discrete, perhaps systemic changes (perhaps with a direction determined by orthogenesis or other mechanisms). With the \"Evolutionary (or Modern) Synthesis\", Darwin's theory became reconciled with the facts of genetics, especially with the facts that (1) acquired characters are not inherited and (2) continuous variation has the same Mendelian basis as discrete variation. The theoretical foundations for evolutionary genetics were laid down in 1908 independently be Hardy , Weinberg and Tschetverikov , and subsequently developed by R. A. Fisher (1890-1962) and J. B. S. Haldane (1892-1964) in England and Sewall Wright (1889-1988) in the US. Additional work (e.g., by J. Huxley , T. Dobzhansky ) brought these and other fields (like paleontology) together.  II. Major tenets of the Evolutionary Synthesis A. Populations have genetic variation that continuously arises by undirected processes (mutation and recombination) B. Populations evolve by changes in gene frequencies through: 1. Genetic drift 2. Gene flow 3. Natural selection C. Most adaptive variants have slight phenotypic effects, so that phenotypic changes are gradual D. Diversification arises by speciation (cladogenesis), usually occurring via gradual evolution of reproductive isolation E. These processes, continued for a sufficiently long period of time, produce changes sufficient to delineate higher taxonomic levels (Return to top of page.)

Each track requires that students complete five upper-level Biology electives. In consultation with their adviser or with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students select at least one course from each of the following four skill categories, plus a fifth elective from any one of the categories: Lab Skill Courses, Quantitative Skill Courses, Reasoning Skill Courses and Foundational Courses.      This page lists the courses that satisfy each category for the standard track and the Ecology track, and the semester in which they are usually offered. It also lists courses that serve as electives for the Global Public Health/Science major with concentration in Biology. Courses that will be offered in Fall 2013 are in bold . Graduate (BIOL-GA) courses may be taken with permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Links to recommended four-year course plans are also provided.      Occasionally a new course will be offered as Special Topics in Biology (BIOL-UA 910, 912, 914 , 920, 922, 924, 930, 932, 934 , 940, 942, or 944). The course numbers signify the semester offered ( Fall = 910, 912, 914, 930, 932, 934 ; Spring = 920, 922, 924, 940, 942, 944) and the category the course satisfies for the standard track (Foundational = 910 , 920; Reasoning = 912 , 922; Quantitative = 914 , 924) or the Ecology track (Foundational = 930 , 940; Reasoning = 932 , 942; Quantitative = 934 , 944).

The incorporation of genetic theory into evolutionary theory Although Darwin was very successful at convincing his contemporaries about the fact that evolution had occurred, he was much less successful at convincing his colleagues that his mechanism of Natural Selection was the major mechanism of evolutionary change. This was mainly because there was no satisfactory explanation for inheritance, or for how variation originated. Darwin himself was plagued by his inability to understand inheritance, and was dissatisfied by his own theory of inheritance, pangenesis and blending inheritance, because blending suggested that variation should be halved each generation and would rapidly be lost. (Darwin called it his &quot;well abused theory of Pangenesis&quot;, and postulated rapid origins of new variation. Maybe if Darwin had improved his math skills...?) In 1883, A. Weismann (1834-1914) proposed that the germ plasm was separate from (and thus immune to influences from) the soma. Indeed, this principle is reflected in the \"Central Dogma\" of molecular biology. The \"central dogma\" of the NeoDarwinian view is that evolution can only occur by genetic change. There are some notable exceptions, such as \"gene amplification\", cortical inheritance of disturbed patterns of cilia inherited in ciliated protozoa, and inherited \"states of cell activation\" in Daphnia . In 1865 (only 6 years after Darwin's Origin ), in an Augustinian monastery in Brno, a Czech town, Gregor Mendel discovered some of the \"rules\" of diploid inheritance. Mendel's work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the 1900s. Mendel demonstrated particulate inheritance, dispensing with the problems of blending inheritance. This mode of inheritance was initially used to argue against natural selection being a strong force: Since variants or mutants observed by early geneticists had discrete effects, and species differed discretely, species could have arisen by discrete, perhaps systemic changes (perhaps with a direction determined by orthogenesis or other mechanisms). With the \"Evolutionary (or Modern) Synthesis\", Darwin's theory became reconciled with the facts of genetics, especially with the facts that (1) acquired characters are not inherited and (2) continuous variation has the same Mendelian basis as discrete variation. The theoretical foundations for evolutionary genetics were laid down in 1908 independently be Hardy , Weinberg and Tschetverikov , and subsequently developed by R. A. Fisher (1890-1962) and J. B. S. Haldane (1892-1964) in England and Sewall Wright (1889-1988) in the US. Additional work (e.g., by J. Huxley , T. Dobzhansky ) brought these and other fields (like paleontology) together.  II. Major tenets of the Evolutionary Synthesis A. Populations have genetic variation that continuously arises by undirected processes (mutation and recombination) B. Populations evolve by changes in gene frequencies through: 1. Genetic drift 2. Gene flow 3. Natural selection C. Most adaptive variants have slight phenotypic effects, so that phenotypic changes are gradual D. Diversification arises by speciation (cladogenesis), usually occurring via gradual evolution of reproductive isolation E. These processes, continued for a sufficiently long period of time, produce changes sufficient to delineate higher taxonomic levels (Return to top of page.)

Each track requires that students complete five upper-level Biology electives. In consultation with their adviser or with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students select at least one course from each of the following four skill categories, plus a fifth elective from any one of the categories: Lab Skill Courses, Quantitative Skill Courses, Reasoning Skill Courses and Foundational Courses.      This page lists the courses that satisfy each category for the standard track and the Ecology track, and the semester in which they are usually offered. It also lists courses that serve as electives for the Global Public Health/Science major with concentration in Biology. Courses that will be offered in Fall 2013 are in bold . Graduate (BIOL-GA) courses may be taken with permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Links to recommended four-year course plans are also provided.      Occasionally a new course will be offered as Special Topics in Biology (BIOL-UA 910, 912, 914 , 920, 922, 924, 930, 932, 934 , 940, 942, or 944).

Feel free to spread the word!     Little was known about the mechanism by which genes direct protein synthesis when, in the late 1950s, Francis Crick first articulated the Sequence Hypothesis and the Central Dogma of molecular biology: that sequence information can flow between DNA and RNA and from RNA to protein but not from protein back to nucleic acids. Indeed, the existence of an RNA intermediary (mRNA) carrying instructions for protein synthesis had not yet been confirmed, and the genetic code had not yet been deciphered. Since then, it has become clear that RNA plays a central role in biology, not only as a repository of sequence information but also as a target of regulation, a biochemical catalyst, and a regulator in its own right. The 2011 Skirball Symposium, &ldquo;RNA Biology: Beyond the Central Dogma&rdquo;, will bring together some of the world&rsquo;s leading experts in RNA molecular biology to report recent breakthroughs in understanding the post-transcriptional control of gene expression and the regulatory impact of noncoding RNAs, as well as the importance of these processes for human disease.
