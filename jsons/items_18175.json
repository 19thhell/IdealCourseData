You must also satisfy prerequisites or demonstrate equivalent knowledge in:     Computer literacy   Knowledge of engineering economics   Probability and statistics     Students lacking the relevant knowledge must complete additional courses to satisfy these prerequisites.   Required Core Courses (12 Credits)   3.00 Credits Production Science MN-GY 7893 This course reviews just-in-time and synchronous manufacturing methods. It analyzes the basic dynamics of factories to understand the importance of congestion and bottleneck rates on cycle time and inventories. Analytical models are developed to study variability and randomness introduced by breakdown, setups and batching. Simulation studies are used to provide data on performance of transfer lines. 3.00 Credits Quality Control and Improvement MN-GY 6113 This course provides students with a solid foundation in the cost of quality, quality assurance and quality management. Emphasis is placed on the basic tools of quality control such as control charts and their use, the concept of \u201cout of control,\u201d acceptance sampling, variables and attributes charts, and producer\u2019s and consumer\u2019s risk. This course uniquely demonstrates the power of teams of people with different expertise to improve quality. A course project is required. Prerequisite: MA-GY 6513 Applied Statistics I (Data Analysis) or equivalent. Also listed as IE-GY 6113. 3.00 Credits Design for Manufacturability MN-GY 7923 This course introduces concepts and techniques for economical, functionally sound and high-quality product design for manufacture. The emphasis is on designing for easy robotic and manual assembly, and on using plastics effectively to reduce manufacturing costs. Managerial and organizational approaches and case studies of successful designs are reviewed. Also listed as IE-GY 7923. 3.00 Credits Supply Chain Engineering MN-GY 7993 Students in this course gain an understanding of how companies plan, source, make and deliver their products with a global competitive advantage. The course stresses the engineering components in developing an integrated supply chain that covers the entire manufacturing enterprise. It looks at the supply-chain infrastructure and the velocities of different models. The focus is on understanding and detecting the constraints of the infrastructure and the lowest common denominator of the information system used. Students also gain an understanding of logistical networks and the optimizing of the various traffic and location alternatives. Synchronization of supply and demand is examined in detail, looking at variability in both processes with the objective of maximizing throughput and capacity, emphasizing partnering, e-commerce and the bullwhip effect. Finally, the course establishes global performance measurements that compare companies in different industries. Also listed as IE-GY 7993.   Electives (18 Credits)     3 electives from Manufacturing or Industrial Engineering for a total of 9 credits   3 electives from any other graduate curriculum with the approval of the Program Director (to ensure that they are compatible your professional objectives) for a total of 9 credits     You are encouraged to organize your electives into &ldquo;concentrations.&quot; These concentrations satisfy the needs of your careers and, for those who are working, the needs of the firm.

Addressing these problems requires creative thinkers focused on the design and adoption of modern methods. But such methods are only effective when they&rsquo;ve been accepted for use.   With this in mind, the MS in Manufacturing Engineering program supplements robust design concepts and production techniques with courses on managing the human side of technological change. By specifically addressing how to overcome cultural barriers, we train our students to identify the most effective means to help high-performance teams succeed.   You will learn how to evaluate and implement production improvements by applying new methods and by using software for design and simulation. By program&#39;s end, you will have not only a working knowledge of advanced methods and techniques used worldwide in manufacturing, but also the hands-on experience required to advance your career in a leadership position. In addition to hands-on projects in your courses, we often make arrangements for our students to obtain internships in local industries.   Admission Requirements   This program is open to those holding an accredited engineering degree (BS or BE); to graduates in physics, chemistry, materials science and the biological sciences; and to those holding an MBA.
