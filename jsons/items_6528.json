The voice mail system is available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Messages can be retrieved via touchtone phone from anywhere in the world. Each user is provided with what is called a voice mailbox. The voice mailbox is usually associated with your NYU telephone extension. Each mailbox is protected by a unique password.    If your phone is in use or you do not answer, the call will route automatically to your voice mailbox following your phone's call coverage path. Upon reaching the voice mail system, callers hear your own personal greeting. Your greeting can be changed as often as you wish. All messages are time- and date-stamped by the system. When new voice messages have been received, the message waiting lamp on your telephone will light. The average mailbox has approximately 20 minutes of speech space. Saved messages remain in the mailbox for a period of 16 days after which the system automatically removes them.    Logging into Your Mailbox     Dial your assigned voice mail system access number. The access numbers are 799 or 6500-1799 from outside NYU. The appropriate access numbers are provided when your voice mail is established.   Enter your extension number plus the \" # \" sign. If you are dialing from your own extension, just press \" # \".   Enter your password plus \" # \". Once you have logged in, the voice mail system prompts you through all of its functions. If you are familiar with the prompts and codes to use, you need not listen to the prompts; simply make the appropriate entries.      Creating and Sending Messages   To electronically send a message to another voice mailbox without calling the party:      Log into your mailbox (if you haven't already done so).
