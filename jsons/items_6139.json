MS and Advanced Certificate Programs   The master's and advanced certificate programs are designed for nurses seeking advanced roles in clinical practice (nurse practitioners and nurse midwives), nursing administration, education, and informatics, while providing the necessary foundation for doctoral study. Graduates are prepared for leadership positions in teaching, clinical consultation, nursing management, administration, and advanced nursing practice in care of the adult, care of the elderly, care of infants, children, adolescents, mental health, holistic nursing, palliative care nursing (specialty sequence) and nurse midwifery. Whatever program is selected, the curriculum includes a core in nursing theory, research, statistics, population-focused care, and issues and trends in health care delivery.   DNP Program   The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree is the advanced nursing practice credential of the future! As the highest level of academic preparation for advanced clinical practice, the DNP prepares scholars for advanced clinical practice in a population focus area. In addition, DNP students learn to translate evidence-based knowledge into clinical practice and have a significant impact on health outcomes by strengthening system-level health care processes.   There are currently three entry points for the DNP Program:       NEW Post-Baccalaureate (BS) to DNP option for those who are registered nurses with a baccalaureate degree in nursing   Advanced Standing option for those who have earned a master\u2019s degree and are nurse practitioners (NPs) or certified nurse midwives (CNMs)   Post-Master\u2019s Bridge option for those nurses who have a master\u2019s degree but are not NPs or CNMs         PhD Program   The college\u2019s PhD program in Nursing Research and Theory Development is designed to prepare nurse researchers. The curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the philosophy of scientific inquiry, theory development in nursing science, quantitative and qualitative research designs, and methodological approaches to data management and analyses. Graduates of the PhD program assume major positions in academic, health care, research, and practice settings. Students may apply after having completed a master\u2019s degree or earlier during their educational trajectory in an effort to expedite the transition from baccalaureate or master\u2019s degree preparation to the research doctorate. The BS-to-PhD and MS-to-PhD pathways allow students to apply at the time of application to the BS/MS Dual Degree program or to the MS program.

TOSH educators and clinicians have developed an educational and clinical innovation transitioning the traditional head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT) examination to the addition of the teeth, gums, mucosa, tongue, and palate examination (HEENOT) for assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of oral\u2013systemic health problems. They detail their findings in a paper, \u201c Putting the Mouth Back in the Head: HEENT to HEENOT ,\u201d published in the American Journal of Public Health.     \u201cAt TOSH, we are challenging the medical profession, including nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, physicians, and physician assistants to \u2018Put the Mouth Back in the Head\u2019 by transitioning from the traditional HEENT exam to the HEENOT exam,\u201d said Dr. Judith Haber, Associate Dean for Graduate Programs and Principal Investigator for the TOSH Program. \u201cIncorporating \u2018O\u2019 for oral cavity assessment, adds a comprehensive focus on the oral-systemic history and physical examination of the teeth, gums, mucosa, gums and palate.\u201d&amp;nbsp;     For the majority of primary care providers, the traditional HEENT exam excludes examination of the oral cavity, as well as omitting oral health and its linkages to overall health in the patients\u2019 health history, physical examination, risk assessment and management plan. The HEENOT approach means that educators and clinicians cannot omit oral health from the history and physical examination performed by health professionals.     &quot;The integration of the HEENOT approach in primary care is a simple and effective method to decrease oral health disparities by increasing interprofessional oral health workforce capacity,\u201d said Dr. Erin Hartnett, TOSH Program Director. \u201cThe TOSH program, using the HEENOT approach, develops the nurse practitioner, midwifery and medical students' oral health knowledge and clinical practice skills to identify oral problems, educate patients about the links between oral health and their overall health and refer patients to dental providers.   The aim of the TOSH program is develop innovative simulation and \u201clive\u201d interprofessional clinical experiences that focus on oral-systemic health for nurse practitioner, midwifery, medical and dental students. The HEENOT paradigm shift has been a cornerstone of these unique collaborative experiences.     \u201cThe TOSH program has dramatically enhanced the interprofessional collaboration between the nurse practitioner, dental, and medical students,\u201d said Dr. Ken Allen, Associate Chair and Clinical Associate Professor, Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care at NYU College of Dentistry. \u201cWorking together, they have formed a unique bond while teaching and promoting the concept of including the oral examination as an integral part of every patient assessment, something that was often overlooked in the past.&quot;     The TOSH team notes the importance of using the HEENOT approach as an integral component of primary care:     Early childhood caries (cavities) are the most common chronic disease of childhood in 5-17 year olds, 5 times more common than asthma   Application of fluoride varnish can reduce the incidence of caries in children by up to 50%   Oral cancer morbidity and mortality rates have not declined over the past 10 years, at least, in part, related to absent or inadequate oral exams   Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with the recent rise in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer   Linkages between diabetes and periodontal disease are established   Older adults taking multiple medications for chronic health problems often have xerostomia (dry mouth) increasing their risk for tooth decay and poor nutrition       The Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) recent report, Integrating Oral Health and Primary Care Practice , highlights the importance of the primary care workforce developing interprofessional oral health core competencies that increase consumer access to preventive oral health care from multiple non-dental professions including but not limited to physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, midwives, physician assistants, and pharmacists.     \u201cNYU Nursing\u2019s innovative partnership with NYU\u2019s College of Dentistry provided a unique opportunity for the TOSH Program to be a strong voice for advancing an interprofessional oral health agenda\u201d, said Dr. Haber. \u201cThe exposure to interprofessional oral health HEENOT classroom, simulation, and clinical experiences was associated with increased dental\u2013primary care referrals.\u201d     With oral health becoming recognized as integral to the general health of populations across the life span, clinical education programs preparing the next generation of health professionals can rectify the dearth of oral health content and clinical experiences by adopting the HEENOT approach as a standard component of the curriculum.
