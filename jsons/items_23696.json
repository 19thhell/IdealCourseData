first-of-its-kind joint program housed in the Silver School of Social Work and the Wagner School of Public Service. The minor consists of academically rigorous, civically engaged classes that provide students of all faith backgrounds (including those who are unaffiliated with a particular faith tradition) the opportunity to engage purposefully in holistic multifaith dialogue, service, and academic work. It also equips students to better understand their own faith traditions and spiritual beliefs while simultaneously engaging in multifaith learning, in and beyond the classroom. The minor is not only for the religious but it is also for students who are interested in faith and multifaith dialogue as important social phenomena, regardless of their own faith stance.   Students wishing to minor in multifaith and spiritual leadership should make an appointment with Dr. Marcella Runell Hall, director of the Of Many Multifaith Institute for Leadership, and clinical instructor at the Silver School of Social Work, to develop an academic plan.
