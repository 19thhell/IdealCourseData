About the Center   The Center analyzes important issues of criminal law, particularly focusing on prosecutorial power and discretion. It pursues this mission in three main arenas: academia, the courts, and public policy debates. Through the Center's academic component, the Center researches criminal justice practices at all levels of government, produces scholarship on criminal justice issues, and hosts symposia and conferences to address significant topics in criminal law and procedure. The litigation component uses the Center\u2019s research and experience with criminal justice practices to inform courts in important criminal justice matters, particularly in cases in which exercises of prosecutorial discretion create significant legal issues. The public policy component applies the Center\u2019s criminal justice expertise to improve practices in the criminal justice system and enhance the public dialogue on criminal justice matters. The Center is the first and only organization dedicated to defining good government practices in criminal prosecutions.
