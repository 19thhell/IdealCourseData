We pursue discipline-based inquiries and scholarly research to increase knowledge and expertise in these domains and to transform the way educators understand and teach dance.    Traditionally, dance is not taught as a domain of understanding; rather, it is taught as received knowledge. Our approach is to move away from a knowledge-centered curriculum &ndash; &ldquo;The passive mind, active body: ideal &ndash; wherein submissive learners &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; dance content through a dominant pedagogy. Instead, we provide a curriculum that requires critical and creative thinking about, and deliberate practice with, key concepts in dance, human development and socio-cultural educational settings.    Our &ldquo;thinking-centered&rdquo; approach to dance education necessitates the integration of the developing mind and body in the context of educational/cultural practices. Therefore, our curricular structure is based on three areas of inquiry: 1) discipline-based inquiry which allows the dance artist to master his/her craft, 2) pedagogic-based inquiry that enables deep understanding of teaching and learning processes, and 3) research-based inquiry, which provides theory and methods for creating new knowledge in the field.    Our core courses begin with students developing and examining a personal vision for teaching and learning. Core courses sequence to give students a continual opportunity to integrate their prior-experiences with new knowledge; and culminate in highly individualized projects that evidence the integration of theory and practice. Electives from both inside and outside the program aid students in honing in on particular topics, interests or issues that support their vision. The learning experience in many of our courses is organized around conducting fieldwork in socio-cultural settings such as schools, colleges, institutions and cultural organizations. Through fieldwork, students have the opportunity to analyze educational models, exercise researcher skills, develop professional networks, and to awaken to the &ldquo;realistic idealism&rdquo; that propels the future growth of arts education.    Advanced Certificate in Teaching Dance    The Advanced Certificate in Teaching Dance , All Grades is designed for prospective students who have earned an MA or MFA in Dance, and who wish to be certified in Teaching Dance, All Grades (Pre-K-12).

Graduates of our program are teachers of dance at preschools, elementary, junior and senior high schools, colleges and universities. They work as teaching artists for some of the top service organizations such as the National Dance Institute, American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, The Joyce Theatre and Young Audiences. They are administrators for dance companies, directors of educational programs, writers for dance publications, community-based organizers, choreographers, and performers of all styles and forms of dance.    Our curriculum includes seminar-based courses where students are guided in preparing professional materials and teaching portfolios. Our strong presence at the national conference of the National Dance Education Organization (www.NDEO.org) provides students with job networking opportunities in the higher education field. Our close relationship to the NYS Dept. of Ed. and the NYC Dept. of Ed provides a strong preK-12 job network. Our graduates are highly sought after in the NYC preK-12 schools.    The NYU Office of Career Services offers extensive assistance in finding the best available teaching positions that match your interests and ambitions. The office offers sessions on resume writing and interviewing and notifies graduate students when representatives of larges school systems come to campus to recruit teachers. The New York City Board of Education holds an annual job fair, providing information about licensing, hiring procedures, and job openings.
