The SE2 detects secondary as well as backscattered electrons and shows pronounced topography. High efficiency in lens SE detection can produce high resolution surface structure images. The Merlin also includes an in lens EsB detector with filtering grid, offering energy and angle-selective backscattered electron imaging for highest material contrast. It also includes the multi-segment, Si diode-based CZ BSD back scattered electron detector. X-ray microanalysis is available using the Oxford Instruments EDS with integrated INCA software. In addition to SEM, the Merlin includes STEM detection for high resolution images of TEM samples. The column also offers high resolution imaging at low acceleration voltages and low beam currents. Technical data: resolution (optimal WD) = 0.8 nm @ 15 kV, 1.4 nm @ 1 kV, 0.6 nm @ 30 kV (STEM mode); magnification = 12 \u2013 2,000,000 x in SE mode; 5-axis motorized stage, \u20133 to 70 tilt; chamber volume = 330 mm (\u00d8) x 270 mm (h); local charge compensation device (stainless steel needle injects nitrogen gas into the region of interest); image resolution up to 6144 x 4608 pixels; integrated SmartSEM user interface based on Windows operating system controlled by mouse, keyboard, joystick and control panel.

Frequently Asked Questions                                           Where can I study?                               NYU offers undergraduate academic opportunities in many of the world's most fascinating cities--Abu Dhabi, Accra, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Shanghai, Sydney, Tel Aviv, and Washington, DC. Current NYU undergraduates and students at other accredited colleges are eligible to enroll for a semester or academic year. NYU students are also eligible to apply for the International Exchange Program. Other international opportunities are offered by individual schools of the University during the semester, Summer Sessions, or January Term.                                                                When am I eligible to study away from my degree campus?                               A small group of NYU freshmen are selected to begin their NYU degree outside the United States. Other students are eligible to study abroad once they have reached sophomore status, and through their last semester senior year. Students must complete one year on a college campus enrolled full-time to be considered a sophomore.                                                                   Do I need to know a foreign language to enroll?                               Each NYU location offers courses instructed in English as well as in the local language. Students with no language background will choose a beginner level language course, while advanced students will choose one or more courses instructed in the local language.                                                              If I am not a US citizen, may I study at one of the NYU locations?                               International students who are enrolled in US-accredited colleges and universities are eligible to study with NYU as a short-term visting student. Students must currently be enrolled in order to be eligible.                                                                Are graduate students eligible to study away?                               The Global Academic Centers offer undergraduate courses only except in the case of full degree programs offered in Florence, London, Madrid, and Paris. There are numerous international opportunities for graduate students offered through schools and departments. Check with your academic department to see which programs are available                                                              May I study at one of the NYU locations if I am not an NYU student?                               NYU welcomes applications from all students attending US-accredited colleges and universities. You are encouraged to talk with an adviser at your home university to ensure you will receive credit for classes taken at NYU. NYU is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.                                       Questions?
