Miller, Andrew M. Watkins, Neville R. Kallenbach, and Paramjit S. Arora   Helix\u2013coil transition theory connects observable properties of the \u03b1-helix to an ensemble of microstates and provides a foundation for analyzing secondary structure formation in proteins. Classical models account for cooperative helix formation in terms of an energetically demanding nucleation event (described by the \u03c3 constant) followed by a more facile propagation reaction, with corresponding s constants that are sequence dependent. Extensive studies of folding and unfolding in model peptides have led to the determination of the propagation constants for amino acids. However, the role of individual side chains in helix nucleation has not been separately accessible, so the \u03c3 constant is treated as independent of sequence. We describe here a synthetic model that allows the assessment of the role of individual amino acids in helix nucleation. Studies with this model lead to the surprising conclusion that widely accepted scales of helical propensity are not predictive of helix nucleation. Residues known to be helix stabilizers or breakers in propagation have only a tenuous relationship to residues that favor or disfavor helix nucleation.   Reference: PNAS , 2014 111 (18) 6636-6641.
