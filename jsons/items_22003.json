Wolniak presents his findings on April 18 with co-author Mark E. Engberg of Loyola University Chicago at the American Education Research Association \u2019s annual meeting.   Researchers have long been trying to answer the elusive question: Is college worth it? Previous studies have focused on the relationship between college education and earnings upon graduation, but much less is known about college\u2019s effect on non-monetary, attitudinal career outcomes.   A 2007 report from the Association of American Colleges &amp; Universities highlighted a set of \u201chigh-impact\u201d practices \u2013 such as internships, community-based learning, studying abroad, and research outside of the classroom \u2013 that cultivate the kinds of learning and development students need for success. Employers even seek college graduates with these experiences, finding that they are better prepared for the workplace.   Wolniak and Engberg\u2019s study explores the connection between high-impact college experiences and career outcomes in the years immediately following college graduation, using 2012 follow up data from the Education Longitudinal Study, the most current and nationally representative data on students\u2019 transitions from college to the labor market.   The researchers analyzed a set of high-impact college experiences \u2013 internships, research outside of class, studying abroad, community-based projects, and senior capstones \u2013 in relationship to career outcomes immediately following graduation. While earlier research focused on earnings, this study looked at both earnings and non-monetary measures: graduates\u2019 attitudes toward their jobs (including a supportive work environment, job satisfaction, and job commitment) and continued learning and challenge in their jobs.   The results suggest that high-impact experiences have a relatively small and inconsistent influence on career outcomes in the years right after college graduation, and specific experiences seem to only predict certain outcomes.   For instance, internships and community-based projects appear to lead students into jobs that offer new challenges, serve a social purpose, and provide opportunities for continued learning. There was also a positive relationship between participating in a senior capstone experience and being employed in a supportive work environment. However, studying abroad was not related to any career outcomes, and none of the high-impact experiences measured affected job satisfaction or commitment.   Consistent with past studies, the researchers found that attending a selective institution, rather than a moderate or inclusive institution, substantially improves earnings in the years immediately following college, with graduates of selective institutions reporting on average 16 to 18 percent higher earnings. However, a college\u2019s standing had no effect on attitudinal outcomes.   The researchers also found that college majors exert the largest effect on attitudinal measures, and also significantly influence early career earnings. While business majors enjoy comparable earnings to STEM majors, the former reported significantly lower levels of learning, satisfaction, and challenge on the job; in contrast, education majors earn substantially less than STEM majors but are more satisfied and committed to their jobs. In general, students working in jobs closely related to their majors reported more than 15 percent higher earnings.   \u201cWe had anticipated finding more consistent and stronger evidence that high-impact practices have a positive influence on earnings and other aspects of career success,\u201d Wolniak said. \u201cOur findings suggest that to earn more and enjoy the attitudinal outcomes we examined, students would benefit from support in securing jobs related to their majors.\u201d   The researchers said that these results should not be used to call into question the importance of high-impact college experiences in terms of student learning and development, but do recommend using caution before suggesting that the positive influence high-impact experiences have on learning will translate to career gains.

In less than one year, NYU Shanghai will open its doors to students.\u00a0 A partnership between New York University (NYU), the largest independent research university in the United States and East China Normal University), NYU Shanghai will be the first university in China authorized to award a degree from a foreign university, as well as a Chinese degree recognized by the Ministry of Education.\u00a0 In that sense, NYU will be the first American university authorized by the Ministry of Education to award degrees in China.\u00a0 This will be an exciting time for higher education in both China and America.\u00a0   To that end, while construction is underway for NYU Shanghai\u2019s campus in Pudong, admission outreach officers are canvassing the globe, searching for the best and brightest young people for admission to NYU Shanghai\u2019s inaugural class in September 2013 (just less than half of the student body will be international).\u00a0 With initial enrollment at roughly 200 to 300 students, these students will all have the opportunity to take advantage of NYU\u2019s global network of campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi, and eleven Study Away Sites.\u00a0 What further distinguishes NYU Shanghai, however, is how students will be recruited and selected for admission.\u00a0\u00a0   NYU Shanghai will provide an education that combines the best of higher-education traditions from the US and China.\u00a0 Our curriculum, student body and faculty are deliberately international in outlook and composition.\u00a0 Our students will be ambassadors to the world as exemplars of open-mindedness and innovative thinkers.\u00a0 With their exposure to different strands of thought and cultures, they can bridge communication gaps.\u00a0 Similarly, NYU Shanghai\u2019s admissions process hopes to bridge and join the best of admissions practices from the US and China.   Transcripts, Test Scores, and Beyond:\u00a0 Best Fit   Universities in the US place extraordinary emphasis on high school academic performance and analyze each student\u2019s courses and grades received in the last 3-4 years. Attention is paid to a student\u2019s academic success in more traditional subjects including math, the physical sciences, the social sciences, the humanities, and languages (including English).   Admissions officers also look, of course, at teacher recommendations, standardized test scores, essays, and extracurricular activities. In that sense, admissions offices are looking beyond academic excellence for students who are the \u201cbest fit\u201d for the university.\u00a0 Every university has a specific culture and type of student who thrives in their learning environment.\u00a0 It is the job of the admissions officers to find those students.\u00a0 These other submission materials such as essays, letters of recommendation, and interviews are useful tools for identifying whether students would bring interesting perspectives to the classroom and if they are the right student for the university.\u00a0 Interviews are a tool that the admissions team uses to not only evaluate student credentials, but to also gauge a student\u2019s character.\u00a0   In consideration of and respect for China\u2019s unique education environment, the admission selection process for NYU Shanghai goes beyond traditional US practices and instead represents a new model in higher education anywhere, and certainly unprecedented in China. Applicants will be rigorously evaluated not only on the basis of national entrance examinations like the all-important Gaokao for Chinese students, but through a holistic analysis of multiple quantitative and qualitative variables. Similar to the US admission process for NYU, both Chinese and international students are required to submit essays and recommendations, and complete the Common Application, the application universities in the U.S. utilize to capture qualitative information about each applicant.\u00a0 In addition, all students for NYU Shanghai will be interviewed for admission. Students\u2019 overall competencies are then carefully examined during a Candidates Weekend, a unique program tailored toward discerning student fit with NYU Shanghai.   Through the holistic evaluation of the credentials above, NYU Shanghai will attempt to identify not just the strongest students by traditionally-defined and respected measures such as the Gaokao, but will be offering Chinese students a new hybrid model for admission to elite universities.\u00a0 This hybrid model will allow NYU Shanghai to identify the right students amongst the world\u2019s most talented applicant pool and most importantly, discern the Best Fit for NYU Shanghai.   Drawing on the Experience of NYU Abu Dhabi   As the second degree-granting campus in NYU\u2019s global network and the first outside of the US, NYU Abu Dhabi\u2019s success in attracting the brightest students from around the globe provides a solid foundation for NYU Shanghai\u2019s admissions process. A key objective of the admissions process across the three degree-granting campuses is to identify students with the ability to translate their academic excellence into all facets of life.\u00a0 In order to discern this ability, NYU Abu Dhabi designed a unique Candidate Weekend, where top applicants for admission are invited to the campus in Abu Dhabi for a two-day session.   During the weekend, students introduce themselves to their peers and members of the university community, learn about NYU Abu Dhabi, and for those attending from outside of Abu Dhabi, the city itself.\u00a0 In smaller groups, they participate in various activities, such as solving puzzles together and attending sample lectures. Students engage in conversations with faculty members and university leadership as well as complete a reflective writing assignment. The various activities that comprise the weekend not only allow NYU Abu Dhabi to further evaluate in-person an applicant\u2019s suitability, but also give top contenders for admission with an invaluable first-hand opportunity to evaluate whether NYU Abu Dhabi is right for them.   What is NYU Shanghai looking for?   As mentioned above, an outstanding transcript is necessary, but does not guarantee a place in NYU Shanghai; the overall capabilities of a student will also be evaluated.   First, our students must all be able to communicate in and out of the classroom.\u00a0 We will require all students to have a strong grasp of English \u2013 listening, speaking, writing and reading.\u00a0 Our classes will be conducted in English.\u00a0 By the time the students graduate, they should be fluent in English.   With regard to individual characteristics, the ideal NYU Shanghai student will possess a willingness to open him/herself to new experiences, a sense of intellectual adventure, and a desire to push him/herself by learning to listen and ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0 At his/her core, the NYU Shanghai student possesses a deep sense of curiosity (whether as an innovator or a problem solver), a sense of civic responsibility, and empathy.\u00a0 In short, we are looking for tomorrow\u2019s inventors, entrepreneurs, scholars, and leaders.   Financial Aid   Inspired by the plan the Ministry of Education released in April to increase enrollment for disadvantaged students, NYU Shanghai, like many other universities, is committed to providing equal opportunities to all talented students.\u00a0 It is NYU Shanghai\u2019s principle as well as core value to ensure that students\u2019 educations are not limited by their financial hardship.   Shawn L. Abbott is the Assistant Vice President for Admissions at New York University in the United States.\u00a0 Before coming to NYU, he was the Director of Admission at Stanford University in California from 2006-2010. He previously served on the admissions committees at Columbia University in New York and Boston University.\u00a0 He holds a doctor of education degree from Columbia, where he studied the architectural, economic, and social impact of urban colleges and universities in America.   R. May Lee is the Vice Chancellor, Strategic Planning - Asia for NYU, and Deputy Vice Chancellor for NYU Shanghai. She is a key partner in developing the University\u2019s growing portfolio in Asia and in particular, spearheading the effort to develop NYU Shanghai.\u00a0 One of her primary responsibilities is to head the admissions effort for the inaugural class of NYU Shanghai.
