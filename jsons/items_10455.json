Voids allow the imagination to introduce the boundaries or limits that secure the smooth functioning of thought: the realm of objectivity takes shape by picturing what exceeds thinking and language as an empty space. Rhetoric, we may say, reconfigures meaning by evoking, naming or performing absence (ellipsis, catachresis, apostrophe\u2026). This seminar explores the poetic art of creating emptiness. We will seek inspiration in a range of poetic, artistic and theoretical texts, possibly including works by Aeschylus, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, G\u00f3ngora, Vel\u00e1zquez, Kant, Keats, Baudelaire, Gautier, Mallarm\u00e9, Freud, Saussure, Salinas, Stevens, Heidegger, Ponge, Diego, Beckett, Levinas, Lezama Lima, Sarduy, Laclau, Johnson.    Special Topics in Theory: What\u2019s Happening? EVENT in Philosophy, Literature, Psychoanalysis Ronell A sequel to last year\u2019s seminar on Derrida, et. al. and the Event, we will explore motifs such as love and catastrophe in exemplary literary and philosophical texts. Students are urged to have read thoroughly at least one book by the instructor in preparation for outstanding discussions.
