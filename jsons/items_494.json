The simulations are based on mathematical models, numerical methods, and Matlab programming techniques that are taught in class. The use of animations (and sound where appropriate) to present the results of simulations is emphasized. The course is organized around student projects, which may be done individually or in teams. The main course requirement is to do three projects during the semester. Each project involves a written proposal, an in-class presentation, and a written report. The Recitation for this class is a Computer Lab, in which the students learn the details of computing in Matlab. This is also a place for students to work together on their projects and to get immediate help from the TA.        CSCI-UA.0380-001    Topics of General Interest: Physical Computing    Course call#: 11057   prereq: CSCI-UA.0002    This course takes interactive computing beyond the limitations of the  mouse, the keyboard and the monitor. It brings the revolutionary power  of the semiconductor away from the home and office and into the physical  world of everyday life. We learn to program microcontrollers, which are  single-chip computers that can easily fit in the palm of your hand.  Through a variety of electronic sensors, we detect aspects of the  physical world, such as light, sound, and touch, to input that data into  our programs. The applications create meaningful output using lights,  motors, and speakers. This course teaches hands-on electronics as  students build projects using wires, circuits, and other components.       CSCI-UA.0380-002   Topics of General Interest: Drawing on the Web   Course call#: 11731   prereq: CSCI-UA.0004    The Web is an intrinsically visual medium whose graphical capabilities  are diverse and evolving. With the introduction of HTML5 and CSS3, there  are now multiple ways to code images and animation natively in the  browser. This course will provide a survey of current drawing  techniques. We will create a series of Web-based projects that involve  raster graphics, vector graphics, and interactivity using HTML, CSS,  SVG, and JavaScript. Drawing on the Web builds upon foundations in Web  design and computer programming with a focus on the range of graphics  that can be coded into Web pages.       CSCI-UA.0380-003   Technology and Economic Development   Course call#: 19552   prereq: CSCI-UA.0102    This course will cover topics on the interface between economics and computer science, with special emphasis on issues of importance to economically developing regions. Students will work in teams to tackle real-world and interdisciplinary problems. Students will address questions of markets and economic development using Information and Communications Technologies for Development (ICTD) techniques in the context of development through visits to NYU field sites in the UAE, Ghana and Ethiopia. The course will use Network and Graph Theory as well as modern game theory as the underlying tool of analysis. There will also be exposure to practical elements of developing ICTD interventions and projects, with emphasis on mobile phone apps and others which can be delivered in developing country contexts.                     top | contact webmaster@cs.nyu.edu"}]}]
