That classical perspectives from these fields are not adequate to address emerging problems in \"Big Data\" is apparent from their sharply divergent nature at an elementary level&mdash;in computer science, the growth of the number of data points is a source of \"complexity\" that must be tamed via algorithms or hardware, whereas in statistics, the growth of the number of data points is a source of \"simplicity\" in that inferences are generally stronger and asymptotic results can be invoked. We wish to blend these perspectives. In this talk we show how statistical decision theory provides a mathematical point of departure for achieving such a blending. We develop theoretical tradeoffs between statistical risk, amount of data and \"externalities\" such as computation, communication and privacy. We develop procedures that allow one to choose desired operating points along such tradeoff curves. [Joint work with Venkat Chandrasekaran, John Duchi, Martin Wainwright and Yuchen Zhang].       TOPIC: Dept. of Population Health Grand Rounds Seminar: The Use of Breast Cancer Absolute Risk Models in Counseling and Disease Prevention    SPEAKER: Mitchell Gail (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health) DATE: Thursday, December 19, 2013 TIME: 9:00-10:00AM PLACE: 227 East 30th Street (between 2nd and 3rd Avenues) Translational Research Building, 1st floor, Seminar Room 120    Dr. Gail is Senior Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics of the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Gail has pioneered the use of statistical modeling to predict cancer risk and help patients and physicians make decisions in cancer prevention and treatment. The widely-used Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool is based on the Gail Model that bears his name. Dr. Gail&rsquo;s work has also addressed clinical trials of lung cancer treatments and preventive interventions for gastric cancer, assessment of cancer biomarkers, and AIDS epidemiology. Dr. Gail&rsquo;s current research focuses on statistical methods for the design and analysis of epidemiologic studies, including studies of genetic factors, and models to predict the absolute risk of disease.    Dr. Gail is a Fellow and former President of the American Statistical Association, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. He received the Spiegelman Award from the American Public Health Association, the Snedecor Award from the American Statistical Association, the Marvin Zelen Leadership Award in Statistical Science, and the Nathan Mantel Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Statistical Association.       TOPIC: Econometrics Seminar: Point process modelling for directed interaction networks SPEAKER: Patrick Perry (NYU) DATE: Friday, December 13, 2013 TIME: 3:00-4:00PM PLACE: 19 West 4th Street, Room 736    Summary . Network data often take the form of repeated interactions between senders and receivers tabulated over time. A primary question to ask of such data is which traits and behaviours are predictive of interaction. To answer this question, a model is introduced for treat- ing directed interactions as a multivariate point process: a Cox multiplicative intensity model using covariates that depend on the history of the process. Consistency and asymptotic nor- mality are proved for the resulting partial-likelihood-based estimators under suitable regularity conditions, and an efficient fitting procedure is described. Multicast interactions&mdash;those involving a single sender but multiple receivers&mdash;are treated explicitly. The resulting inferential framework is then employed to model message sending behaviour in a corporate e-mail network. The anal- ysis gives a precise quantification of which static shared traits and dynamic network effects are predictive of message recipient selection.       Wednesday, October 23rd, 2013, 2:00pm    NYU Stern School of Business Department of Information, Operations &amp; Management Sciences IOMS Distinguished Seminar Series    TOPIC: Wiki Surveys: Open and Quantifiable Social Data Collection    SPEAKER: Matthew Salganik (Princeton University)    DATE: Wednesday, October 23 TIME: 2:00 PM &ndash; 3:00PM PLACE: KMC 2-70    ABSTRACT    Research about attitudes and opinions is central to social science and relies on two common methodological approaches: surveys and interviews. While surveys enable the quantification of large amounts of information quickly and at a reasonable cost, they are routinely criticized for being \"top-down\" and rigid. In contrast, interviews allow unanticipated information to \"bubble up\" directly from respondents, but are slow, expensive, and difficult to quantify. Advances in computing technology now enable a hybrid approach that combines the quantifiability of a survey and the openness of an interview; we call this new class of data collection tools wiki surveys. Drawing on principles underlying successful information aggregation projects, such as Wikipedia, we propose three general criteria that wiki surveys should satisfy: they should be greedy, collaborative, and adaptive. We then present results from www.allourideas.org , a free and open-source website we created that enables groups all over the world to deploy wiki surveys. To date, more than 3,500 wiki surveys have been created, and they have collected over 175,000 ideas and 4.5 million votes. We describe the methodological challenges involved in collecting and analyzing this type of data and present a case study of a wiki survey created by the New York City Mayor's Office.

Gerald Corrigan Conference Center | Lowenstein Center 113 W. 60th St. | Lincoln Center Campus | Fordham University | NYC    Measurement is fundamental to good science. But progress in behavioral science theory building has not been very rapid. Nesselroade will examine selected aspects of current measurement practices, including the heavy reliance on standardized measurement in a field where important concepts often cannot be directly measured. He will sketch a possible remedy and speculate on its implications for measurement in future behavioral research. John R. Nesselroade earned his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1967. He is a past-president of Division 20 (Adult Development and Aging) of the American Psychological Association (1982-83) and of the Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology (1999-2000), and has received numerous awards and recognitions for his research.

For example, both text and web-browser data can be treated in this way. We can then look at how cell-counts for explanatory variables change with the response, and use the relationship to build scores for predicting future response.

He focuses on using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to fit models to data sets that arrive in small chunks, discussing some basic implementation issues and demonstrating the effectiveness of SGD for problems like linear and logistic regression as well as matrix factorization. He also describes how these methods allow ML systems to adapt to user data in real-time. This talk was recorded at the New York Open Statistical Programming meetup at Knewton.

Baker Julius and Rosa Sachs Distinguished Lecturer Columbia University Teachers College    WHEN: Friday, March 1st, 11am WHERE: CREATE Lab, 196 Mercer St., 8th Floor    ABSTRACT In recent years, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have become an increasingly common part of American mathematics and science education. One feature that has supported this development is the student models within intelligent tutors, which have become increasingly accurate at detecting whether a student knows a skill at a given time. From a science of learning perspective, it can be equally important to know when and within which contexts learning occurs.    In this talk, I present a machine-learned model that assesses the probability that a student learned a skill at a specific learning opportunity. This model can be used to analyze which skills are learned through insight and \"eureka\" moments, and which skills are learned more gradually. I also discuss how the pattern of learning over time can be used to predict not just which students learn, and when they learn, but how robust a student's learning will be.
