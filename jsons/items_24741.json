He shares the prize with John Lott, a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.   Kleiner and Lott were recognized for their explication of Grigori Perelman\u2019s solution of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, which is a century-old theorem explaining three-dimensional spheres. In 2002 and 2003, Perelman, a Russian mathematician, presented a proof that claimed to solve the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture. But many mathematicians had difficulty deciphering his work, presented over three papers, thereby raising questions about the proof\u2019s viability.   Kleiner and Lott set out to make Perelman\u2019s work transparent by first understanding, then explaining, the proof in greater detail.   \u201cThe Kleiner/Lott presentation was instrumental in making the solution accessible to the mathematical community, and, as the first detailed scientific presentation, played a crucial role in the verification of the solution,\u201d the academy said in announcing its selection.   The award, which includes a cash prize of $10,000, honors authors whose reviews have synthesized extensive and difficult material, providing a significant service to science and influencing the course of scientific thought. The prize annually rotates the discipline it recognizes; work in the field of mathematics is spotlighted once every 17 years.&amp;nbsp;       Courant Institute\u2019s Andrew Majda Receives Applied Mathematics Prize     Andrew Majda (right), a professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, received the 2013 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics, an award sponsored by the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.   The Wiener Prize is awarded every three years to recognize outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. The prize was given in January at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego.   The Samuel F.B. Morse Professor of Arts and Sciences at the Courant Institute, Majda is well-known for his theoretical contributions to partial differential equations and his applied contributions to a range of areas, including shock waves, combustion, and atmosphere ocean science.   Majda was recognized for \u201chis groundbreaking work in theoretical fluid mechanics and its application to problems in atmospheric science and oceanography,\u201d the prize citation states. &amp;nbsp;\u201cMathematicians and geophysicists alike have embraced Majda\u2019s pioneering advances on important and recalcitrant issues arising in climate modeling and prediction. This work includes the development and exploitation of the methods of statistical physics in geophysical problems, as well as the multi-scale analysis of moist fluid dynamics in the atmosphere.\u201d   A member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Majda has received numerous honors and awards, including the National Academy of Sciences Prize in Applied Mathematics, the John von Neumann Prize of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Gibbs Prize of the American Mathematical Society.&amp;nbsp;     Professor Tom Bishop Honored by the French Government     Tom Bishop (left), the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and the director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU, was presented with the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d in the Order of Arts and Letters by Antonin Baudry, the cultural counselor of the French Embassy, at a ceremony held this winter in NYU\u2019s La Maison Fran\u00e7aise.   The order\u2019s highest rank, the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d recognizes significant contributions to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance.   In his remarks, Baudry noted that Bishop played a key role in furthering the intellectual friendship between France and the U.S., and that he is credited with creating one of the best French departments in the United States, a department he headed for 40 years.&amp;nbsp;     High School Students Working With Psychology\u2019s Denis Pelli Named INTEL Semifinalists   Two high school students who worked on research projects in the laboratory of NYU psychology professor&amp;nbsp;Denis Pelli&amp;nbsp;were among the 300 national semifinalists for the international INTEL Science Talent Search competition for 2013.   These students, Carolyn Yao and Zofii Kaczmarek, both at New York City\u2019s Stuyvesant High School, conducted research projects on perception in Pelli\u2019s laboratory at NYU.   Semifinalists were selected from more than 1,700 entrants at 190 high schools in more than 30 states and one American high school overseas.   Yao explored how the number of visual features used in word identification grows with the number of possible words. She used a theoretical model to analyze the way human accuracy increases with duration. Fitting the model yielded an estimate of the number of features that her observers used to identify words. In doing so, she found a logarithmic relationship between the number of features used and the vocabulary size. Thus, vocabulary size, not word size, limits reading speed.   Kaczmarek examined why spaces between words increase reading speed. Classic Greek and Roman texts had no spaces, but all modern languages do. Using English text, she replaced the spaces with various letter and symbol combinations to test two hypotheses about the function of spaces in text. She found that spaces help because they relieve crowding between letters, rather than because they guide eye movements.   In 2012, four high school students working on science fair research projects with scientists at NYU\u2019s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology were among the national semifinalists for the INTEL Science Talent Search competition. These students worked on a range of projects, including plant nutrient dynamics, protein structure prediction, nema- tode genomics, and bacterial spore development.&amp;nbsp;       NYU-Poly\u2019s Nikhil Gupta Honored by the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society   Nikhil Gupta (right), an associate professor of mechanical engineering at NYU-Poly, was given a Young Leader Professional Development Award from the Structural Materials Division of the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society, known as TMS. This organization encompasses the entire range of materials science and engineering, from minerals processing and primary metals production to basic research and the advanced applications of materials.   Gupta\u2019s recent research focuses on developing lightweight materials with high damage tolerance for helmets, body armor, and automobile structures\u2014work with enormous practical applications in both peacetime and on the battlefield.     In addition to fundamental research supported by federal agencies, he is currently working with several small companies on developing technologies and products such as lightweight composite automotive brake rotors that could significantly improve fuel economy and lightweight, blast-resistant materials for the military.&amp;nbsp;     NSF Awards NYU-Poly Team Grant to Advance Big Data Visualization and Analysis   The National Science Foundation awarded a team of NYU-Poly professors an $800,000, multi-year grant, supplemented by a $350,000 institutional cost share, for a project titled \u201cAcquisition of an Infrastructure for Prototyping Next-Generation Algorithms for Large-Scale Visualization, Data Processing, and Analysis.\u201d   The team includes Claudio Silva as principal investigator, and co-principal investigators Torsten Suel, John Iacono, Juliana Freire, and Huy Vo.   The project, acquiring an instrument for prototyping the next-generation algorithms for large-scale visualization, data processing, and analysis, facilitates the development and evaluation of next-generation algorithms and systems that leverage different hardware configurations.   The instrumentation supports projects in various domains; the computer science projects include dataflow architectures, theoretical models of computation, Web search, visualization, and data mining.   The application area research projects, which are being undertaken with external collaborators, relate to wildfire simulation, bird migration simulation, and climate science. The team plans to release the software developed as part of this project as open source, which carries potential for significant broader impact.

Micoli, postdoctoral program director of NYU\u2019s Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and Carol Shoshkes&amp;nbsp;Reiss, a professor in the Department of Biology and the Center for Neural Science at NYU, to enhance the training of biomedical graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to prepare them for a wide range of careers.   \u201cWe believe that creating a comprehensive training infrastructure and a defined career planning and exploration pathway will result in a more efficient, effective, and satisfying training experience,\u201d says Micoli. \u201cWe will transform the nature of scientific training at NYU from a one-size-fits-all approach into a tailored program that can be broadly applicable across institutions nationally.\u201d   The grant, totaling just under $2 million, is among the first given under NIH\u2019s Broadening Experience in Scientific Training awards program. It will fund the new NYU Scientific Training Enhancement Program (NYU-STEP), a partnership between NYU School of Medicine and NYU. The program will help prepare approximately 1,100 trainees, including postdoctoral scholars and PhD students, in the sciences for careers that extend beyond university campuses and into the for-profit industry, government, communication, and non-profit corporations.     Historian Wosh Recognized by Society of American Archivists   Peter Wosh, director of NYU\u2019s Archives and Public History program, received the 2013 Council Exemplary Service Award given by the Society of American Archivists (SAA).   \u201cThe award recognizes a special contribution to the archives profession, and especially to SAA,\u201d the organization said in its announcement.   Wosh, a professor in the Department of History, served as SAA Publications Editor from February 2007 through February 2013. During his tenure, 20 books were published by SAA and joint opportunities were pursued with allied publishers. Wosh also pursued collaborations with the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan to publish Campus Case Studies series and with Brigham Young University to publish The Interactive Archivist.     Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s James McBride Receives National Book Award   James McBride, distinguished writer in residence at NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, was awarded the National Book Award for Fiction for his Civil War-era novel, The Good Lord Bird&amp;nbsp;(Riverhead).   McBride\u2019s previous works include:   The Color of Water and Miracle at St. Anna, which Spike Lee (Tisch \u201982, Honorary \u201998) turned into a film of the same title, as well as Song Yet Sung, also set in the Civil War era.   In a cover page review of The Good Lord Bird for The New York Times Book Review, Baz Dreisinger wrote that aspects of the book \u201csignaled a new way of talking\u2014indeed joking\u2014about race in America today.\u201d       Hardware Security Researchers Take Top Honors   A doctoral student, an undergraduate student, and faculty members of NYU-Poly and NYU Abu Dhabi took top honors at the Conference on Computer and Communications Security, the premier annual event of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

Cybersecurity Researcher Joins the Ranks of the \u2018Brilliant\u2019   NYU-Poly\u2019s Justin Cappos joins an elite group of 10 young researchers named by Popular Science magazine as this year\u2019s \u201cBrilliant 10.\u201d Cappos, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering, was recognized primarily for his work on Seattle, a free open-source cloud computing system that allows anyone to experience the Internet from the perspective of any location around the globe. Although some users employ Seattle for content distribution or to circumvent censorship, it also provides a safe platform for students to experiment with cybersecurity, mobile devices, and the Web. A dozen universities around the world have already used Seattle in 45 classes, mainly to study networking and cybersecurity.       NYU-Poly Professor Honored for Contributions to Nonlinear Control Theory and Design   Zhong-Ping Jiang, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at NYU-Poly, has been named a fellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control in recognition of his fundamental contributions to nonlinear control theory and design and applications to underactuated mechanical, communications, and biological systems.   Jiang has recently shifted his research on the mathematics and feedback mechanisms behind control systems to emerging fields such as the smart electrical grid, intelligent transportation systems, social networks, and the smartest and most complex control system of all: the human brain. Working with neuroscientists and his students, he hopes to use the knowledge gained in researching mechanical systems to explain and relieve neurological diseases in which feedback is problematic, such as Parkinson\u2019s and schizophrenia. The National Science Foundation has been among the sponsors of his research into the broad scope of nonlinear dynamical systems and feedback control.   American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Awards Maurizio Porfiri   Maurizio Porfiri, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at NYU-Poly, has been given the ASME Dynamic Systems and Controls Division 2013 Outstanding Young Investigator Award for his contributions to biomimetic underwater robotics and collective dynamics of networked dynamical systems.   Porfiri\u2019s most widely known research centers on biomimetic robotic fish to aid the understanding of animal collective behavior. They may someday result in robots that could lead live fish away from dangerous areas. Beyond his fundamental contribution to this emerging domain of ethorobotics, Porfiri has made substantial contributions to the field of network theory, dynamical systems, and multiphysics modeling of complex systems.

He shares the prize with John Lott, a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.   Kleiner and Lott were recognized for their explication of Grigori Perelman\u2019s solution of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, which is a century-old theorem explaining three-dimensional spheres. In 2002 and 2003, Perelman, a Russian mathematician, presented a proof that claimed to solve the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture. But many mathematicians had difficulty deciphering his work, presented over three papers, thereby raising questions about the proof\u2019s viability.   Kleiner and Lott set out to make Perelman\u2019s work transparent by first understanding, then explaining, the proof in greater detail.   \u201cThe Kleiner/Lott presentation was instrumental in making the solution accessible to the mathematical community, and, as the first detailed scientific presentation, played a crucial role in the verification of the solution,\u201d the academy said in announcing its selection.   The award, which includes a cash prize of $10,000, honors authors whose reviews have synthesized extensive and difficult material, providing a significant service to science and influencing the course of scientific thought. The prize annually rotates the discipline it recognizes; work in the field of mathematics is spotlighted once every 17 years.&amp;nbsp;       Courant Institute\u2019s Andrew Majda Receives Applied Mathematics Prize     Andrew Majda (right), a professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, received the 2013 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics, an award sponsored by the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.   The Wiener Prize is awarded every three years to recognize outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. The prize was given in January at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego.   The Samuel F.B. Morse Professor of Arts and Sciences at the Courant Institute, Majda is well-known for his theoretical contributions to partial differential equations and his applied contributions to a range of areas, including shock waves, combustion, and atmosphere ocean science.   Majda was recognized for \u201chis groundbreaking work in theoretical fluid mechanics and its application to problems in atmospheric science and oceanography,\u201d the prize citation states. &amp;nbsp;\u201cMathematicians and geophysicists alike have embraced Majda\u2019s pioneering advances on important and recalcitrant issues arising in climate modeling and prediction. This work includes the development and exploitation of the methods of statistical physics in geophysical problems, as well as the multi-scale analysis of moist fluid dynamics in the atmosphere.\u201d   A member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Majda has received numerous honors and awards, including the National Academy of Sciences Prize in Applied Mathematics, the John von Neumann Prize of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Gibbs Prize of the American Mathematical Society.&amp;nbsp;     Professor Tom Bishop Honored by the French Government     Tom Bishop (left), the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and the director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU, was presented with the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d in the Order of Arts and Letters by Antonin Baudry, the cultural counselor of the French Embassy, at a ceremony held this winter in NYU\u2019s La Maison Fran\u00e7aise.   The order\u2019s highest rank, the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d recognizes significant contributions to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance.   In his remarks, Baudry noted that Bishop played a key role in furthering the intellectual friendship between France and the U.S., and that he is credited with creating one of the best French departments in the United States, a department he headed for 40 years.&amp;nbsp;     High School Students Working With Psychology\u2019s Denis Pelli Named INTEL Semifinalists   Two high school students who worked on research projects in the laboratory of NYU psychology professor&amp;nbsp;Denis Pelli&amp;nbsp;were among the 300 national semifinalists for the international INTEL Science Talent Search competition for 2013.   These students, Carolyn Yao and Zofii Kaczmarek, both at New York City\u2019s Stuyvesant High School, conducted research projects on perception in Pelli\u2019s laboratory at NYU.   Semifinalists were selected from more than 1,700 entrants at 190 high schools in more than 30 states and one American high school overseas.   Yao explored how the number of visual features used in word identification grows with the number of possible words. She used a theoretical model to analyze the way human accuracy increases with duration. Fitting the model yielded an estimate of the number of features that her observers used to identify words. In doing so, she found a logarithmic relationship between the number of features used and the vocabulary size. Thus, vocabulary size, not word size, limits reading speed.   Kaczmarek examined why spaces between words increase reading speed. Classic Greek and Roman texts had no spaces, but all modern languages do. Using English text, she replaced the spaces with various letter and symbol combinations to test two hypotheses about the function of spaces in text. She found that spaces help because they relieve crowding between letters, rather than because they guide eye movements.   In 2012, four high school students working on science fair research projects with scientists at NYU\u2019s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology were among the national semifinalists for the INTEL Science Talent Search competition. These students worked on a range of projects, including plant nutrient dynamics, protein structure prediction, nema- tode genomics, and bacterial spore development.&amp;nbsp;       NYU-Poly\u2019s Nikhil Gupta Honored by the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society   Nikhil Gupta (right), an associate professor of mechanical engineering at NYU-Poly, was given a Young Leader Professional Development Award from the Structural Materials Division of the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society, known as TMS. This organization encompasses the entire range of materials science and engineering, from minerals processing and primary metals production to basic research and the advanced applications of materials.   Gupta\u2019s recent research focuses on developing lightweight materials with high damage tolerance for helmets, body armor, and automobile structures\u2014work with enormous practical applications in both peacetime and on the battlefield.     In addition to fundamental research supported by federal agencies, he is currently working with several small companies on developing technologies and products such as lightweight composite automotive brake rotors that could significantly improve fuel economy and lightweight, blast-resistant materials for the military.&amp;nbsp;     NSF Awards NYU-Poly Team Grant to Advance Big Data Visualization and Analysis   The National Science Foundation awarded a team of NYU-Poly professors an $800,000, multi-year grant, supplemented by a $350,000 institutional cost share, for a project titled \u201cAcquisition of an Infrastructure for Prototyping Next-Generation Algorithms for Large-Scale Visualization, Data Processing, and Analysis.\u201d   The team includes Claudio Silva as principal investigator, and co-principal investigators Torsten Suel, John Iacono, Juliana Freire, and Huy Vo.

The award, now in its 29th year, recognizes outstanding contributions in vision and brain research.   Movshon, also a faculty member in the Department of Psychology, predicted and discovered the existence of neurons in the brain that enable global motion perception, which is at work when we process the complex visual scenes that surround us. \u201cI was looking for what I considered to be the holy grail,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one else had ever used perceptual evidence as the basis for a search for neurons involved in a higher-order stage of visual cortical analysis.\u201d     Courant\u2019s LeCun Recognized for Technological Breakthroughs in \u2018Deep Learning\u2019   Yann LeCun, a professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, has been named the recipient of the IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer&amp;nbsp;Award, which is given by the Computational Intelligence Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).   The award, which recognizes contributions to the field at least 15 years prior to the award, will be given to LeCun during the institute\u2019s 2014 World Congress on Computational Intelligence in Beijing in July.   LeCun is one of the leading scientists behind the recent surge of interest in \u201cdeep learning\u201d\u2014the latest development in artificial intelligence in which researchers aim to emulate humans\u2019 auditory and visual systems. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional networks, are used for a wide variety of applications\u2014including speech and image recognition\u2014by companies such as Google, NEC, Microsoft, IBM, and Baidu.   Earlier this year, LeCun became the founding director of NYU\u2019s Center for Data Science, a research and education institution focused on the automatic extraction of knowledge from data and on the application of massive data analysis to science, medicine, business, and government.     NIH Awards Grant for New NYU-Step Program Created to Bolster Biomedical Research Training   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded a five-year grant to Keith J. Micoli, postdoctoral program director of NYU\u2019s Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and Carol Shoshkes&amp;nbsp;Reiss, a professor in the Department of Biology and the Center for Neural Science at NYU, to enhance the training of biomedical graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to prepare them for a wide range of careers.   \u201cWe believe that creating a comprehensive training infrastructure and a defined career planning and exploration pathway will result in a more efficient, effective, and satisfying training experience,\u201d says Micoli. \u201cWe will transform the nature of scientific training at NYU from a one-size-fits-all approach into a tailored program that can be broadly applicable across institutions nationally.\u201d   The grant, totaling just under $2 million, is among the first given under NIH\u2019s Broadening Experience in Scientific Training awards program. It will fund the new NYU Scientific Training Enhancement Program (NYU-STEP), a partnership between NYU School of Medicine and NYU. The program will help prepare approximately 1,100 trainees, including postdoctoral scholars and PhD students, in the sciences for careers that extend beyond university campuses and into the for-profit industry, government, communication, and non-profit corporations.     Historian Wosh Recognized by Society of American Archivists   Peter Wosh, director of NYU\u2019s Archives and Public History program, received the 2013 Council Exemplary Service Award given by the Society of American Archivists (SAA).   \u201cThe award recognizes a special contribution to the archives profession, and especially to SAA,\u201d the organization said in its announcement.   Wosh, a professor in the Department of History, served as SAA Publications Editor from February 2007 through February 2013. During his tenure, 20 books were published by SAA and joint opportunities were pursued with allied publishers. Wosh also pursued collaborations with the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan to publish Campus Case Studies series and with Brigham Young University to publish The Interactive Archivist.     Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s James McBride Receives National Book Award   James McBride, distinguished writer in residence at NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, was awarded the National Book Award for Fiction for his Civil War-era novel, The Good Lord Bird&amp;nbsp;(Riverhead).

In a cover page review of The Good Lord Bird for The New York Times Book Review, Baz Dreisinger wrote that aspects of the book \u201csignaled a new way of talking\u2014indeed joking\u2014about race in America today.\u201d       Hardware Security Researchers Take Top Honors   A doctoral student, an undergraduate student, and faculty members of NYU-Poly and NYU Abu Dhabi took top honors at the Conference on Computer and Communications Security, the premier annual event of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Their paper was chosen from among 530 submissions for the Best Student Paper Award.   The team, comprised of NYU-Poly doctoral candidate Jeyavijayan (JV)   Rajendran, undergraduate student   Michael Sam, NYU Abu Dhabi assistant professor of computer engineering Ozgur Sinanoglu, and NYU-Poly professor of electrical and computer engineering Ramesh Karri, presented their paper, \u201cSecurity Analysis of Integrated Circuit Camouflaging,\u201d at the ACM conference in Berlin in early November.     Cybersecurity Researcher Joins the Ranks of the \u2018Brilliant\u2019   NYU-Poly\u2019s Justin Cappos joins an elite group of 10 young researchers named by Popular Science magazine as this year\u2019s \u201cBrilliant 10.\u201d Cappos, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering, was recognized primarily for his work on Seattle, a free open-source cloud computing system that allows anyone to experience the Internet from the perspective of any location around the globe. Although some users employ Seattle for content distribution or to circumvent censorship, it also provides a safe platform for students to experiment with cybersecurity, mobile devices, and the Web. A dozen universities around the world have already used Seattle in 45 classes, mainly to study networking and cybersecurity.       NYU-Poly Professor Honored for Contributions to Nonlinear Control Theory and Design   Zhong-Ping Jiang, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at NYU-Poly, has been named a fellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control in recognition of his fundamental contributions to nonlinear control theory and design and applications to underactuated mechanical, communications, and biological systems.   Jiang has recently shifted his research on the mathematics and feedback mechanisms behind control systems to emerging fields such as the smart electrical grid, intelligent transportation systems, social networks, and the smartest and most complex control system of all: the human brain. Working with neuroscientists and his students, he hopes to use the knowledge gained in researching mechanical systems to explain and relieve neurological diseases in which feedback is problematic, such as Parkinson\u2019s and schizophrenia. The National Science Foundation has been among the sponsors of his research into the broad scope of nonlinear dynamical systems and feedback control.   American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Awards Maurizio Porfiri   Maurizio Porfiri, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at NYU-Poly, has been given the ASME Dynamic Systems and Controls Division 2013 Outstanding Young Investigator Award for his contributions to biomimetic underwater robotics and collective dynamics of networked dynamical systems.   Porfiri\u2019s most widely known research centers on biomimetic robotic fish to aid the understanding of animal collective behavior. They may someday result in robots that could lead live fish away from dangerous areas. Beyond his fundamental contribution to this emerging domain of ethorobotics, Porfiri has made substantial contributions to the field of network theory, dynamical systems, and multiphysics modeling of complex systems.

Anthony Movshon, director of NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science, was named the recipient of Minerva Foundation\u2019s 2013 Golden Brain Award \u201cfor his foundational contributions to the field of visual neuroscience,\u201d the organization said in announcing the honor.   The award, now in its 29th year, recognizes outstanding contributions in vision and brain research.   Movshon, also a faculty member in the Department of Psychology, predicted and discovered the existence of neurons in the brain that enable global motion perception, which is at work when we process the complex visual scenes that surround us. \u201cI was looking for what I considered to be the holy grail,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one else had ever used perceptual evidence as the basis for a search for neurons involved in a higher-order stage of visual cortical analysis.\u201d     Courant\u2019s LeCun Recognized for Technological Breakthroughs in \u2018Deep Learning\u2019   Yann LeCun, a professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, has been named the recipient of the IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer&amp;nbsp;Award, which is given by the Computational Intelligence Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).   The award, which recognizes contributions to the field at least 15 years prior to the award, will be given to LeCun during the institute\u2019s 2014 World Congress on Computational Intelligence in Beijing in July.   LeCun is one of the leading scientists behind the recent surge of interest in \u201cdeep learning\u201d\u2014the latest development in artificial intelligence in which researchers aim to emulate humans\u2019 auditory and visual systems. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional networks, are used for a wide variety of applications\u2014including speech and image recognition\u2014by companies such as Google, NEC, Microsoft, IBM, and Baidu.   Earlier this year, LeCun became the founding director of NYU\u2019s Center for Data Science, a research and education institution focused on the automatic extraction of knowledge from data and on the application of massive data analysis to science, medicine, business, and government.     NIH Awards Grant for New NYU-Step Program Created to Bolster Biomedical Research Training   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded a five-year grant to Keith J. Micoli, postdoctoral program director of NYU\u2019s Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and Carol Shoshkes&amp;nbsp;Reiss, a professor in the Department of Biology and the Center for Neural Science at NYU, to enhance the training of biomedical graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to prepare them for a wide range of careers.   \u201cWe believe that creating a comprehensive training infrastructure and a defined career planning and exploration pathway will result in a more efficient, effective, and satisfying training experience,\u201d says Micoli. \u201cWe will transform the nature of scientific training at NYU from a one-size-fits-all approach into a tailored program that can be broadly applicable across institutions nationally.\u201d   The grant, totaling just under $2 million, is among the first given under NIH\u2019s Broadening Experience in Scientific Training awards program. It will fund the new NYU Scientific Training Enhancement Program (NYU-STEP), a partnership between NYU School of Medicine and NYU. The program will help prepare approximately 1,100 trainees, including postdoctoral scholars and PhD students, in the sciences for careers that extend beyond university campuses and into the for-profit industry, government, communication, and non-profit corporations.     Historian Wosh Recognized by Society of American Archivists   Peter Wosh, director of NYU\u2019s Archives and Public History program, received the 2013 Council Exemplary Service Award given by the Society of American Archivists (SAA).   \u201cThe award recognizes a special contribution to the archives profession, and especially to SAA,\u201d the organization said in its announcement.   Wosh, a professor in the Department of History, served as SAA Publications Editor from February 2007 through February 2013. During his tenure, 20 books were published by SAA and joint opportunities were pursued with allied publishers. Wosh also pursued collaborations with the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan to publish Campus Case Studies series and with Brigham Young University to publish The Interactive Archivist.     Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s James McBride Receives National Book Award   James McBride, distinguished writer in residence at NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, was awarded the National Book Award for Fiction for his Civil War-era novel, The Good Lord Bird&amp;nbsp;(Riverhead).   McBride\u2019s previous works include:   The Color of Water and Miracle at St. Anna, which Spike Lee (Tisch \u201982, Honorary \u201998) turned into a film of the same title, as well as Song Yet Sung, also set in the Civil War era.   In a cover page review of The Good Lord Bird for The New York Times Book Review, Baz Dreisinger wrote that aspects of the book \u201csignaled a new way of talking\u2014indeed joking\u2014about race in America today.\u201d       Hardware Security Researchers Take Top Honors   A doctoral student, an undergraduate student, and faculty members of NYU-Poly and NYU Abu Dhabi took top honors at the Conference on Computer and Communications Security, the premier annual event of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Their paper was chosen from among 530 submissions for the Best Student Paper Award.   The team, comprised of NYU-Poly doctoral candidate Jeyavijayan (JV)   Rajendran, undergraduate student   Michael Sam, NYU Abu Dhabi assistant professor of computer engineering Ozgur Sinanoglu, and NYU-Poly professor of electrical and computer engineering Ramesh Karri, presented their paper, \u201cSecurity Analysis of Integrated Circuit Camouflaging,\u201d at the ACM conference in Berlin in early November.     Cybersecurity Researcher Joins the Ranks of the \u2018Brilliant\u2019   NYU-Poly\u2019s Justin Cappos joins an elite group of 10 young researchers named by Popular Science magazine as this year\u2019s \u201cBrilliant 10.\u201d Cappos, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering, was recognized primarily for his work on Seattle, a free open-source cloud computing system that allows anyone to experience the Internet from the perspective of any location around the globe. Although some users employ Seattle for content distribution or to circumvent censorship, it also provides a safe platform for students to experiment with cybersecurity, mobile devices, and the Web. A dozen universities around the world have already used Seattle in 45 classes, mainly to study networking and cybersecurity.       NYU-Poly Professor Honored for Contributions to Nonlinear Control Theory and Design   Zhong-Ping Jiang, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at NYU-Poly, has been named a fellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control in recognition of his fundamental contributions to nonlinear control theory and design and applications to underactuated mechanical, communications, and biological systems.   Jiang has recently shifted his research on the mathematics and feedback mechanisms behind control systems to emerging fields such as the smart electrical grid, intelligent transportation systems, social networks, and the smartest and most complex control system of all: the human brain. Working with neuroscientists and his students, he hopes to use the knowledge gained in researching mechanical systems to explain and relieve neurological diseases in which feedback is problematic, such as Parkinson\u2019s and schizophrenia. The National Science Foundation has been among the sponsors of his research into the broad scope of nonlinear dynamical systems and feedback control.   American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Awards Maurizio Porfiri   Maurizio Porfiri, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at NYU-Poly, has been given the ASME Dynamic Systems and Controls Division 2013 Outstanding Young Investigator Award for his contributions to biomimetic underwater robotics and collective dynamics of networked dynamical systems.   Porfiri\u2019s most widely known research centers on biomimetic robotic fish to aid the understanding of animal collective behavior. They may someday result in robots that could lead live fish away from dangerous areas. Beyond his fundamental contribution to this emerging domain of ethorobotics, Porfiri has made substantial contributions to the field of network theory, dynamical systems, and multiphysics modeling of complex systems.

He shares the prize with John Lott, a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.   Kleiner and Lott were recognized for their explication of Grigori Perelman\u2019s solution of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, which is a century-old theorem explaining three-dimensional spheres. In 2002 and 2003, Perelman, a Russian mathematician, presented a proof that claimed to solve the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture. But many mathematicians had difficulty deciphering his work, presented over three papers, thereby raising questions about the proof\u2019s viability.   Kleiner and Lott set out to make Perelman\u2019s work transparent by first understanding, then explaining, the proof in greater detail.   \u201cThe Kleiner/Lott presentation was instrumental in making the solution accessible to the mathematical community, and, as the first detailed scientific presentation, played a crucial role in the verification of the solution,\u201d the academy said in announcing its selection.   The award, which includes a cash prize of $10,000, honors authors whose reviews have synthesized extensive and difficult material, providing a significant service to science and influencing the course of scientific thought. The prize annually rotates the discipline it recognizes; work in the field of mathematics is spotlighted once every 17 years.&amp;nbsp;       Courant Institute\u2019s Andrew Majda Receives Applied Mathematics Prize     Andrew Majda (right), a professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, received the 2013 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics, an award sponsored by the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.   The Wiener Prize is awarded every three years to recognize outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. The prize was given in January at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego.   The Samuel F.B. Morse Professor of Arts and Sciences at the Courant Institute, Majda is well-known for his theoretical contributions to partial differential equations and his applied contributions to a range of areas, including shock waves, combustion, and atmosphere ocean science.   Majda was recognized for \u201chis groundbreaking work in theoretical fluid mechanics and its application to problems in atmospheric science and oceanography,\u201d the prize citation states. &amp;nbsp;\u201cMathematicians and geophysicists alike have embraced Majda\u2019s pioneering advances on important and recalcitrant issues arising in climate modeling and prediction. This work includes the development and exploitation of the methods of statistical physics in geophysical problems, as well as the multi-scale analysis of moist fluid dynamics in the atmosphere.\u201d   A member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Majda has received numerous honors and awards, including the National Academy of Sciences Prize in Applied Mathematics, the John von Neumann Prize of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Gibbs Prize of the American Mathematical Society.&amp;nbsp;     Professor Tom Bishop Honored by the French Government     Tom Bishop (left), the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and the director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU, was presented with the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d in the Order of Arts and Letters by Antonin Baudry, the cultural counselor of the French Embassy, at a ceremony held this winter in NYU\u2019s La Maison Fran\u00e7aise.   The order\u2019s highest rank, the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d recognizes significant contributions to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance.   In his remarks, Baudry noted that Bishop played a key role in furthering the intellectual friendship between France and the U.S., and that he is credited with creating one of the best French departments in the United States, a department he headed for 40 years.&amp;nbsp;     High School Students Working With Psychology\u2019s Denis Pelli Named INTEL Semifinalists   Two high school students who worked on research projects in the laboratory of NYU psychology professor&amp;nbsp;Denis Pelli&amp;nbsp;were among the 300 national semifinalists for the international INTEL Science Talent Search competition for 2013.   These students, Carolyn Yao and Zofii Kaczmarek, both at New York City\u2019s Stuyvesant High School, conducted research projects on perception in Pelli\u2019s laboratory at NYU.   Semifinalists were selected from more than 1,700 entrants at 190 high schools in more than 30 states and one American high school overseas.   Yao explored how the number of visual features used in word identification grows with the number of possible words. She used a theoretical model to analyze the way human accuracy increases with duration. Fitting the model yielded an estimate of the number of features that her observers used to identify words. In doing so, she found a logarithmic relationship between the number of features used and the vocabulary size. Thus, vocabulary size, not word size, limits reading speed.   Kaczmarek examined why spaces between words increase reading speed. Classic Greek and Roman texts had no spaces, but all modern languages do. Using English text, she replaced the spaces with various letter and symbol combinations to test two hypotheses about the function of spaces in text. She found that spaces help because they relieve crowding between letters, rather than because they guide eye movements.   In 2012, four high school students working on science fair research projects with scientists at NYU\u2019s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology were among the national semifinalists for the INTEL Science Talent Search competition. These students worked on a range of projects, including plant nutrient dynamics, protein structure prediction, nema- tode genomics, and bacterial spore development.&amp;nbsp;       NYU-Poly\u2019s Nikhil Gupta Honored by the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society   Nikhil Gupta (right), an associate professor of mechanical engineering at NYU-Poly, was given a Young Leader Professional Development Award from the Structural Materials Division of the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society, known as TMS. This organization encompasses the entire range of materials science and engineering, from minerals processing and primary metals production to basic research and the advanced applications of materials.   Gupta\u2019s recent research focuses on developing lightweight materials with high damage tolerance for helmets, body armor, and automobile structures\u2014work with enormous practical applications in both peacetime and on the battlefield.     In addition to fundamental research supported by federal agencies, he is currently working with several small companies on developing technologies and products such as lightweight composite automotive brake rotors that could significantly improve fuel economy and lightweight, blast-resistant materials for the military.&amp;nbsp;     NSF Awards NYU-Poly Team Grant to Advance Big Data Visualization and Analysis   The National Science Foundation awarded a team of NYU-Poly professors an $800,000, multi-year grant, supplemented by a $350,000 institutional cost share, for a project titled \u201cAcquisition of an Infrastructure for Prototyping Next-Generation Algorithms for Large-Scale Visualization, Data Processing, and Analysis.\u201d   The team includes Claudio Silva as principal investigator, and co-principal investigators Torsten Suel, John Iacono, Juliana Freire, and Huy Vo.   The project, acquiring an instrument for prototyping the next-generation algorithms for large-scale visualization, data processing, and analysis, facilitates the development and evaluation of next-generation algorithms and systems that leverage different hardware configurations.   The instrumentation supports projects in various domains; the computer science projects include dataflow architectures, theoretical models of computation, Web search, visualization, and data mining.   The application area research projects, which are being undertaken with external collaborators, relate to wildfire simulation, bird migration simulation, and climate science. The team plans to release the software developed as part of this project as open source, which carries potential for significant broader impact.

Anthony Movshon, director of NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science, was named the recipient of Minerva Foundation\u2019s 2013 Golden Brain Award \u201cfor his foundational contributions to the field of visual neuroscience,\u201d the organization said in announcing the honor.   The award, now in its 29th year, recognizes outstanding contributions in vision and brain research.   Movshon, also a faculty member in the Department of Psychology, predicted and discovered the existence of neurons in the brain that enable global motion perception, which is at work when we process the complex visual scenes that surround us. \u201cI was looking for what I considered to be the holy grail,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one else had ever used perceptual evidence as the basis for a search for neurons involved in a higher-order stage of visual cortical analysis.\u201d     Courant\u2019s LeCun Recognized for Technological Breakthroughs in \u2018Deep Learning\u2019   Yann LeCun, a professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, has been named the recipient of the IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer&amp;nbsp;Award, which is given by the Computational Intelligence Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).   The award, which recognizes contributions to the field at least 15 years prior to the award, will be given to LeCun during the institute\u2019s 2014 World Congress on Computational Intelligence in Beijing in July.   LeCun is one of the leading scientists behind the recent surge of interest in \u201cdeep learning\u201d\u2014the latest development in artificial intelligence in which researchers aim to emulate humans\u2019 auditory and visual systems. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional networks, are used for a wide variety of applications\u2014including speech and image recognition\u2014by companies such as Google, NEC, Microsoft, IBM, and Baidu.   Earlier this year, LeCun became the founding director of NYU\u2019s Center for Data Science, a research and education institution focused on the automatic extraction of knowledge from data and on the application of massive data analysis to science, medicine, business, and government.

Micoli, postdoctoral program director of NYU\u2019s Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, and Carol Shoshkes&amp;nbsp;Reiss, a professor in the Department of Biology and the Center for Neural Science at NYU, to enhance the training of biomedical graduate students and postdoctoral scholars to prepare them for a wide range of careers.   \u201cWe believe that creating a comprehensive training infrastructure and a defined career planning and exploration pathway will result in a more efficient, effective, and satisfying training experience,\u201d says Micoli. \u201cWe will transform the nature of scientific training at NYU from a one-size-fits-all approach into a tailored program that can be broadly applicable across institutions nationally.\u201d   The grant, totaling just under $2 million, is among the first given under NIH\u2019s Broadening Experience in Scientific Training awards program. It will fund the new NYU Scientific Training Enhancement Program (NYU-STEP), a partnership between NYU School of Medicine and NYU. The program will help prepare approximately 1,100 trainees, including postdoctoral scholars and PhD students, in the sciences for careers that extend beyond university campuses and into the for-profit industry, government, communication, and non-profit corporations.     Historian Wosh Recognized by Society of American Archivists   Peter Wosh, director of NYU\u2019s Archives and Public History program, received the 2013 Council Exemplary Service Award given by the Society of American Archivists (SAA).   \u201cThe award recognizes a special contribution to the archives profession, and especially to SAA,\u201d the organization said in its announcement.   Wosh, a professor in the Department of History, served as SAA Publications Editor from February 2007 through February 2013. During his tenure, 20 books were published by SAA and joint opportunities were pursued with allied publishers. Wosh also pursued collaborations with the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan to publish Campus Case Studies series and with Brigham Young University to publish The Interactive Archivist.     Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s James McBride Receives National Book Award   James McBride, distinguished writer in residence at NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, was awarded the National Book Award for Fiction for his Civil War-era novel, The Good Lord Bird&amp;nbsp;(Riverhead).   McBride\u2019s previous works include:   The Color of Water and Miracle at St. Anna, which Spike Lee (Tisch \u201982, Honorary \u201998) turned into a film of the same title, as well as Song Yet Sung, also set in the Civil War era.   In a cover page review of The Good Lord Bird for The New York Times Book Review, Baz Dreisinger wrote that aspects of the book \u201csignaled a new way of talking\u2014indeed joking\u2014about race in America today.\u201d       Hardware Security Researchers Take Top Honors   A doctoral student, an undergraduate student, and faculty members of NYU-Poly and NYU Abu Dhabi took top honors at the Conference on Computer and Communications Security, the premier annual event of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit, and Control of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

The team, comprised of NYU-Poly doctoral candidate Jeyavijayan (JV)   Rajendran, undergraduate student   Michael Sam, NYU Abu Dhabi assistant professor of computer engineering Ozgur Sinanoglu, and NYU-Poly professor of electrical and computer engineering Ramesh Karri, presented their paper, \u201cSecurity Analysis of Integrated Circuit Camouflaging,\u201d at the ACM conference in Berlin in early November.     Cybersecurity Researcher Joins the Ranks of the \u2018Brilliant\u2019   NYU-Poly\u2019s Justin Cappos joins an elite group of 10 young researchers named by Popular Science magazine as this year\u2019s \u201cBrilliant 10.\u201d Cappos, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering, was recognized primarily for his work on Seattle, a free open-source cloud computing system that allows anyone to experience the Internet from the perspective of any location around the globe. Although some users employ Seattle for content distribution or to circumvent censorship, it also provides a safe platform for students to experiment with cybersecurity, mobile devices, and the Web. A dozen universities around the world have already used Seattle in 45 classes, mainly to study networking and cybersecurity.       NYU-Poly Professor Honored for Contributions to Nonlinear Control Theory and Design   Zhong-Ping Jiang, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at NYU-Poly, has been named a fellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control in recognition of his fundamental contributions to nonlinear control theory and design and applications to underactuated mechanical, communications, and biological systems.   Jiang has recently shifted his research on the mathematics and feedback mechanisms behind control systems to emerging fields such as the smart electrical grid, intelligent transportation systems, social networks, and the smartest and most complex control system of all: the human brain. Working with neuroscientists and his students, he hopes to use the knowledge gained in researching mechanical systems to explain and relieve neurological diseases in which feedback is problematic, such as Parkinson\u2019s and schizophrenia. The National Science Foundation has been among the sponsors of his research into the broad scope of nonlinear dynamical systems and feedback control.   American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Awards Maurizio Porfiri   Maurizio Porfiri, an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at NYU-Poly, has been given the ASME Dynamic Systems and Controls Division 2013 Outstanding Young Investigator Award for his contributions to biomimetic underwater robotics and collective dynamics of networked dynamical systems.   Porfiri\u2019s most widely known research centers on biomimetic robotic fish to aid the understanding of animal collective behavior. They may someday result in robots that could lead live fish away from dangerous areas. Beyond his fundamental contribution to this emerging domain of ethorobotics, Porfiri has made substantial contributions to the field of network theory, dynamical systems, and multiphysics modeling of complex systems.

He shares the prize with John Lott, a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.   Kleiner and Lott were recognized for their explication of Grigori Perelman\u2019s solution of the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, which is a century-old theorem explaining three-dimensional spheres. In 2002 and 2003, Perelman, a Russian mathematician, presented a proof that claimed to solve the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture. But many mathematicians had difficulty deciphering his work, presented over three papers, thereby raising questions about the proof\u2019s viability.   Kleiner and Lott set out to make Perelman\u2019s work transparent by first understanding, then explaining, the proof in greater detail.   \u201cThe Kleiner/Lott presentation was instrumental in making the solution accessible to the mathematical community, and, as the first detailed scientific presentation, played a crucial role in the verification of the solution,\u201d the academy said in announcing its selection.   The award, which includes a cash prize of $10,000, honors authors whose reviews have synthesized extensive and difficult material, providing a significant service to science and influencing the course of scientific thought. The prize annually rotates the discipline it recognizes; work in the field of mathematics is spotlighted once every 17 years.&amp;nbsp;       Courant Institute\u2019s Andrew Majda Receives Applied Mathematics Prize     Andrew Majda (right), a professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, received the 2013 Norbert Wiener Prize in Applied Mathematics, an award sponsored by the American Mathematical Society and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.   The Wiener Prize is awarded every three years to recognize outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. The prize was given in January at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego.   The Samuel F.B. Morse Professor of Arts and Sciences at the Courant Institute, Majda is well-known for his theoretical contributions to partial differential equations and his applied contributions to a range of areas, including shock waves, combustion, and atmosphere ocean science.   Majda was recognized for \u201chis groundbreaking work in theoretical fluid mechanics and its application to problems in atmospheric science and oceanography,\u201d the prize citation states. &amp;nbsp;\u201cMathematicians and geophysicists alike have embraced Majda\u2019s pioneering advances on important and recalcitrant issues arising in climate modeling and prediction. This work includes the development and exploitation of the methods of statistical physics in geophysical problems, as well as the multi-scale analysis of moist fluid dynamics in the atmosphere.\u201d   A member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Majda has received numerous honors and awards, including the National Academy of Sciences Prize in Applied Mathematics, the John von Neumann Prize of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Gibbs Prize of the American Mathematical Society.&amp;nbsp;     Professor Tom Bishop Honored by the French Government     Tom Bishop (left), the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and the director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU, was presented with the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d in the Order of Arts and Letters by Antonin Baudry, the cultural counselor of the French Embassy, at a ceremony held this winter in NYU\u2019s La Maison Fran\u00e7aise.   The order\u2019s highest rank, the insignia of \u201ccommander\u201d recognizes significant contributions to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance.   In his remarks, Baudry noted that Bishop played a key role in furthering the intellectual friendship between France and the U.S., and that he is credited with creating one of the best French departments in the United States, a department he headed for 40 years.&amp;nbsp;     High School Students Working With Psychology\u2019s Denis Pelli Named INTEL Semifinalists   Two high school students who worked on research projects in the laboratory of NYU psychology professor&amp;nbsp;Denis Pelli&amp;nbsp;were among the 300 national semifinalists for the international INTEL Science Talent Search competition for 2013.   These students, Carolyn Yao and Zofii Kaczmarek, both at New York City\u2019s Stuyvesant High School, conducted research projects on perception in Pelli\u2019s laboratory at NYU.   Semifinalists were selected from more than 1,700 entrants at 190 high schools in more than 30 states and one American high school overseas.   Yao explored how the number of visual features used in word identification grows with the number of possible words. She used a theoretical model to analyze the way human accuracy increases with duration. Fitting the model yielded an estimate of the number of features that her observers used to identify words. In doing so, she found a logarithmic relationship between the number of features used and the vocabulary size. Thus, vocabulary size, not word size, limits reading speed.   Kaczmarek examined why spaces between words increase reading speed. Classic Greek and Roman texts had no spaces, but all modern languages do. Using English text, she replaced the spaces with various letter and symbol combinations to test two hypotheses about the function of spaces in text. She found that spaces help because they relieve crowding between letters, rather than because they guide eye movements.   In 2012, four high school students working on science fair research projects with scientists at NYU\u2019s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology were among the national semifinalists for the INTEL Science Talent Search competition. These students worked on a range of projects, including plant nutrient dynamics, protein structure prediction, nema- tode genomics, and bacterial spore development.&amp;nbsp;       NYU-Poly\u2019s Nikhil Gupta Honored by the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society   Nikhil Gupta (right), an associate professor of mechanical engineering at NYU-Poly, was given a Young Leader Professional Development Award from the Structural Materials Division of the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society, known as TMS. This organization encompasses the entire range of materials science and engineering, from minerals processing and primary metals production to basic research and the advanced applications of materials.   Gupta\u2019s recent research focuses on developing lightweight materials with high damage tolerance for helmets, body armor, and automobile structures\u2014work with enormous practical applications in both peacetime and on the battlefield.     In addition to fundamental research supported by federal agencies, he is currently working with several small companies on developing technologies and products such as lightweight composite automotive brake rotors that could significantly improve fuel economy and lightweight, blast-resistant materials for the military.&amp;nbsp;     NSF Awards NYU-Poly Team Grant to Advance Big Data Visualization and Analysis   The National Science Foundation awarded a team of NYU-Poly professors an $800,000, multi-year grant, supplemented by a $350,000 institutional cost share, for a project titled \u201cAcquisition of an Infrastructure for Prototyping Next-Generation Algorithms for Large-Scale Visualization, Data Processing, and Analysis.\u201d   The team includes Claudio Silva as principal investigator, and co-principal investigators Torsten Suel, John Iacono, Juliana Freire, and Huy Vo.   The project, acquiring an instrument for prototyping the next-generation algorithms for large-scale visualization, data processing, and analysis, facilitates the development and evaluation of next-generation algorithms and systems that leverage different hardware configurations.   The instrumentation supports projects in various domains; the computer science projects include dataflow architectures, theoretical models of computation, Web search, visualization, and data mining.   The application area research projects, which are being undertaken with external collaborators, relate to wildfire simulation, bird migration simulation, and climate science. The team plans to release the software developed as part of this project as open source, which carries potential for significant broader impact.
