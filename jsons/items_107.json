Materials created or received by a person, family, or organization, public or private, in the conduct of their affairs and preserved because of the enduring value contained in the information they contain or as evidence of the functions and responsibilities of their creator, especially those materials maintained using the principles of provenance, original order, and collective control; permanent records. \u2013 2. The division within an organization responsible for maintaining the organization's records of enduring value. \u2013 3. An organization that collects the records of individuals, families, or other organizations; a collecting archives. \u2013 4. The professional discipline of administering such collections and organizations. \u2013 5. The building (or portion thereof) housing archival collections. \u2013 6. A published collection of scholarly papers, especially as a periodical.\" Richard Pearce-Moses. \" Archives .\" A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology. SAA, 2005.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This guide focuses on the first three definitions and specially excludes the sixth, with some necessary material on four and five. It is to help you identify and locate -- not necessarily in that order -- archival collections relevant to your research.\u00a0 It is not a list of recommended archives and users should keep in mind that archival practices vary widely.\u00a0 It is your responsibility as a researcher to understand and follow the specific guidelines and practices of the specific archive.\u00a0 Establishing a good working relationship with an archive is a very fruitful and rewarding process, and has long-term benefits for both the scholars and the archivists.\u00a0 Enjoy your research.

Sometimes it can be combination of the two. You should always remember that another source of archives is already published scholarship, where any archival collections should be listed in the bibliography. Dissertations often list archival collections as a specific section, so these can be extremely useful, especially for hard to locate collections (and institutions). Try searching in Dissertation Abstracts at http://arch.library.nyu.edu/databases/proxy/NYU00729 for U.S. dissertations of look at the Research Guide on Dissertations at http://nyu.libguides.com/dissertations.   In searching Bobcat you can always use the keyword subject search \"Archives Directories .\" If you add another term, a location for example, you can quickly limit the search. The trick is that not every possible term is used, and the third term may take out materials you would want to see, so fiddle with any additional subjects. For example, the search \"archives directories Jewish\" brings up three records, but does not bring up A Great Collection: The Archives of the Jewish Labor Movement because it does not have these three words in its subject headings.

The second is a union catalogue which only has those institutions contributing to it. There is overlap with the records in Archive Grid. Archive Finer lists many collections not in either WorldCat or ArchiveGrid.  Archive Finder * (Chadwyck Healey) Repositories may submit their information directly rather than through National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections or National Inventory of Documentary Sources in the United States. Offers keyword searching across all fields or in specific fields. ArchiveGrid Search nearly a million collection descriptions from thousands of libraries, museums, and archives. Researchers searching ArchiveGrid can learn about the many items in each of these collections, contact archives to arrange a visit to examine materials, and order copies. WorldCat (OCLC) Search for books and more in libraries in the U.S. and around the world. Indicates when NYU Libraries holds a copy of a book and shows you nearby libraries with holdings.

WAX Web Archive Collection Service - Harvard University Library \"The public interface for Harvard's new Web Archive Collection Service (WAX) launched on February 4, 2009. WAX began as a pilot project in July 2006, funded by the University's Library Digital Initiative (LDI) to address the management of web sites by collection managers for long-term archiving. It was the first LDI project specifically oriented toward preserving \"born-digital\" material. WAX has now transitioned to a production system supported by the University Library's central infrastructure. Collection managers, working in the online environment, must continue to acquire the content that they have always collected physically. With blogs supplanting diaries, e-mail supplanting traditional correspondence, and HTML materials supplanting many forms of print collateral, collection managers have grown increasingly concerned about potential gaps in the documentation of our cultural heritage.

For example, the search \"archives directories Jewish\" brings up three records, but does not bring up A Great Collection: The Archives of the Jewish Labor Movement because it does not have these three words in its subject headings.
