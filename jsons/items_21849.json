Led by the senior class and student members of the 1831 Fund Leadership Committee, NYU students ask their classmates to contribute $18.31 in honor of NYU\u2019s founding year. 100% of the funds raised are used to create scholarships for incoming freshmen and transfer students. President John Sexton and University Trustee H. Dale Hemmerdinger each direct a match to the 1831 Funds, so a contribution of $18.31 is tripled to become $54.93. Alumni, parents, and faculty and staff can partner with our students in this amazing community-building effort by making their own contributions to the 1831 Fund.

Given our selectivity, getting into NYU is difficult. But   for too many of our most deserving applicants and students,   another hurdle looms: being able to afford to come here. For each student with need\u2014and almost half of our undergraduates   are eligible for scholarship aid\u2014we do our best to build an award that adds our own grants to private and government   resources. And while NYU does provide an extraordinary amount of assistance, we are not able to meet the overall   financial needs of our students. Annually the gap is on the   order of $200&ndash;250 million.   That is why our ambitious goal for the Momentum   Campaign is to raise by 2017 $1 billion exclusively dedicated  to generating scholarships. Your partnership and participation is vitally important to help us meet this goal. New York   University stands ready to educate the leaders of the future. Your generosity will enable us to bring more of the world\u2019s   most talented young minds to the Washington Square campus and across our global network.   We need you to set in motion a campaign focused on   one goal: to unlock the potential and unleash the ambition   of talented men and women. We cannot think of a more   worthy endeavor.

New York University was founded in 1831 on an unconventional philosophy: to educate all outstanding New Yorkers, regardless of national origin, religion, or class. As NYU ascended into the elite tiers of higher education, we lifted thousands of deserving students with us. Historically, the University has been a \u201cschool of    opportunity,\u201d welcoming generations of first-in-the-family college graduates and providing immigrant and underprivileged families with a springboard for advancement.         NYU has experienced a period of unprecedented improvement in our position and rankings, demonstrated by the quality       of the faculty and students we continue to recruit and the         success of our worldwide alumni network. We have a greater       opportunity than ever before to educate the world\u2019s most promising students, many of whom have overcome remarkable challenges to arrive at NYU with their desire to excel\u2014if we         can offer them the financial means to do so. And we must.         With your help, we will have the resources to enable our         students to reach even greater heights.                Be Part of the Momentum   We look forward to working with you to tailor your gift in support of NYU\u2019s Momentum Campaign in the way that aligns best with your priorities.
