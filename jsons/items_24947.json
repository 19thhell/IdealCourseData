P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq.

Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.  FREN-UA 965 (conducted in French ) Topics in French Literature: Slavery in the Francophone World Prof. C\u00e9cile Bishop MW, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-19 #8726 Between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century, France was responsible for the kidnapping, forced transport and brutal enslavement of over a million Africans. This course examines representations of slavery in a wide range of media including literature, film and visual arts, from the late 18th century to the present day. In addition to exploring the role of slavery in shaping French and francophone cultures, students will develop new perspectives on the power and limits of literature and art in representing violence and suffering. Authors studied include Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Claire de Duras, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Maryse Cond\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 Schwarz-Bart and Patrick Chamoiseau. FREN-UA 865 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Culture: Paris in History, Art and Literature Prof. Olivier Berthe MW, 4:55pm \u2013 6:10pm 25 W. 4th St., C-9 #8267 The aim of this course is to help the student develop an intimate knowledge of France\u2019s capital city. Adopting a chronological approach, we will explore the different stages of Paris\u2019 development through the analysis of numerous historical and literary texts, maps, paintings, photographs and movies. In the process, we will journey through over 2000 years of French history, discovering major political, social and artistic events, and developing a vision of the organic growth of the city. (French majors must fill out a French Coursework Guarantee in order to receive credit towards their major requirements for this course.)  FREN-UA 883 (conducted in English) Cinema and Literature Prof. William Wolf W, 2:00pm \u2013 4:45pm Cantor 101 #6881 Exposes   the student to various modes, such as expressionism, social realism,   and the projection of the hero. One film is viewed per week and   analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and   poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media   and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these   media so often focus.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

In this course, attempt to develop a critical heuristic which maps the topoi of the socio-eco-techno system. Drawing on mediology, ethics, and the French school of the anthropology of techniques, we explore such topoi as a form of \u201cdeep\u201d historical sediment and also to understand how our values are negotiated and transformed via our on-going rapport with the technological.

This pragmatic approach will not only allow students to improve their pronunciation, but also to understand the poetic genre, the quality of poets\u2019 language, their interest in etymology, metaphor, imagery, etc. Close readings, paraphrase and translations will allow students to considerably improve their mastery of the French language so that they in turn will be able to produce poetry of their own. This course will help them to integrate the phonic, rhythmic and musical dimensions of poetry, as well as learn about its various uses, from the intimate to historical testimonies.

Writing Workshop: Writing Paris - FREN-UA 9968 - 2 points                               Given in the form of a workshop, this course allows students to improve their written expression through the study and practice of a variety of literary registers, mostly drawn from contemporary literature. The workshop associates literary creation and French language instruction with the firm belief that creative writing in French is possible for students at all levels. Its primary objective is the reinforcement of students\u2019 written competencies in French, accomplished through intensive writing sessions with the common theme of Paris. Students are invited to appropriate Paris through various writing activities, inspired by writers such as Baudelaire, Perec, or Modiano, designed to help students capture the city through its movements, its images, and its different facets. The regular practice of creative writing as well as systematic re-writing of all work will allow students to reinforce grammatical structures while expanding vocabulary. Conducted in French.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

In particular, we consider the French existentialists\u2019 concern for commitment in political and social affairs, and how this is reflected in \u201ctheatre of the absurd,\u201d in fiction, and in critical work of other contemporary French writers. Covers Ionesco, Beckett, Genet, Robbe-Grillet, and Barthes; precursors of the absurd such as Kafka and C\u00e9line; some consideration may be given in addition to practitioners of the absurd outside of France.

Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Between Fiction and Reality: New York and Paris - SOC-UA 9461 or SCA-UA 9624 - 4 points                                As major metropolises, Paris and New York are deeply engaged in processes of globalization: each has to stay competitive, to accumulate wealth, to hold on to its inhabitants as well as to attract tourists, business professionals, students, and immigrants. Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

In this course we will read poetry out loud in order to show how poetry is founded on rhythm and the repetition of phonetic and syntactic elements. This pragmatic approach will not only allow students to improve their pronunciation, but also to understand the poetic genre, the quality of poets\u2019 language, their interest in etymology, metaphor, imagery, etc. Close readings, paraphrase and translations will allow students to considerably improve their mastery of the French language so that they in turn will be able to produce poetry of their own. This course will help them to integrate the phonic, rhythmic and musical dimensions of poetry, as well as learn about its various uses, from the intimate to historical testimonies.

Writing Workshop: Writing Paris - FREN-UA 9968 - 2 points                               Given in the form of a workshop, this course allows students to improve their written expression through the study and practice of a variety of literary registers, mostly drawn from contemporary literature. The workshop associates literary creation and French language instruction with the firm belief that creative writing in French is possible for students at all levels. Its primary objective is the reinforcement of students\u2019 written competencies in French, accomplished through intensive writing sessions with the common theme of Paris. Students are invited to appropriate Paris through various writing activities, inspired by writers such as Baudelaire, Perec, or Modiano, designed to help students capture the city through its movements, its images, and its different facets. The regular practice of creative writing as well as systematic re-writing of all work will allow students to reinforce grammatical structures while expanding vocabulary. Conducted in French.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.                                                                        Existentialism and the Absurd - FREN-UA 9767 - 4 points                               This course explores the main expressions of existential thought in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus, as well as absurdist literature from the 1950s. In particular, we consider the French existentialists\u2019 concern for commitment in political and social affairs, and how this is reflected in \u201ctheatre of the absurd,\u201d in fiction, and in critical work of other contemporary French writers. Covers Ionesco, Beckett, Genet, Robbe-Grillet, and Barthes; precursors of the absurd such as Kafka and C\u00e9line; some consideration may be given in addition to practitioners of the absurd outside of France.

Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Beginning with an historical overview, we consider the category of \u2018woman\u2019 as it was defined from the Revolution to the founding of French feminism at the end of the 19th century. The second part of the course is devoted to an exploration of gender as a political issue during the past 20 years, through consideration of such topics as parit\u00e9, prostitution, colonialism, post-colonialism, and queer studies.

Between Fiction and Reality: New York and Paris - SOC-UA 9461 or SCA-UA 9624 - 4 points                                As major metropolises, Paris and New York are deeply engaged in processes of globalization: each has to stay competitive, to accumulate wealth, to hold on to its inhabitants as well as to attract tourists, business professionals, students, and immigrants. Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date.

Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose.

NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval).
