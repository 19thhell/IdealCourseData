The program offers a holistic approach to the study of humans and exposes students to the traditional subdisciplines of anthropology while ensuring that they also receive intensive training in particular problems within one subfield. Doctoral Program in Archaeology: Ancient Technologies in their Environmental Contexts Archaeologists in the department are committed to the   belief that the material remains of ancient societies provide   significant insights into the dynamics of sociocultural evolution. The   department has developed an archaeology program that focuses on key   transformations in cultural evolution; the origins of art and symbolism;   archeology and gender; the emergence of food production; and the   development and collapse of chieftaincies and early states.

Doctoral Program in Biological Anthropology The research and training program in our department   is distinguished by its unique commitment to integrating   laboratory-based and field-based research. We have state-of-the-art   laboratories in genetics and molecular systematics, and in   paleoanthropology, with superb facilities for both research and teaching   in these areas. In addition, faculty and students are conducting   primatological and paleoanthropological research at sites in South   America, Asia and Africa.   Click here for more information.  Masters Program in Biological Anthropology - Human Skeletal Biology This two year program prepares graduates to apply the principles and techniques of skeletal biology and genetic research in Biological Anthropology to a variety of contexts, including those in the Forensic Sciences (i.e., Medical Examiner\u2019s office, Coroner\u2019s office, Armed Forces, Criminal Justice, Law Enforcement, Mass Disasters). The program can also be useful training for students who are preparing for admission to doctoral programs in bioarchaeology, skeletal biology and human evolution. Program includes 36 points of coursework, a laboratory or field internship, and a research-based M.A. thesis. Click here for more information Doctoral Program in Sociocultural Anthropology Cultural anthropologists in the department share a   belief that study and research must be firmly grounded in rigorous   training in general social and cultural theory, both in contemporary   writings and in the classics of anthropology and sociology. The faculty   also believes that basic ethnography remains the cornerstone on which   all cultural anthropology rests and are concerned with the   representation of anthropological knowledge in writing and film.

Doctoral Program in Linguistic Anthropology Working closely with cultural anthropologists in the   department, linguistic anthropologists examine how language use and   choice shape the cultural and social diversity of communities and   persons.
