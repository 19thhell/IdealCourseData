Located in the    heart of Manhattan , computer science research at the NYU Media  Research Lab is incredibly interdisciplinary: we are interested in computer  graphics, geometric modeling, simulation, visualization, scientific  computing, machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics, digital  libraries, human movement, motion capture, and human-computer interaction.  We are involved in numerous cross-disciplinary collaborations with  mathematicians, engineers and artists.   We are one of a number of labs  affiliated with the VLG group."}]}]
