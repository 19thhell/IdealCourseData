Fellows participate in supervised clinical experiences in four principal rotations, each lasting three months. These rotations include a court-based evaluation clinic, an acute psychiatric unit for pre-trial detainees, a forensic hospital and a mandated outpatient treatment program. Fellows also have part-time supervised clinical rotations in a general forensic psychiatry private practice, which includes exposure to child/adolescent cases. Evaluation, research and teaching skills are emphasized at all of our principal clinical sites. In addition to the didactics described below, fellows participate in a year-long seminar on ethics; a year-long seminar in the basics of law; an original scholarly project that is submitted for Grand Rounds, a Mental Health Disability law class at NYU School of Law, mock trial experiences, and a field trip to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear oral arguments about a mental health case.   Classes and administrative offices are centrally located in Manhattan at Bellevue Hospital Center. Fellows rotate at four primary sites for three months each; all sites are based in New York City and are easily accessible by public transportation. The forensic private practice elective takes place for one half-day for six months in a local private office. Trainees are expected to be at rotation sites from approximately 9am to 5pm daily. Moonlighting is permitted.   Daily Schedule   Fellowship Rotations   Bellevue Hospital Jail Forensic Psychiatry Inpatient Service   This rotation is designed to assist fellows in the development of the requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors necessary to competently treat and manage acutely ill psychiatric inpatients who are in the custody of either the New York City Police Department or the New York City Correction Department. The patient population consists of men ages 16 years and older with a wide range of psychiatric disorders including a large percentage of seriously mentally ill, all of whom are facing legal issues at any point from arrest to conviction and sentencing.   Bellevue Hospital Forensic Psychiatry Court Clinic   This rotation aims to teach fellows how to perform comprehensive criminal outpatient forensic examinations and to write concise forensic psychiatric reports for submission to the courts and probation department. The population being evaluated consists of a broad demographic spectrum and wide range of psychopathology; male and female offenders; ages 13 years and older; and a wide variety of often co-morbid psychiatric disorders.   Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center   Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center (KFPC) is a maximum-security hospital of the New York State Office of Mental Health that provides treatment for insanity acquittees, incompetent defendants, and civilly committed patients who cannot be managed in less secure settings. This rotation helps fellows develop the requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes, and techniques necessary to work with long-term patients in a forensic setting, to assess dangerousness and competency, and to prepare reports for the court.   Manhattan Assisted Outpatient Treatment Program (AOT)   At this rotation fellows are taught to perform comprehensive forensic examinations for individuals referred for court-mandated outpatient treatment pursuant to Kendra's Law in New York State. Testimony is prepared and presented before the Court on each eligible case. The population being evaluated consists of a broad demographic spectrum, a wide range of psychopathology, and male and female offenders.   The Private Practice of Forensic Psychiatry   Fellows spend a half-day a week for six months learning about the private practice of general and child and adolescent forensic psychiatry. Multiple cases are conducted under the supervision of expert faculty. A wide range of evaluations are offered, including: child custody, juvenile justice, criminal responsibility, personal injury, disability, immigration issues, fitness for duty, testamentary capacity, personal injury, guardianship, domestic violence and eyewitness cases.   Didactic Curriculum   The didactic core curriculum includes educational modules on forensic assessment, criminal law, civil law, mental health law, correctional psychiatry, law and the legal system, ethics, child and adolescent forensic psychiatry, special issues in forensic assessment, introduction to forensic research, and forensic practice; seminars on administrative psychiatry, ethical issues in forensic psychiatry, research methodology, and supervision; addiction medicine for forensic psychiatrists; and a journal club that reviews the latest literature on issues and research in forensic psychiatry. One and one-half days per week are dedicated to this robust curriculum; one day of didactics is shared with the other NYC-area forensic psychiatry fellowships and one half-day is reserved for NYU residents only.

We consider such factors as one\u2019s writing ability, research experience, leadership potential, flexible temperament, interest in public psychiatry and career goals. We strive for a well-rounded, diverse class with individual strengths in different areas.   The program begins reviewing applications in June and interviews are usually scheduled to take place in July, August and early September.
