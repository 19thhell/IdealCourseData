Minneapolis            CHAPTER     1 SCIENCE AND       TECHNOLOGY     AS HEGEMONY            When my daughter Nona was two     years old, she frequently exclaimed, after a fall, \"the chair did it,\" or,     as she bumped into the wall, \"the wall did it.\" On September 11, 1986, the     New York stock market plunged eighty-six points. The next day, after a     drop of thirty-four points, a New     York Times story read, \"wide use of computers contributed to slide.\"     According to the writer, trading on the stock market is often detonated by     signals supplied by a computer program. It's a \"split second\"     automatic process; in appearance, at least, large institutional     traders such as pension plans and major banks respond to the slightest     movement of interest rates without significant reflection. On this     particular day, when stock traders came to their offices, \"they were met     by a big jump in interest rates . . . (which) immediately dragged down the     price of futures contracts for stocks.\" 1 This triggered sales     of current stocks by the money managers and widespread purchases of     futures contracts. As the large investors unloaded stocks, others followed     suit and stock prices plummeted. The investors respond to the computer as     my daughter might explain bumping into the wall. Of course, the Times and the analysts they     consulted allowed that national and international economic troubles might     be an underlying influence on the serious fall of stock prices that week,     but from the point of view of investors, it was their computer that seemed     to make the decision to sell.     That we live in a computer age     no one seems to doubt. Yet, along with the paeans of praise heaped upon     this electronic device, there is   4         also a growing chorus of     criticism and a pervasive mood of doubt about its redemptive features.     Actually, the computer is now widely viewed as more than a tool, after     three decades during which many of its proponents attempted to assure us     that, despite its considerable power, it is really an extension of the     human head and hand and has no autonomy. However, in recent years, this     view has been sharply attacked by experimental computer research, on the     one side, and by the practice of those who interact with it, on the other.     There are those like Herbert Simon who impute to it almost mystical     powers, the pinnacle of which is the ability of computers to think     (of course, in order to prove this proposition, Simon was forced to define     humans as \"information processors\"-a more complex conception would     certainly defeat his theory). 2 Artificial intelligence     research seeks to find ways to solve the age-old dilemma of uncertainty in     human action which has plagued the labor process, politics, and vast areas     of social life. Machines that     think are more reliably subject to prediction and     control.     But the computer seems to have     a mind of its own, especially if the controllers are guided by its     information. Many, including some computer scientists, have already     begun to compare computers to the Golem of the medieval ghetto or the     monster created by Dr. Frankenstein. Far from remaining a stunning     but subordinate tool, the computer frequently jumps the track,     subverting human purposes that set it in motion. Like the machines that     characterized the Industrial Revolution, computers are just the     latest occasion for the displacement of fears that \"things\" are out of     control, that their human origin has been lost, and that it is too late     for salvation.     My stock market example is by     no means the heart of the matter. For those who would not speak of     Chernobyl or Three Mile Island should also keep silent about the wonders     of technology. Naturally, those who continue to defend the use of nuclear     technology for supplying power attribute the problems at these sites to     \"human error,\" just as Union Carbide company officials blamed workers and     inadequate supervision for the disaster at Bhopal, India, in December 1984     which killed several thousand people and injured another     200,000. 3 The phrase \"human error\" usually refers to those who     operate equipment; when an airplane crashes, the pilot or maintenance     mechanic is nearly always blamed. Almost never is \"human error\" blamed on     the design of the aircraft or the basic judgment that nuclear energy is a     safe bet. When technology is involved, managers and the media rarely ask     whether the premises of the machine in question are valid. For example,     government officials are prepared to ask whether an adequate     evacuation   5     plan has been devised by a company operating a nuclear reactor;     the technique of generating nuclear energy or producing nuclear weapons is     beyond the competence of regulatory agencies because promoting nuclear     energy is national policy.          There are many reasons why nuclear     power and air travel became privileged technologies in fuel production     and transportation. I do not wish to dispute the economic and political     arguments employed by corporations to persuade the many governments, including     that of the United States, that these technologies were more efficient     than existing means of energy production. For our purposes, the criterion     of efficiency is closely linked to concepts such as cost savings, whose     major component is saving time-time in the extraction of raw materials     from the earth, a labor-intensive activity, or, concomitantly, the time     saved by traveling 650 miles per hour rather than 100 or 200 miles per     hour, the current maximum of rail transportation. Yet, rails have suffered     at the hands of trucks which are, by any conventional standard, more energy-wasteful     than trains. The contradictory arguments made on behalf of various methods     of transport belie pure efficiency criteria: it may be that choices of     technology are made entirely independent of \"rational\" production decisions     but obey a different rationality, the power imperative.     Some students of the     introduction of nuclear energy technology in advanced industrial societies     have raised an entirely different set of arguments why this dangerous,     even disastrous, way of obtaining energy has received such powerful     support. The argument is that the decisions to \"go nuclear\" transcend any     possible rational criteria, measured by economic or technical     considerations. Instead, these critics claim that the basic impetus for     the introduction of nuclear-powered energy is rooted in the hierarchical     structure of society. Those at the pinnacle are able to impose a logic of domination on the rest of     us by simply repeating their falsehoods through every avenue of public     debate and discourse. This explanation removes the discussion of     causality from the domain of instrumental reason. It is not this or     that interest that has triumphed, tragically, in the corridors of power.     Power itself carries its own demand, which exceeds, with impunity, the     boundaries of reason. In effect, power sets new rational codes without     reference to ideology.          If this is true, none of the     by now conventional rational criticisms are adequate to the situation.     One convention is to show that some interests can expect to reap huge     profits from the introduction of certain technologies. Another appeals     to the cult of efficiency as the supreme instrumental arbiter of social     choice. Each of these positions generates          6          a concomitant ideology or justification of action. The notion of power     as the arbiter requires no independent ideology to accompany it. By virtue     of its command over knowledge, it can manufacture justification to the     extent that the need for justification remains necessary in mass democracies.     For example, human survival is threatened by another major scientific/technological     development: genetic engineering, the technological concomitant of discoveries     generated by molecular biology. Gene splicing is a eugenic technoscience;     its justification is almost invariably built on the proposal to improve     the survival traits of the species by designing the gene rather than passively     accepting genetically related traits as unavoidable. Genetic engineering     is an intervention into evolution, an attempt to gain control over life     processes.          These examples are not, strictly     speaking, commensurable but are invoked to illustrate the range of issues     that are emerging to question technology and its twin, modern science.     Now the statement that science and technology have become inseparable     is certainly controversial, especially among those who would insist that     science is autonomous from the concerns of power and ideology. The division     between science and technology is meant to protect science from its implication     in the matrix of economic and political considerations, which are generally     recognized to influence - if not determine - the course of technological     development and its dispersion. It is still true, however, that most students     of science, while acknowledging the influence of what is often labeled     \"cultural factors\" on the process of knowledge acquisition, insist that     economic, political, and ideological questions must be strictly demarcated     from considerations bearing on the content of scientific knowledge. Instead,     the term \"scientific community\" has become identical with \"social context.\"     Indeed, recent developments in the social study of science have narrowed     this context to the laboratory, leaving other \"external\" influences aside.     Despite developments over the past thirty years which try to establish     a relation between scientific discourses and the historical and other     social conditions within which they function, support for the proposition     that science and the scientific milieu is relatively autonomous is still     powerful. In Part III, I shall explore developments in the philosophy,     history, and social study of science that have challenged the idea that     what counts as knowledge of the external world is attained by means of     scientific procedures alone. As we shall see, most investigators of science     remain tied to the concept of science as a distinct knowledge sphere and     have barely touched its relation to technology. The great exception, of     course, is Critical Theory, the foundation of which is to establish this          7          link and to assert the dominance of technology over science as well as     its domination over contemporary social relations.          The assertion that Western culture     is thoroughly technological derives from the German \"romantic\" critique     of the Enlightenment, a critique which members of the Frankfurt School     share with strains of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century neo-Kantian     thought, especially Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. After arguing     that the \"rationalism of the Age of Enlightenment is now out of the question,\"     Husserl nevertheless is quick to add, \"but their [the Enlightenment philosophies]     intention, in its most general sense, must never die out in us\"; the intention     is a \"humanity based on pure reason.\" 4 Max Horkheimer and Theodor     Adorno follow a similar line of argument. They lament the Enlightenment,     which created a new science and technology that could dominate nature     in order to promote the flowering of reason, but that led instead to its     eclipse. The end of reason was rooted in the belief, current even today,     that nature could be reduced to pure object, possessing mere quantitative     extension. The mathematicization and mechanization of the world picture     was undertaken by seventeenth-century science in the service of prediction     and control. In the process, according to Husserl, we lost contact with     the \"life world\" in a series of dualisms: mind and body, quantity and     quality, mathematic relations and human relations. For the Frankfurt School,     the logical result was positivism - the alienation of human reason from     itself.          Whereas Husserl's critique remains     at the level of philosophic discourse, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Herbert     Marcuse ascribed these dichotomies to the rending of society by social     domination. The domination of nature fulfills a human project, the domination     of people by people. Science and technology are practices that mirror     the social world.          Still, the Frankfurt School     was criticizing the enlightenment from within. Although Marcuse was     ambiguous concerning science, claiming at one point that a new science     free of technological domination needed to be created, he proclaims in     the final chapter of his One Dimensional Man that science     and technology \"are great vehicles of liberation\" if only they can be     subordinated to new ends to replace those of domination. These ends \"would     operate in the project and construction of machinery and not only in its     utilization.\" Technology can be instrumental \"in the reduction of toil     - it remains the very base of all forms of human freedom.\" 6 Thus,     the sharpest critics of science and technology hesitate at the door of     irrationalism and will not cross the threshhold, however harsh their evaluation     of the gloomy record          8          of domination that lies in the wake of modern science and technology.     On the other side, of course, lies reason's nemesis: religion, mysticism,     myth.          The warfare between what has     been called \"science\" and other discourses that purport to explain the     natural and social worlds is a story many times told. As Gaston Bachelard     has argued, science is constituted by its break from competing discourses     that claim to explain the same objects. 7 Physics, for example,     breaks with forms of \"irrationalism\" but also with metaphysics. As Bachelard's     contemporary, Karl Popper, has commented, \"metaphysics offers meanings     that may be helpful to other aspects of human affairs, but not science. 8     Science, for Popper and Bachelard, is established by statements that can     be subjected to refutation (in Bachelard's terms, \"empirical validation\").     It is the spirit and practice of relentless self-criticism that marks     science off from other discourses, including traditional philosophy. For     recent philosophers of science, even these procedures do not guarantee     that the results are identical with \"truth,\" only that they are demarcated     thereby from other discourses. Within true science, there may be serious     and often profound disputes of interpretation. But what all scientists     share is a community rooted     in method. The primacy of shared methods guarantees the reliability of     what counts as science. In Parts II and III we shall explore these assertions     in more detail. For now, it is enough to suggest that what those dedicated     to Western scientific ideology mean by the term \"science\" reduces to two     procedures: mathematical calculation and experimental validation/falsification     of results. Mathematics ensures the rigor of investigation, establishing     measurable relations and, in Bachelard's words, \"gives body to pure thought.\"     Mathematics is \"the realization of the rational.\" However, lest science     fall victim to Descartes's unwarranted \"refusal to base thought on experience,\"     experimentalism restores to observation its role as final arbiter of knowledge. 9           Presumably, neither philosophy     nor religion fulfills either of these criteria. Modern science demarcates     itself, not by reconstituting the object, but by defining rationality     in a specific way. At the same time, given the power of all metaphysical     discourses in everyday life, it is obliged to make room for the extrascientific     so long as these spheres are clearly subordinated to scientific rationality.     In the knowledge hierarchies of postfeudal societies, modern scientific     rationality is the privileged discourse, and. all others are relegated     to the margins. As a result, institutions of the state as well as the     economy -- education systems, government bureaus, the law and criminal     justice systems -- emulate scientific procedures within the constraints     imposed by their          9          own traditions and exigencies. Art and religion hold their places at the     margins of human endeavor and become extracurricular, or, to use Freud's     term, \"deflections,\" for the frustrations produced by the inhibition of     desire by the reality principle. 10           The rise of Protestantism in     leading industrializing countries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries     seemed to provide moral sanction for the preeminent position of modern     science as knowledge. Religious institutions now viewed themselves as     supplicants in an increasingly secular age and understood their role not     so much as deflectors but as moral guardians for individuals damaged by     the blandishments of money and power. The type of knowledge offered by     religion was confined to the ethical sphere; it concerned itself with     matters of family life, personal grief, and, when it felt obliged to take     social action, it was remedial rather than transformative. The great denominations     of Protestantism relinquished that which Catholicism had struggled to     retain: a claim on epistemological as well as ontological truth. However,     in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the triumph of world capitalism     over the remnants of the old feudal aristocracy in eastern and southern     Europe forced even the recalcitrant Catholic and other orthodox churches     to accommodate to the new order.          By the late nineteenth century,     industrial production depended on scientifically based technologies; the     craft traditions, of which early manufacturing was merely a form of rationalization,     were themselves subordinated to the new technology; the motive force of     production, energy, was no longer mechanical -- really an extension of     hand or water power -- but became electrical, the principles of which     derived from \"pure research\"; engineering replaced artisanal knowledge     in designing the mode of transformation of raw materials into end products;     in turn, the intellectual foundation of engineering became physics and     chemistry, which themselves were institutionalized into large laboratories     sponsored by and controlled by the state and large corporations. Thus,     science itself no longer is only a hegemonic ideology of the new social     order of capitalism and its industrial stage, but becomes integrated into     the practices and discourses of production. The inter-changeability of     science and technology is, of course, either denied or ignored by most     philosophers and scientists, but their growing convergence extends beyond     the workplace. 11 As scientific discourse permeates state and     civil society, scientific culture spills over beyond the laboratory. Business     dares make no decisions that are not grounded on mathematical calculation     that provides projections; legislators enact laws based on \"data\" generated     by scientifically trained experts Raymond Callahan has noted, referring     to education, that technological          10          criterion of efficiency becomes the new cult of public and private schools. 12      In schools, the idea of the liberal arts slowly gives way to occupational     education. \"Functional\" literacy becomes the criterion of success for     no-frills state school systems that are stripped of their music and drawing     curricula and which reduce English and history to service departments     for the technical-oriented programs. Therefore, in several dramatic moments     since World War II, beefing up science and math in schools has become     a matter of high government priority since these disciplines are understood     to be vital for a country's economic and military position in an increasingly     competitive and dangerous world.          Science education is accorded,     in the current anxiety over the loss of America's erstwhile preeminence     in industrial production, a primary role in the long road to restoration.     In the 1980s, as the defense budget of the United States has increased     dramatically, engineers and scientists are in demand in military-related     industries. Consequently, despite enormous pressure from government and     industry on schools, teacher recruitment in science and math has lagged,     primarily because salaries are far below those offered by private industry     and research institutions. Reversing its steadfast policy of reducing     federal expenditures and advocacy of scaled-down public services at all     levels, the Reagan administration saw the virtue of making an exception     for the teaching of science and math.          These illustrations do not exhaust     the extent to which technological culture penetrates the social world.     Right after World War II, as America assumed a position of economic, political,     and military dominance in the world, secularism -- always closely related     to the growth of modern science and technology -- seemed to have triumphed,     irrevocably, in the cultural sphere as well. Church attendance dropped     sharply, and religion in this most religious of modernized societies seemed     finally on the wane, a century after its final marginalization in most     industrialized European countries. 13           Technological culture may not     provide salve for the spirit, and it may do nothing to fill the void left     by the marginalization of religious morality, but, as even its most severe     critics are forced to admit, it gives rein to the pleasure principle.     As Marcuse observed, in advanced capitalist societies, especially the     United States, \"the defense structure makes life easier for a greater     number of people and extends man's mastery over nature.\" 14 Although     his description of technological society as a \"comfortable, smooth, democratic     unfreedom\" was adopted by some as a reason for opposing the prevailing     setup, millions who had been condemned to deprivation during the decades     of industrialization wel comed technology as a savior.          11           Culture was massified, overtaking high art     and marginalizing the intellectuals for whom it was sustenance, but providing     a respite from the drudgery of even the most automated labor. Marcuse     may have spoken for more than the intellectuals. His remorse for the contradictions     of the Enlightenment finally paled against the achievements of science     and technology. As a child of reason, he was unable to draw the logical     conclusion from his critique that science and technology had become obstacles     to freedom. Writing in the early 1960s, he could only allow that a transformed     science and technology might serve the emancipatory interest better than     the version that had emerged from the Dark Ages.          Goethe once quipped, \"He who     possesses science and art also has religion; but he who possesses neither     of these two, let him have religion.\" 15 The vision is a thoroughly     pluralist one. Science and art are to exist alongside religion, which     as Freud noted, echoing Goethe, was the possession of everyman, defined     as someone lacking the means to sublimate the irrepressible pleasure principle.     For the nineteenth-century poet or scientist, the idea that religion would     one more time raise its claim to yield reliable knowledge of the external     natural world was unthinkable. Freud is quite clear: the belief in the     supernatural is an \"untenable\" doctrine but better for the common folk     than alcohol or drugs. Just as long as it is not taken seriously as more     than an opiate. 16           But this is precisely what has     transpired in the past decade. Despite the unambiguous triumph of the     scientific worldview and the totalizing effects of technology, science     and technology are experiencing unprecedented attack. For the past fifteen     years, counterenlightenment religious movements have taken on worldwide     and revolutionary proportions. Far from disdaining politics as beneath     their ethical missions, some Jews, Moslems, and Christians alike have     laid siege to the state, demanding that public life conform to religious     precepts and that the separation of church and state be ended. The theocratic     state, once consigned by scholars, politicians, and jurists to the past,     is loudly proclaimed as the present and future by the new movements, and     has already captured important outposts in the Middle East -- within the     Moslem, Christian and Jewish worlds -- and is rapidly becoming the sine     qua non of political victory for parties in the United States. 17      Here, it is not only that lawmakers adopt biblical criteria for     establishing the rules of punishment; this is an old story in America.     The doctrine of retribution opposes itself to the idea that the criminal     may be subject to rehabilitation. In retrospect, liberal assumptions about     crime seem a brief interlude in an unbroken history of deep-seated, religiously     based conservatism in American law and political          12          life. Fundamentalist theology is reentering the public schools as well.     And among its adversaries, none is more significant than modern science.     As biologist Douglas Futuyama has warned, science is \"on trial\" and reason     is \"under fire.\" 18 A new science of creationism has challenged     the exclusive teaching of evolution in public schools and demanded that     its \"science\" be given equal treatment. This is no longer merely a case     of the ministry getting involved in politics, supporting candidates who     favor state aid to parochial schools. Such requests, made by the Catholic     Church for decades, challenge the separation of church and state but do     not confront the ideological hegemony of modern scientific doctrine. Indeed,     many parochial schools of Catholic and Protestant origins teach modern     science and mathematics as necessary elements of a relevant curriculum,     relevant, that is, to the job and career aspirations of their own constituencies.     The fundamental distinction between the old political intervention of     religious institutions, either on behalf of social justice or their own     parochial interests, and the new fundamentalism is that the latter condemns     enlightenment science as ideology, as one viewpoint in a plurality of     discourses possessing no privileged knowledge of the external world. Thus,     its demand for an equal place in the curriculum. In essence, fundamentalism     has stepped forward where enlightenment critics of science have stepped     back. For the purposes of this discussion, it is not relevant to point     out the absurdities of the creationist account of the origins of the universe,     life, and the evolution of species. At issue is the claim of enlightenment     science to certainty and its refusal to acknowledge its own discourse     as a form of ideology.          Take a case in point. In the     course of his attack against creationist accounts of development, Futuyama     makes two arguments: \"anyone who believes in Genesis as a literal description     of history must hold a world view that is entirely incompatible with the     idea of evolution, not to speak of science itself. . . where science insists     on material, mechanistic causes that can be understood by physics and     chemistry, the literal believer in Genesis invokes unknowable supernatural     forces.\" 19           The second argument is, for     Futuyama, more important: \"if the world and its creatures developed purely     by material, physical forces, it could not have been designed and has     no purpose or goal. The fundamentalist, in contrast, believes that everything     in the world, every species and every characteristic of every species,     was designed by an intelligent, purposeful artificer, and that it was     made for a purpose.\" 20 Futuyama defends evolution and the whole     of science as holding that \"mechanisms,\" not teleology, govern events     in nature. These mechanisms free science from reliance on Aristotelian     final causes and rely          13          instead on the sufficiency of efficient causes. Changes within and among     species can be ascribed not to ultimate purposes of God, but to the struggle     for existence, to adaptation by organisms to a changing environment. Futuyama's     underlying view is that of \"material, mechanistic\" explanations for natural     events: he identifies this view as identical with that of \"science.\"          Surely, the propositions of     evolutionary theory are incompatible with creationism. For modern biological     science, there is no question of plan or purpose in nature (although as     Alexandre Koyre shows, Newton was convinced that physical laws corresponded     to God's plan even if teleological explanation had no place in physics). 21      However, many evolutionists and philosophers of biology have come     to insist that Aristotle's idea of final cause, so vehemently rejected     by the early evolutionists, had a place in modern scientific theory. Stephen     J. Gould remarks:           It is still unfashionable in     biological circles to use such words as 'design,' 'purpose,' or     'teleology.' Since final cause is so indispensable a concept in the     elucidation of adaptation, and since natural selection can produce a     well-designed structure without any conscious intervention of God's     superhuman wisdom or the sub-human intelligence of the animal in question,     one would think that these terms would again be admitted into orthodoxy.     Evidently, however, we are still fighting the battle with theologians that     we won in deeds almost a century ago. 22            Futuyama may be one of those     still fighting the battle, but in his zeal to distance evolution from     theology, he succeeds only in making his ideas into the mirror image of     his opponent's. Francois Jacob puts the issue colorfully. Commenting on     the role of sexual reproduction as the \"aim\" for each organism and for the     history of organisms, he concludes, \"For a long time, the biologist     treated teleology as he would a woman he could not do without, but did not     care to be seen with in public. The concept of the programme has made an     honest woman out of teleology.\" 23           Today, the metaphors of program     and system to describe the processes of heredity and organic evolution     have opened a new debate concerning the question of causality in biological     science. The earlier belief that science could dispense with causal explanation     in favor of description was intended to remove from natural science what     Laplace termed the \"hypothesis\" of God's design. What has been termed     \"essentialism\" is not so easily removed. The religious counterattack against modern science may be misplaced, but it resonates          14           with a widespread     feeling among ordinary people that science has become a kind of priesthood     and that scientists, like the old priests, are not always forthcoming     about their own doubts, at least in public. The new attack on modern science,     however, is not mounted simply on the authority of the Bible is the true     word of God: it claims the mantle of science. Controversies within science     that reveal deep fissures within that community on questions such as causality     and truth have, until recently, been conducted behind closed doors. in     biology, the mechanical world picture is challenged; in physics, the image     of nature as pure objective extension, subject to prediction and control,     is questioned by those whose work functions at the level of theory, at     the same time practitioners insist that the old news is still best.          Perhaps the most broad-based     skepticism has arisen in the field of medicine. There are several issues     here: at the most fundamental level is the question of the traditional     medical model of diagnosis and treatment. According to this way of seeing,     the human body is a machine (in the older version) or a computer program     (in the up-to-date model). The parts are relatively autonomous, making     possible a treatment regimen that ignores the relations of the parts to     the whole, except in cases of side effects which can be counteracted.     In the old mold of medical practice, the relation of the person to the     environment and the emotional state to the physical state are irrelevant.     In the first instance, unless severe hunger is observed, nutritional issues     are not factored into diagnostic practice. The context of medical practice     itself -- treating individuals -- does not permit the effects of such     \"external\" phenomena as pollution, work environments, quality of life     based on economic circumstances, end stress related to working or family     life, to become objects of treatment.          Medicine, based on the findings     of molecular biology, adopts a systems approach to both diagnosis and     treatment. In the more ecological mode, the human body is an open-ended     system that is determined by its genetic code,     but may be influenced by the     environment with which it has homeostatic relations. In the less interesting     version, the body is a dosed system consisting of information networks     that are only peripherally subject to external influences. Francis Crick's     version of the basic requirements for life includes the Darwinian idea,     adapted from Thomas Malthus, that the organism must compete for water,     food, and other life-sustaining resources. But, In the final accounting,     its capacity for survival, he argues, is its internally generated information     system which is built up from its molecular structures. 24 Second     is its capacity to mutate In the wake of changing conditions, a capacity               15          that is given internally. Recent medical science has taken its picture     from Crick and his associate James Watson, who together played key roles     in developing molecular biology. The organism itself remains the object     of study, pristine in Its singularity but seen not so much as a series     of parts but as a system of \"organized complexity\" whose driving force     is the molecular structure of the gene. 25 We treat individuals     differently than before. Since \"the problem of life is a problem of organic     chemistry,\" 26 measures taken to repair damaged organs should     seek both diagnosis and treatment in dysfunctions in chemical combinations     that affect the organ's information program. Thus, such diverse pathologies     as psychosis and cancer become subject to chemical treatment. One seeks     the reasons for various emotional illnesses not in the stresses produced     by the life situation but in chemical malfunctions. Similarly, the most     widely used treatment for some cancers is chemotherapy.          Of course, medical applications     of molecular biology are only one of the major changes initiated by this     new discipline. More controversial, and surely more problematic, have     been the new technologies of genetic engineering which present themselves,     in their visionary manifestations, as fulfilling the dream of both nineteenth-century     eugenics and modern medicine to eliminate disuse by altering those traits     that make humans less competitive in a changing physical environment.     According to Jeremy Rifkin, \"we are virtually hurling ourselves into the     age of biotechnology.\" Molecular biology has succeeded in changing the     heredity of the gene, transferring genes from one organism to another     and, perhaps, more powerfully, has synthesized cells through engineering.     Its most recent applications in food technology promise to eliminate the     need for chemical preservatives.     Molecular biology is a science     with a purpose and design: it seeks to transform life by recombining DNA     which it has postulated as the core of life. This aim surely violates a     wide spectrum of religious principles but also raises profound ethical     issues. For, even if altering or remaking life were to be judged a worthy     social purpose, the question is to whom are scientists performing these     tasks to be accountable? This issue is in the process of adjudication by law and the courts in the     United States, and the results are, to some, horrifying. The industrial     state Of mind has dominated these discoveries and in the United States,     this means private ownership and control of the means of production     (splicing) and of the product (altered organisms). Indeed MIT has recently     forged an extensive series of arrangements with some major biotechnology     firms. In return for huge grants for research the university has agreed     that the patents for discoveries will belong to the   16 corporations. Courts have     decided that these arrangements are legal because they have viewed     bioengineering as simply one more industry. In a free society, so the     argument goes, we may sanction a free market in gene splicing just as we     recognize the free market in the production of steel or cars.     Measures to prevent corporations from engaging in commerce violate     their rights under law.          Two major issues are raised     by these developments. The first is whether we can afford to free the     new discoveries associated with bio-technologies from rigorous public     control, assuming we could identify an appropriate regulatory agency.     The second strikes to the heart of the conflict between modern science     and religion, but has also been framed by nonfundamentalists who, nevertheless,     hold to ethical beliefs that are counter to some types of scientific investigation.     Simply stated, the issue is whether modern science has a right to alter     our relationship with nature, sui generis. On the one side, the     fundamentalists argue against any scientific discoveries that may violate     the word of God as they have interpreted it. For those who would reject     such objections on the grounds that they are \"irrational,\" the alternative     does not imply accepting the new biotechnologies. For if the aim of bioengineering     is to transform our relation to nature, especially our own \"nature,\" then     the claim of science to be free of purpose, to be engaged in some anterior     conception of \"pure\" science is most suspect. If modern science does not     imply the intervention of supernatural powers, it nonetheless cannot escape     interrogation of its underlying ethical assumptions, neither with respect     to the content of its propositions, which it calls \"laws\" of nature, nor     with respect to its responsibility for the results of its investigations.          What is at stake here is the     question of entailment. If     molecular biology chooses to link its discoveries in DNA and RNA research     to industrial tasks, are we not justified to ask whether such discoveries     do themselves entail ethically problematic purposes? This becomes especially     relevant at a time when universities, the traditional seats of scientific     research, are making agreements with large corporations and the government,     which provide the bulk of the funds for their work. Under these circumstances,     the claim of free inquiry becomes difficult to sustain.     Yet, it would be a mistake to     declare that science and technology are entirely determined, in their     content as well as their uses, by the hands that feed them. Science is a     complex, multivaried activity. Its relation to what it \"observes\" is never     unmediated: that is, the economic, political, and social environment     in which people \"do\" science and technology intervenes between     cognition and its object. Alexandre Koyre, 17   who vehemently rejects     explanations for scientific discovery that depend on the practical     conditions that may spur it on, substitutes metaphysics and philosophy as     mediations between theory, experiment, and nature. Similarly, Paul     Davies ascribes the continuing popularity of astronomy to the fact     that the study of the heavens is not far from our common and still     passionate desire for transcendence, for the supernatural. At the same     time, he emphasizes the rebelliousness of nature, its \"inherent     uncertainty,\" its \"randomness,\" and the significance of     \"subjectivity\" in the new physics. According to Davies, the \"observer is     beginning to play a rather essential role in the nature of the world,\"     making absurd objectivist concepts of time and space, including those that     impute to nature an inherent order. 27           Indeed, difficulties experienced     by partisans of a picture of nature as a unified field have generated     major debates within physics. It is generally recognized by physicists     themselves that few of its discoveries are exempt from the variability     brought to them by interpretation. The facts do not speak for themselves     and, through this door, marches religion and other metaphysical doctrines     as well as philosophy. In Part Ill, I shall discuss the relation between     philosophies and the social conditions that may give rise to them, challenging     Koyre and others who wish to preserve the internalist account of science     by limiting the context of discovery to purely intellectual influences.     Suffice it to mention here that many who speak of nature as a unified     field tread dangerously close to teleology, and even God, as the ultimate     purpose. David Bohm, a theoretical physicist, asserts the formal unity     of all natural phenomena, defining physical laws as tending toward the     absolute through the study of partial, relative phenomena; most important,     he defends causality in nature as an unlimited principle. That is, for     Bohm, order, not randomness, is inherent in nature, the truth of which     can be grasped by science. Although he has no recourse to the supernatural,     Bohm insists that there are \"hidden variables\" in quantum mechanics that     belie the picture of randomness and indeterminacy put forward by such     thinkers as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. 28      In short, the struggle between     mechanistic science and religion reappears in different form within     science itself. As I have shown, teleology is almost respectable in     biology, and one of the great debates initiated by Einstein     (unwittingly) and Heisenberg (with some hesitation) is whether God plays     dice with the universe. Some of the key interpretative struggles     within physics are whether we may posit real time and space, and whether     the intervention of \"subjectivity\" removes these categories from the realm     of objectivity. More broadly, the question remains: what do we know when     we know something? If our knowl- 18   edge is ineluctably bound up     with the processes of observation and experiment, and if these are     permeated with a priori assumptions about the character of the observed or     the uses to which knowledge is destined to be put, in what sense can we     say that science as a type of knowledge is superior to metaphysics,     including religion?     Social ecology and radical     feminism, two social movements of considerable political and     ideological weight in many advanced industrial societies have, from an     ethical standpoint, challenged the content and results of contemporary     science and technology. Both have their roots in the 1960s and early 1970s     when a general skepticism about the autonomy of science was invoked     because of the subordination of much of the scientific community to     military requirements, and the propping of scientific research and     technological innovation by industry. Yet, the content of their critique     differs from the assertion that the problem of science and technology     consists essentially in the uses to which discovery and innovation     are put. Instead, social ecology and radical feminism have mounted a     fundamental critique of the scientific worldview, especially the     contention that science and technology are neutral instruments that can be     separated from the context in which they are developed. Social ecology     argues that science and technology, by virtue of their subordination to     the interest of the domination of nature, share responsibility with the     state and capitalist corporations for the \"death of nature,\" a metaphor     that describes the increasing danger to life wrought by scientifically     based technology. Rather than blame the growing problem of environmental     pollution merely on the lack of state regulation, ecologists argue that     technologies of boundless domination are leading to ecological     disaster. On the one hand, the idea of nature as pure \"object\" has been a     normal presupposition of practical physics insofar as it has enabled     nature to be defined by categories of pure extension in the service of     prediction and control. On the other hand, the imperiousness of molecular     biology consists in its eugenic ideology, its eagerness to play God by     altering the distinctive characteristics of our species. Ecologists     explain the rebelliousness of nature as a reaction to human interventions     that disturb its internal relations and its homeostatic relations with     various species of life. The consequences of the industrial logic that     marks contemporary biology can be dangerous to life. But the explanation     given by social ecology for this state of affairs transcends the purview     of social policy. What enables science to engage in life endangering     activities is a belief that humans may insure their future by subjecting     the gene to engineering, just as earlier industrialists exploited     nonrenewable raw materials to advance various ends, including profits and     the promise of liberation   19 from material hardship and other socially     approved values. Here we are engaged in a drama of both intention and     unintentional consequences. The ideology of nature as \"other\" or     \"matter\" undifferentiated by quality and infinitely fungible is a     necessary condition for a science that has integrated itself into     technology, in which the difference between them becomes analytic rather     than ontological. Theoretical physics and biology may try to hold     themselves aloof from the uses to which their discoveries may be put;     Einstein certainly did not mean to lend his discoveries to the invention     of weapons of nuclear destruction, and seventeenth-century     astronomers may not have performed their work exclusively for the sake of     improving instruments of navigation. Nor is it necessary to make     direct connections between developments in wave mechanics and the     rise of communications technology. The arguments made by those who try to     discover, both by empirical research and by inference, a commercial or     industrial telos in processes of discovery are certainly misdirected.     The point is, rather, to examine the tendency of scientific ideology, the     stuff of which discovery is made, that is, to situate science as a     discourse within a larger system of social relations in which economic and     political influences do not necessarily appear directly in the     laboratory.          Ecology takes two directions     on this issue. One is to argue from what might be called a historical     standpoint: this is no longer the age of the individual thinker puttering     in the laboratory under conditions similar to those of the artist. While     scientific procedures may be considered quite distinct from those of the     artist (except perhaps the composer of music), the creative side of science     was, at the time of Galileo and even Lavoisier, commensurable with that     of art. Scientific and artistic work requires months, perhaps years, of     drudgery. But the process of scientific discovery in the seventeenth and     eighteenth centuries, and even well into the nineteenth, was marked by     individual effort. The scientist, like the artist, worked alone or with     very small groups. Then comes Pasteur, in the later years of the century,     a professor who, as Bruno Latour reports, attaches himself to forces of     industry and the state and makes science a social force. 29 Latour's     narrative of Pasteur's claim that he had made a serum that cured an anthrax     epidemic in France was not validated through reproducible experiments     made by scientists but by three institutions possessing the power to certify     such a claim: the scientific community, of course; milk processors and     producers requiring some relief from a costly and nearly devastating outbreak     of the disease among cattle; and the state. Latour's conclusion is not     that \"society\" influences the course of science, but that the laboratory     becomes a model for social power. Drawing on FoucauIt's thesis          20          that the knowledge/power relation becomes characteristic of modern society,     not only does Latour posit this conjuncture as the condition of scientific     truth, but he conversely argues that traditional institutional power draws     its strength from the laboratory which in the twentieth century becomes     a producer of commodities and of social power. Latour wishes to demonstrate     that science is not subordinate to capital, as Marx and Marxists argue,     but has become a crucial form of capital, with the laboratory a site of     its production. Science retains some of the features of art, but the process     of scientific discovery has been permanently removed from anything resembling     an autonomous sphere.          Science lends itself to integration     because it shares, with the rest of society, the teleology of domination     over nature. Its incorporation into industry and the state may be necessary     for the survival of nations, considering the world economic and political     order. But, as these ecologists contend, such a close relationship between     science and the forces of order means that industry has been able to multiply     its productive powers by geometric proportions over industrial production     in the (relatively) prescientific age. Specifically, the transformation     of physical, chemical, and biological knowledge into instruments of economic,     political, and military power is the foundation of our ecological crisis.          It does not matter that the     scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic/industrial     and military power. The evidence is overwhelming that such is the case.     Thus, every major industrial power has a national science policy; the     United States military appropriates billions each year for \"basic\" as     well as \"applied\" research. The National lnstitutes of Health provide     vast sums for research that will be transformed into industrial technologies     by private corporations which, in turn, make products for industry and     for mass consumption that often spell disaster for the environment. What     distinguishes this indictment from the criticisms of environmentalists     is the demand by ecologists for new social arrangements that embody a     radically new principle in our collective relationship to nature. Their     demand for an ecologically pacific natural environment threatens the organized     complexity of the marriage of science and industry in every country. The     collective nature of scientific research is made possible only by the     investments of the state and large corporations. Better to halt this form     of science and return to science as art. Under such circumstances, a way     of life would come to an end, for scientific and technological development     underlies rising standards of living in the most industrially developed     countries. Beyond the standard of living is a whole concept of culture     based upon consumption, our notions of the relation-          21          ship between work and what we call \"leisure,\" in short, our relationship     to experience. That the \"technological sensorium\" dominates everyday life     seems hardly disputable. 30 The question is whether this is     what we want. Ecology normatively challenges this sensorium rather than     focusing only on its effects. It has formed and inspired movements, political     parties, and massive protests against those who employ scientifically     produced technologies that, in its view, inhibit freedom. What is at stake     in its alternative is the possibility of constructing a social ethic that     proposes different assumptions about what constitutes the good life. For     the philosophy of ecology, a world without domination, domination of nations,     of women, of nature, of cultures, requires a radically different conception     of science and technology since what it entails is a radically new idea     of the everyday.     Ecology's critique of science     and technology, while not ostensibly religious, suggests that ethical     neutrality with respect to the results of scientific enterprise is not     justified. The ecological position, in its most sophisticated formulation,     challenges the idea that any form of human knowledge can be separated from     its consequences. If one finds that science has made an alliance with     prevailing forces of destruction to further the interest of domination of     humans, its position as an unassailable, almost sacrosanct discourse     must be overturned. Murray Bookchin, perhaps America's most trenchant and     global ecological theorist, puts the case:           In our discussions of modern     ecological and social crises, we tend to ignore the more underlying     mentality of domination of each other and by extension of nature. I refer     to an image of the natural world that sees nature as \"blind,\" \"mute,\"     \"cruel,\" \"competitive,\" and \"stingy,\" a seemingly demonic \"realm of     necessity\" that opposes \"man's\" striving for freedom and self-realization.     . . . This all-encompassing image of an intractable nature that must be     tamed by a rational humanity has given us a domineering form of reason,     science and technology. 31            To this image, Bookchin     opposes \"an ecological standpoint: nature as a constellation of     communities . . . freed of all anthropocentric moral trappings, a     participatory realm of interacting life forms whose most outstanding     attributes are fecundity, creativity and directedness marked by     complementarity.\" 32  Bookchin     clearly identifies traditional notions of reason, science, and technology     with the identification of nature with the capitalist marketplace (itself     linked to conventional evolution theory, which, as I have noted, is     adapted by Darwin from 22   Malthusian conceptions of     natural history). In effect, Bookchin counterposes nature in     metaphors derived from art to those of enlightenment science, which     has employed the metaphors of commodity relations. In both cases, we     have recourse to ethical discourses in which telos is present as a     regulative principle. Enlightenment science, which believes itself free of     references to purpose, and aim in its conception of nature, has, as     Bookchin shows, simply portrayed nature in the image of capitalist social     relations. In contrast, reflecting the views of a wide spectrum of     ecological thought, Bookchin frankly admits that ecology pictures nature     as an active, purposive agency, clinging to standard notions of     objectivity when he tries to distance ecological thought from     \"anthropocentric moral trappings.\" This anachronism in Bookchin's     discourse reveals not so much the weakness of ecological ideas as the     strength of science as a hegemonic ideology. For the meaning of \"hegemony\"     consists precisely in its presence within the discourse of opponents     of the dominant ideology. At the same time, it can be argued that the     ecological and feminist critiques of modern science are based on exposing     science as ideology by means of showing its subjectivity, its character as     ambiguous moral agent.     The explosion of the modern     feminist movement since the late l960s has generated what is perhaps the     richest body of social theory in the last twenty years. This is not to     ignore the extraordinary work of Simon de Beauvoir or earlier theorists     of feminism such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 33 or the many feminist     novelists whose critiques of marriage and the family were framed within     conventional literary forms. Feminist theory has sought to explore the     position of women in the West as well as the Third World in a great number     of intellectual fields. Feminist historians have sought to debunk the myth     that there is no \"her\" story in economic, political, and cultural terms.     Since, as Walter Benjamin remarked, history is written by the victors, the     hidden story of women's struggles for equality and escape from the yoke of     male domination has to be told by other women who will explore the     underside of dominant narratives. This history joins the general movement     of social history that has succeeded in uncovering the lives of working     people, black slaves, and other \"invisible\" groups denied a public     identity by those who are the appointed guardians of official history.     Sociologists and anthropologists have explored the lives of women engaged     in homemaking, and have sought to restore to that activity the name     labor.\" 34 Others have theorized the equal social weight of the labor of     biological and social reproduction -- especially child rearing -- with that     of material production, arguing     that women participate as workers in both spheres but have been     systematically 23 expunged from considerations     of questions of social relations and power. In short, the lives of women,     their forms of self-production and self-organization, their successes and     failures, have been the loud silence in historical and social scientific     studies. A whole army of feminist scholars have made enormous efforts     to recover women's voices, to uncover the specificity of women's     discourse.          The attempt to find women's     voice in science, especially in scientific discovery, proceeds according     to at least two major roads of inquiry. First is to assert that women     have participated in science and technology, if not as equals, at least     in considerable depth. The figures of geneticist Barbara McClintock, organizational     and technological theorist Lillian Gilbreth, physical therapist Sister     Elizabeth Kenny, and physicist Marie Curie are invoked only to illustrate     the range of contributions that women have made to scientific and technological     discovery. Citing Erik Erickson's question, \"what will happen to science     if and when women are truly represented in it -- not by a few glorious     exceptions, but in the ranks of the scientific elite?\" Evelyn Fox Keller     is quick to remind us that despite McClintock's contribution to understanding     the mechanism of inheritance, she is still the exception, and that science     is dominated by men. 36 Extensive study of McClintock's difficult     travail as a genuine theorist rather than practitioner of normal science     was meant to illustrate that, as a visionary, she faced resistance from     a scientific elite ensconced in its own assumptions and prejudices against     women, and that the moral neutrality of scientists could not be assumed     despite the possibility that McClintock offered new knowledge. Keller's     interest is to show that sex and gender relations bear on the exclusion     of women from scientific communities and that these relations are deeply     rooted in the ideology of Western culture, inscribed in its most eminent     philosophical works -- that woman is other, is identified with nature,     and is an object of domination. Francis Bacon, one of the formative figures     in the development of modern scientific ideology, was also a key proponent     of the identity of science with male power. Nor was he exceptional. Keller's     reading of Plato's Symposium and     Phaedrus reveals the close relationship of male sexuality and the production     of knowledge. Knowledge for Plato is erotically based, but closed to female     participation 37           While affirming that gender     has become a crucial element in the exclusion of women from science, Keller     rejects the idea advanced by some feminist writers that Western science     is male science. In feminist theory, this concept seeks to remove from     Western science the mantle of objectivity by proving that its antiecological     practices -- and, even more significant, the mathematicization of nature     and the scientific          24          ethic of prediction and control -- are steps toward the exclusion of women     and undermine modern science's universalism claims. Whereas Keller confines     her critique to the exclusion of women from the scientific elite, Carolyn     Merchant contrasts the modern scientific worldview which is formed by     the dual concepts of \"mechanism and the domination of nature\" with an     earlier \"organic-oriented mentality\" that held to a nurturing image of     the earth, an image of which the womb, woman/mother are the central referents. 38      According to Merchant, the replacement of this imagery, which survived     as late as the Renaissance, by the mechanical world picture is linked     to commercialization and industrialization, which remain the animus of     our contemporary social world. These images had been a crucial feature     of Western civilization, functioning as an \"ethical constraint\" on mining     and other activities that destroyed the earth. Thus, Merchant historicizes     modern science and, far from conceiving it as \"progressive,\" argues that     it represents a regression from an earlier science that was prevalent     in ancient civilization. \"Violence\" against the earth is consonant with     violence against women, since earth relates to humans as mother to child.     Man's conquest of nature, then, is analogous to dominating women. For     Merchant, it is impossible to abstract the development of modern science     and technology from this process.     This is an example of one     vision of what has become known as the \"feminist standpoint.\" In the     materialist account, the sexual division of labor in which women have been     made subordinate to men in all aspects of their existence -- material     production, social reproduction, especially in their enforced role of     chief, if not sole, child rearer -- has consequences for the character of     knowledge. Knowledge is gender differentiated, according to Nancy     Hartsock, because the sexual division of labor forces women to occupy a     different position in the social structure. 39 This position is     not induced by the biological differences between men and women but is,     instead, socially constructed. She acknowledges these differences but     argues that we can never know the degree to which they might influence, if     not determine, the forms of knowledge until sexual divisions are     abolished.          This is the \"objectivist\" account     of the feminist standpoint insofar as it does not rely for its argument     on the actual consciousness of women. Rather, following Marx and Georg     Lukacs, the structure of Hartsock's argument reiterates the view that     social being determines social consciousness but substitutes women for     the proletariat. Otherwise, one would have to adopt the viewpoint that     knowledge is free of its material preconditions, that there is an unmediated     relationship          25          between the knower and known. Hartsock's central metaphors are those of     political economy, although she draws liberally on the psychoanalytic     literature of object relations as well. Yet, the ideas of commodification,     appropriation, exploitation, and oppression are the crucial analytic categories     in her attempt to establish a specifically feminist discourse or standpoint.          Hartsock does not spell out     the implications of such a view for the relation of gender and science,     but her account bears on the production of knowledge. Even though Hartsock     distances herself from culturalist versions of feminism such as those     offered by Merchant, Mary Daly, and Susan Griffin -- all of whom represent     the fall of civilization in terms of the transformation from maternal,     or female, images and myths to those of masculinity -- she adopts their     theory of knowledge while framing it within Marxist concepts of historical     materialism. Her criteria for the concept of feminist standpoint is totally     derived from the presuppositions of Marxist theory in its Lukacsian form,     including the idea that the standpoint of the exploited or the oppressed     makes possible the unmasking of prevalent social relations that produce     oppressive conditions of life. That there is a specifically woman's experience     of the world is beyond question. What needs to be interrogated, however,     is whether this experience produces a feminist epistemology. Like Merchant,     Hartsock reads masculine epistemology into the history of Western philosophy.     Hegel's master-slave dialectic, in which the self is formed through a     \"life and death struggle,\" is ascribed by Hartsock to class and masculine     relations, thus denying its universality. Males are afflicted with dualistic     consciousness; they live in, but are not of, the family. Their formative     experiences are of an abstract character \"and a denial of the relevance     of the material world to the attainment of what is of fundamental importance:     love of knowledge, or philosophy (masculinity). The duality of nature     and culture takes the form of a devaluation of work, or necessity, and     then primacy instead of a purely social interaction for the attainment     of undying fame.\" 40 Beginning with a materialist account of     women's position in social reproduction, Hartsock finds common ground     with cultural feminism's attack against science as the realm of the abstract     and the identification of women with nature. But she goes further to link     masculinity to the pursuit of knowledge as an abstract ideal. In this     paradigm, women are concerned with the affective realm, men with the cognitive;     women are consigned to the concrete, men to the abstract. Women are nature,     males culture. Of course, these antinomies are the elements of masculine     ideology. But Hartsock does not stop there. For her critique of the          26          antinomies of sexist thought has a point: it is to construct an image     of women that is represented as the real in contrast to the male imaginary:                Women's construction of     self in relation to others leads in an opposite direction --toward     opposition to dualism of any sort; valuation of concrete, everyday life; a     sense of a variety of connectedness and continuities both with other     persons and with the natural world. If material life structures     consciousness, women's relationally defined existence, bodily experience     of boundary challenges, and activity of transforming both physical objects     and human beings must be expected to result in a world view to which     dichotomies are foreign. 41      In other words, there is a     feminist standpoint which radically transforms the nature of     knowledge. This is so because science derives from its philosophical     presuppositions, which, if we are to follow Hartsock's logic, are rooted     in the conditions of material existence. Hartsock omits discussion of the     concrete knowledge that can be derived from this standpoint and of the     degree to which it would differ from that proposed by the male worldview;     she does not provide a method for arriving at that knowledge. For the     present, we must confine ourselves to the structure of her argument.     Hartsock's critique, unlike those of ecofeminism and cultural feminism,     stands firmly on the twin sciences of psychoanalysis and Marxist theory of     historical change, historical materialism. These are, of course,     derivative of the abstract, universal premises of enlightenment philosophy     of science. For both, the self is constructed out of the manifold     relations into which it enters; it is not a thing, sui generis. Freud and Marx share     the idea that the self is a reified construction masking deeper relations     that are to be uncovered by scientific investigation. In each case,     we are constrained to employ abstract, a priori categories such as the     psychic structure with its three parts (Freud) or the mode of production of     material life with its two elements being forces and relations of     production (Marx). In each case, the domination of nature becomes the     precondition for the formation of self; it is the structuring relation     within which class or psychic relations fight it out. So, if we are     to follow Hartsock, her own theoretical sources are intimately entwined     with masculine forms of knowledge, and the price of appropriating these     modes of knowing must be calculated. Her own description of the categories     of the feminist epistemology are strikingly similar to those produced     by the cultural feminists. Women are concrete; their relation to     nature is continuous rather than dualistic; \"dichotomies are foreign\"     to their way of     27   knowing. These conclusions     also appear in the discourses of Merchant, Daly, and Griffin,     although they make no claim to follow the precepts of male-oriented     science. Instead, they offer an alternative myth to that of science: the     ancient times were a golden age when feminist ways of relating to nature     were dominant. Then, \"commercialism and industrialism\" signaled a fall     from grace or, in Daly's account, patriarchy appeared as a violent     counterrevolution to maternal culture. 42 Merchant's apocryphal,     utopian history becomes a weapon in the feminist struggle against     male science. Premodernity, regarded by the Enlightenment as a static and     reactionary worldview, becomes, for this version of the feminist     standpoint, a science that views the \"cosmos as a living unit\" in which     humans were linked both to the heavens and to other animals. Aristotle,     whose cosmology became the object for refutation by     seventeenth-century science, is here regarded as a flawed but essentially     ecological thinker. Merchant does not render the history of the     transformation of science as a struggle of ideas. As I have noted, she     points to material, economic reasons for the changing assumptions of     science. But since she adopts a frankly utopian and political standpoint,     her account of the \"death of nature\" does not rely on material categories     of causality. Instead, she weaves myth and science together in a     mosaic that takes ideas seriously as historical agents. Hartsock, on the     other hand, manifests the contradiction of a logocentric method with     feminist ideology of organicism.          In a future work, I explore     the substance of feminist and ecological claims about science. For the     present, it is sufficient to open the discussion. Religious, ecological,     and cultural feminist objections to modern science differ in many ways.     What unites them is their condemnation of the failure of science to come     to terms with its own social and political commitment. The virtue of feminist     critiques of science is that they try to go beyond the tendency prevalent     among ecologists, environmentalists, and others, to confine their objections     to the uses without challenging the philosophical presuppositions of science     the content of contemporary scientific theories, or the methods of science.     Merchant has provided a critique, parallel to that of the Frankfurt School,     which focuses on the metaphysical foundations of modern science and suggests,     following the lead of Adrienne Rich that the pejorative metaphor of women     as \"other\" to male reason \"divested of the trappings of patriarchy, gives     rise to a distinctively female bond with nature.\" 43 If the     feminist critique of science as a but not the form of reason     is right, it may occupy no privileged position with respect to knowledge     of nature. It is a way of knowing, burdened with presuppositions permeated     with the interest of (male) domination of women/na-          28          ture. These presuppositions, derived from the social world, configure     its results. Thus, we may subject the scientific method to scrutiny as     well as the overwhelming tendency of some strains of physics and biology     toward reductionism, especially their denial of the concepts of levels     according to which biology, psychology, and social science are discourses     whose object of knowledge is irreducible to physical and chemical properties.     For feminism, the problems of social relations are not subsumed by basic     biological drives, which, in turn, are derived from \"organic chemical     reactions.\" At the same time, the feminist standpoint invokes metaphors     of women's physiology to describe nature.          In sum, the mechanical and reductionist     worldview of natural science is under siege from three major movements     that have questioned the gulf separating scientific knowledge from moral     and ethical considerations. Among the weapons of criticism employed by     these movements, none is more powerful than the readings of the canon     of scientific philosophy since the post-Socratics. The evidence of what     Max Black calls \"models and metaphors\" in the laws of science reveal the     extent to which the categories of myth still pervade science and, particularly,     its inability to eliminate human purpose from the multiple issues surrounding     scientific discovery.     To be sure, science itself has     provided the impetus for much of this work. For, as historians and     philosophers of science have tried to demonstrate, recent profound     changes in the scientific picture of the world have reinserted the subject     into scientific discovery, have revived once hated theories, and have     introduced uncertainty about the question whether science \"needs\" a     teleological hypothesis to explain its discoveries. The reinstatement     of teleology and neo-Lamarckian ideas in biology, uncertainty in physics,     parapsychology and the religious connection to the big bang theory in     cosmology points to scientific communities that are philosophically     and even metaphysically rent. While the public face of science remains     resolutely rationalistic, doubt is creeping in; some scientists have     launched their own movement against corporate and military control over     research, demanding once again a return to the autonomy of scientific     work. And, as was true of physics and biology in the past, the merger of     theoretical science with philosophy has reappeared, even as some     philosophers of science insist that they have nothing to offer the     acquisition of positive knowledge -- their role is merely to clear up     misunderstandings.          Since the relativity and quantum     mechanics debates of the first third of the twentieth century, in which     theoretical physicists openly clashed on questions of interpretation of     the results of discovery, historians,          29          sociologists, and even a few philosophers of science have been given \"permission\"     to interrogate science and to suggest, however meekly, that there are     ideological elements of scientific theory. I shall discuss these developments     in some detail in Part III. For now, it is enough to remark that there     exists widespread skepticism concerning the autonomy of science within     the scientific community itself as well as social movements and a section     of the populations of industrialized countries. Some scientists, philosophers,     and social scientists are exploring the historical and social constitution     of science, especially the \"facts\" that constitute scientific knowledge.     They have concluded, in various ways, that what might be called the \"social     relations\" of science, including the worldviews that are constitutive     of scientific knowledge, are inseparable from the results of discovery.     The philosophy, history, and sociology of science explores the claim of     modern science (a) to be independent of the social/historical context     within which it works and (b) to discover \"facts\" that, even if theory-dependent,     correspond to the external world. The first debate concerns the autonomy     of science from the conditions of the production of knowledge. Since Thomas     Kuhn's suggestion (1962) that paradigm shifts in science were dependent     not only on \"shifts in perceptions,\" a concept borrowed from N. Hanson     (1958), 44 but also upon changes in the context within which     scientific discovery took place, historians and sociologists of science     have tried to get a handle on these presumably \"external\" influences upon     scientific development. Those who wish to preserve the fundamental autonomy     of science, such as Koyre, Hanson, and Kuhn himself, confine these extraideational     influences to the scientific community, defined variously in broader terms,     or, as in some recent sociological histories and studies, to the laboratory. 45      The exceptions (see Paul Forman, 1971) 46 speak of an     episteme, or cultural environment, that may influence the content of scientific     theory. However, only Marxism has provided a social/historical interpretation     that encompasses both science and technology, explaining their development     in relation to large economic, political, and ideological transformations.          Perhaps it was the mechanical     correspondence theory of scientific truth employed by Marxism after Marx     that resulted in the deafening silence with which mainstream philosophers,     historians, and social scientists greeted its accounts. When Marx and     the Marxists are discussed, it is only to dismiss them as in Koyre's summary     refutation cited above. The mainstream tradition in the sociology of science,     represented by Robert Merton and the Columbia school, confines its explorations     of the social context of science to studies of the scientific community,     particularly \"institutional and ethical factors\" such as the          30          character of scientific education, and networks of personal relations     based on schools attended and scientific organizations. 47 Even     the \"new social studies in science,\" -- grouped around the Edinburgh School     (Barry Barnes, David Bloor), Michael Mulkey, Karin Knorr-Cetina, and,     in a somewhat different vein, Steve Woolgar and Bruno Latour -- have,     in the name of abolishing the dichotomy between internalist and externalist     explanations, fashioned a microsociology of knowledge in which the actual     interactions of working scientists, their discourse concerning observations,     and their negotiations as to what they actually \"saw\" constitute scientific     facts. 48 These accounts differ from Mertonian sociology insofar     as the social studies school argues in various ways that scientific facts     are constructed socially, but the scientific community is often made nearly     identical with the social. In this connection, one of the dominant strains     of the social study of science has become ethnomethodology, a derivative     of phenomenology; recent sociology of science seeks to actually locate     the point of production of scientific knowledge as the outcome of intersubjectivity.     In recent times, only the Edinburgh School and Bruno Latour attempt to     link scientific knowledge with social interest, owing much in this respect     to the Marxist and neo-Marxist conceptions of ideology.          Although social studies of science,     including the older work of Merton, do not ignore Marxism, it is also     true that the historical perspective on science and technology that has     been closely identified with the Marxist tradition is marginal to this     work. As I shall show in Part III, historiographic works on science, following     Koyre and Kuhn, remain embedded in the problem of intertextuality, that     is, the relation of scientific ideas to philosophy, or, more broadly,     the prevailing mentality of a historical period. Missing in these accounts     are concrete studies in the social relations of science that go beyond     the laboratory or professional contexts within which scientists act.     In Part 1, I discuss the     theory of scientific discovery emanating from Marx and Engels. As we shall     see, controversies concerning this question within Marxism reveal     differences of interpretation as wide as those in the philosophy of     science and technology. Moreover, as I shall show, Marxism, following     Marx's own ambivalence, mirrors the debates in every discipline concerning     the general question of what constitutes science; the relevance of social     relations to the form and substance of scientific knowledge, that is, to     what counts as knowledge; and, more broadly, the relation of science to     what is called \"society.\"          I follow with an examination     of the Marxist tradition, in its \"orthodox\" version emanating from the     theorists of the Second and          31          Third Internationals as well as from those who may be designated as \"neo-Marxist.\"     My main point in Part II is that the transformations within Marxism tend     to follow changes in mentalities that accompany both social and cultural     developments and the ideologies embedded within them. Like natural science     itself, Marxism is not immune from the controversies of the time(s) within     which it theorizes social and natural phenomena.          At the same time, Marxism is     constantly confronted with a disruption not experienced by other perspectives.     This consists in the problem of reconciling its own claim to be a \"science,\"     in the sense of nineteenth-century physics or chemistry, with its equally     powerful axiomatic proposition that nature and history are constituted     by the social relations of production, and that the production of the     material means of social existence is at the same time the production     of humans themselves (including their mental life). Thus, if social production     is not merely the instrument through which humans survive the vicissitudes     of their external environment but constitutes the multiplicity of their     social relations, Marxism provides the clue to a radically different conception     of scientific knowledge than is contained in its own aspirations. For,     under this axiom, not only science, but Marxism itself, must be comprehended     within the framework of social relations. Both its axiomatic and its theoretical     structures must be understood as aspects of prevailing relations of production.     In this regard, the referent of scientific knowledge, is not only the     object of investigation or, as in recently discovered quantum mechanics,     the observer, but also the social matrix within which modes of thought     are constituted. That most of the leading theorists of science and technology     in the Marxist perspective have been unable to situate their own \"paradigm\"     reflexively, that is, to understand the extent to which Marxist science     contains ideological elements or, at the very least, is dependent upon     the character of those relations that constitute it, attests to the power     of the enlightenment faith that nature (and human nature) may be comprehended     directly. As I shall show in Part 11, on neo-Marxist science and Soviet     science, even when they acknowledge the social constitution of scientific     facts, the historical relativity of scientific knowledge is attenuated     by a strict adherence to a realist epistemology; according to which the     correspondence of Scientific propositions to the material world may be     established through experimental or mathematical proofs. There are, of     course, exceptions, but these have had little lasting influence on Marxism     as an intellectual movement.          One may notice striking commensurabilities     with this development in the non-Marxist historiography, sociology, and     philosophy of sci-          32          ence as well as among scientists themselves, especially those who are     also philosophers. To acknowledge that the production of knowledge is     a social process has not been commonplace in discourses on science; however,     since Kuhn, the idea is becoming more respectable. Yet, of the major movements     of thought originating in the nineteenth century, only Marxism can account     theoretically for this development (the exceptions, poststructuralist     philosophy and historiography and the sociology of knowledge, are in fundamental     respects derivative of Marxism, even if by negation). At the same time,     the countervailing tendency within Marxism toward totality bars a wholehearted     historical relativism.          Nevertheless, whereas Kuhn,     for example, alludes to social     and cultural influences on paradigm shifts in science, Marxism specifies     these in terms of economic, political, and ideological determinants. And,     it is precisely because Marx himself generates categories that make a     social analysis of science and technology possible, that Marxism, despite     its ambivalence, has produced the only coherent social theory of science,     a theory which has scandalized its opponents (for example, Karl Popper).     Only recently, however, have some working in the Marxist tradition been     willing to extend theory to the production of scientific knowledge. Others,     notably the structuralist and analytic schools, have directed their energies     to affirming Marxism 's scientificity by declaring that the social aspects     in its development are of little or no interest, except insofar as they     illuminate the degree to which Marxist propositions conform to canon of     scientific evidence and proof.          In chapters 2 and 3 I examine,     in detail, Marx's theory of science and technology. Except for comments     in letters and his notes for Capital      published as the Grundrisse,      Marx offers no separate theory of science and technology. Rather,     his theory is imbedded, almost coded, in the rich description of the labor     process developed in the first volume of Capital and in the crucial sections     on accumulation. As we shall see, Marx understands science in terms of     the domination of capital over labor. Science is subsumed under capital     in the period of the transformation of the labor process from manufacturing     to modern industrial production. Chapter 4 traces the subtle shift in     Marxist theory of science from its role in production to an epistemological     inquiry closely connected to the status of Marxism itself as a science,     and also considers the role of the productive forces in the transition     from capitalism to socialism, a preponderant concern of leading theorists     of early twentieth-century socialism, who, taking Marx literally, foresaw     that the role of science in the new social order would be even more central     than it had hitherto been in advanced capitalist societies.          33          In chapter 5, I take up the work of the Frankfurt School, which, having     taken seriously Lukacs's insistence that nature was a social category     and science ineluctably entwined with social relations, returns to the     historical focus of Marx himself. But now, the shift away from considerations     of the labor process is definitive. Rather -- like Lukacs, Horkheimer,     and Adorno -- Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel, whose theory of science is deeply     influenced by the Frankfurt critique of science, undertake an examination     of the ideological aspects of scientific assumptions and discoveries.     However, whereas Sohn-Rethel retains Lukacs's focus on the commodity form,     the Frankfurt School presupposes Marx's categories and adopts a Weberian     emphasis on forms of rationality. Chapter 6 shows how later theorists,     particularly Habermas, want to find pathways back to reason but no longer     find them through the route of science. In effect, for Habermas, science     and technology have become part of the taken-for-granted world of instrumental     reason. His is a postindustrial theory of communication that seeks to     address the problems of social relations through language. In Chapter     7 I discuss the full-throated emergence of a Marxist epistemology introduced     by Althusser through the influences of Jacques Lacan and particularly     Gaston Bachelard. I also show the affinity of this tendency with the Italian     school emanating from Galvano Della Volpe. Finally, perhaps the apogee     of this new Marxist scientism is the most recent development of analytic     Marxism, which wants to articulate Marxism with normal, positivistic scientific     method. Chapter 8 explores the history of Soviet ideology of science,     an ideology that has become official state doctrine. I show that Soviet     views of science, while ensconced in orthodox Marxist presuppositions,     parallel tendencies in non-Marxist theories of science as well.          Part III traces parallel developments     in non-Marxist discourses on science. Here, we shall see the battle joined     principally at the epistemological level, since those perspectives that     I loosely group under the tentative rubric of liberalism have no specific      social theory of economic,     political, or scientific discourse. In fact, I argue that a distinction     between Marxism and liberalism at the ideological level lies precisely     in the absence of a distinctive liberal social theory of science. Since     enlightenment ideology, especially its scientific and technological modes,     proceeds from the presuppositions of individually driven market relations,     on the one hand, and claims concerning the universality of reason, on     the other, social theory is occluded from this antinomy. At most, liberalism     appropriates conservative communitarianism as a social site. But indigenous     liberalism implies that society is constituted by individuals and that     individual choice is the foundation          34          of collective association. Thus, the sociological conception of the \"scientific     community\" as the site of scientific discovery and the court of scientific     truth. In turn, the scientific community is composed of associated individuals     united by their training and knowledge, a unity which makes possible the     determination of whether any assertion is scientifically valid.          Clearly, this conception of     the social derives from possessive individualism. There are really no     \"structures\" of social life, no relations that transcend individual determination.     More recently, Michel Foucault has advanced the idea of discursive formation     which links social groups to discourses arranged spatially. Foucault's     insistence on the inextricable link between knowledge and power suggests     that various discursive communities are also political/economic formations     and, more generally, that what counts as knowledge is entwined with domination.     Although Foucault is usually catalogued within post-Marxism, there is     no question that the referent is still historical materialism, even if     the primacy of the economic is denied.          However, there can be no returning     to the letter of historical materialist theories as they were articulated     by Marx and Engels. For as we shall see, both are imbued with the enlightenment     ideal of science as somehow resistant to the infusion of the ideologies     produced in course of the production and reproduction of capitalist social     relations. This view is attributable not only to the context in which     studies of language and discourse as sources of ideology were still in     their infancy, but also to the problems posed by evolutionist ideology.     According to this ideology, humans stand at the pinnacle of the natural     order; their unique stature is owed to their capacity to produce means     of subsistence, and thereby to produce their life. In the production of     all aspects of existence, science is the master discourse and Marxism     underscores itself as the authentic representation of mastery in the social     field, and, as metascience, in the so-called natural field as well.     At issue in this book are both     propositions and evolutionary ideology: I argue that science is a labor     process like others; that its practices constitute an intervention of a     specific kind, whose contrast with types of social and natural     interventions cannot be arranged hierarchically on a scale of truth or     adequacy; and finally that science is a discourse that narrates the world     in a special way."}]},

Minneapolis            CHAPTER     1 SCIENCE AND       TECHNOLOGY     AS HEGEMONY            When my daughter Nona was two     years old, she frequently exclaimed, after a fall, \"the chair did it,\" or,     as she bumped into the wall, \"the wall did it.\" On September 11, 1986, the     New York stock market plunged eighty-six points. The next day, after a     drop of thirty-four points, a New     York Times story read, \"wide use of computers contributed to slide.\"     According to the writer, trading on the stock market is often detonated by     signals supplied by a computer program. It's a \"split second\"     automatic process; in appearance, at least, large institutional     traders such as pension plans and major banks respond to the slightest     movement of interest rates without significant reflection. On this     particular day, when stock traders came to their offices, \"they were met     by a big jump in interest rates . . . (which) immediately dragged down the     price of futures contracts for stocks.\" 1 This triggered sales     of current stocks by the money managers and widespread purchases of     futures contracts. As the large investors unloaded stocks, others followed     suit and stock prices plummeted. The investors respond to the computer as     my daughter might explain bumping into the wall. Of course, the Times and the analysts they     consulted allowed that national and international economic troubles might     be an underlying influence on the serious fall of stock prices that week,     but from the point of view of investors, it was their computer that seemed     to make the decision to sell.     That we live in a computer age     no one seems to doubt. Yet, along with the paeans of praise heaped upon     this electronic device, there is   4         also a growing chorus of     criticism and a pervasive mood of doubt about its redemptive features.     Actually, the computer is now widely viewed as more than a tool, after     three decades during which many of its proponents attempted to assure us     that, despite its considerable power, it is really an extension of the     human head and hand and has no autonomy. However, in recent years, this     view has been sharply attacked by experimental computer research, on the     one side, and by the practice of those who interact with it, on the other.     There are those like Herbert Simon who impute to it almost mystical     powers, the pinnacle of which is the ability of computers to think     (of course, in order to prove this proposition, Simon was forced to define     humans as \"information processors\"-a more complex conception would     certainly defeat his theory). 2 Artificial intelligence     research seeks to find ways to solve the age-old dilemma of uncertainty in     human action which has plagued the labor process, politics, and vast areas     of social life. Machines that     think are more reliably subject to prediction and     control.     But the computer seems to have     a mind of its own, especially if the controllers are guided by its     information. Many, including some computer scientists, have already     begun to compare computers to the Golem of the medieval ghetto or the     monster created by Dr. Frankenstein. Far from remaining a stunning     but subordinate tool, the computer frequently jumps the track,     subverting human purposes that set it in motion. Like the machines that     characterized the Industrial Revolution, computers are just the     latest occasion for the displacement of fears that \"things\" are out of     control, that their human origin has been lost, and that it is too late     for salvation.     My stock market example is by     no means the heart of the matter. For those who would not speak of     Chernobyl or Three Mile Island should also keep silent about the wonders     of technology. Naturally, those who continue to defend the use of nuclear     technology for supplying power attribute the problems at these sites to     \"human error,\" just as Union Carbide company officials blamed workers and     inadequate supervision for the disaster at Bhopal, India, in December 1984     which killed several thousand people and injured another     200,000. 3 The phrase \"human error\" usually refers to those who     operate equipment; when an airplane crashes, the pilot or maintenance     mechanic is nearly always blamed. Almost never is \"human error\" blamed on     the design of the aircraft or the basic judgment that nuclear energy is a     safe bet. When technology is involved, managers and the media rarely ask     whether the premises of the machine in question are valid. For example,     government officials are prepared to ask whether an adequate     evacuation   5     plan has been devised by a company operating a nuclear reactor;     the technique of generating nuclear energy or producing nuclear weapons is     beyond the competence of regulatory agencies because promoting nuclear     energy is national policy.          There are many reasons why nuclear     power and air travel became privileged technologies in fuel production     and transportation. I do not wish to dispute the economic and political     arguments employed by corporations to persuade the many governments, including     that of the United States, that these technologies were more efficient     than existing means of energy production. For our purposes, the criterion     of efficiency is closely linked to concepts such as cost savings, whose     major component is saving time-time in the extraction of raw materials     from the earth, a labor-intensive activity, or, concomitantly, the time     saved by traveling 650 miles per hour rather than 100 or 200 miles per     hour, the current maximum of rail transportation. Yet, rails have suffered     at the hands of trucks which are, by any conventional standard, more energy-wasteful     than trains. The contradictory arguments made on behalf of various methods     of transport belie pure efficiency criteria: it may be that choices of     technology are made entirely independent of \"rational\" production decisions     but obey a different rationality, the power imperative.     Some students of the     introduction of nuclear energy technology in advanced industrial societies     have raised an entirely different set of arguments why this dangerous,     even disastrous, way of obtaining energy has received such powerful     support. The argument is that the decisions to \"go nuclear\" transcend any     possible rational criteria, measured by economic or technical     considerations. Instead, these critics claim that the basic impetus for     the introduction of nuclear-powered energy is rooted in the hierarchical     structure of society. Those at the pinnacle are able to impose a logic of domination on the rest of     us by simply repeating their falsehoods through every avenue of public     debate and discourse. This explanation removes the discussion of     causality from the domain of instrumental reason. It is not this or     that interest that has triumphed, tragically, in the corridors of power.     Power itself carries its own demand, which exceeds, with impunity, the     boundaries of reason. In effect, power sets new rational codes without     reference to ideology.          If this is true, none of the     by now conventional rational criticisms are adequate to the situation.     One convention is to show that some interests can expect to reap huge     profits from the introduction of certain technologies. Another appeals     to the cult of efficiency as the supreme instrumental arbiter of social     choice. Each of these positions generates          6          a concomitant ideology or justification of action. The notion of power     as the arbiter requires no independent ideology to accompany it. By virtue     of its command over knowledge, it can manufacture justification to the     extent that the need for justification remains necessary in mass democracies.     For example, human survival is threatened by another major scientific/technological     development: genetic engineering, the technological concomitant of discoveries     generated by molecular biology. Gene splicing is a eugenic technoscience;     its justification is almost invariably built on the proposal to improve     the survival traits of the species by designing the gene rather than passively     accepting genetically related traits as unavoidable. Genetic engineering     is an intervention into evolution, an attempt to gain control over life     processes.          These examples are not, strictly     speaking, commensurable but are invoked to illustrate the range of issues     that are emerging to question technology and its twin, modern science.     Now the statement that science and technology have become inseparable     is certainly controversial, especially among those who would insist that     science is autonomous from the concerns of power and ideology. The division     between science and technology is meant to protect science from its implication     in the matrix of economic and political considerations, which are generally     recognized to influence - if not determine - the course of technological     development and its dispersion. It is still true, however, that most students     of science, while acknowledging the influence of what is often labeled     \"cultural factors\" on the process of knowledge acquisition, insist that     economic, political, and ideological questions must be strictly demarcated     from considerations bearing on the content of scientific knowledge. Instead,     the term \"scientific community\" has become identical with \"social context.\"     Indeed, recent developments in the social study of science have narrowed     this context to the laboratory, leaving other \"external\" influences aside.     Despite developments over the past thirty years which try to establish     a relation between scientific discourses and the historical and other     social conditions within which they function, support for the proposition     that science and the scientific milieu is relatively autonomous is still     powerful. In Part III, I shall explore developments in the philosophy,     history, and social study of science that have challenged the idea that     what counts as knowledge of the external world is attained by means of     scientific procedures alone. As we shall see, most investigators of science     remain tied to the concept of science as a distinct knowledge sphere and     have barely touched its relation to technology. The great exception, of     course, is Critical Theory, the foundation of which is to establish this          7          link and to assert the dominance of technology over science as well as     its domination over contemporary social relations.          The assertion that Western culture     is thoroughly technological derives from the German \"romantic\" critique     of the Enlightenment, a critique which members of the Frankfurt School     share with strains of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century neo-Kantian     thought, especially Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. After arguing     that the \"rationalism of the Age of Enlightenment is now out of the question,\"     Husserl nevertheless is quick to add, \"but their [the Enlightenment philosophies]     intention, in its most general sense, must never die out in us\"; the intention     is a \"humanity based on pure reason.\" 4 Max Horkheimer and Theodor     Adorno follow a similar line of argument. They lament the Enlightenment,     which created a new science and technology that could dominate nature     in order to promote the flowering of reason, but that led instead to its     eclipse. The end of reason was rooted in the belief, current even today,     that nature could be reduced to pure object, possessing mere quantitative     extension. The mathematicization and mechanization of the world picture     was undertaken by seventeenth-century science in the service of prediction     and control. In the process, according to Husserl, we lost contact with     the \"life world\" in a series of dualisms: mind and body, quantity and     quality, mathematic relations and human relations. For the Frankfurt School,     the logical result was positivism - the alienation of human reason from     itself.          Whereas Husserl's critique remains     at the level of philosophic discourse, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Herbert     Marcuse ascribed these dichotomies to the rending of society by social     domination. The domination of nature fulfills a human project, the domination     of people by people. Science and technology are practices that mirror     the social world.          Still, the Frankfurt School     was criticizing the enlightenment from within. Although Marcuse was     ambiguous concerning science, claiming at one point that a new science     free of technological domination needed to be created, he proclaims in     the final chapter of his One Dimensional Man that science     and technology \"are great vehicles of liberation\" if only they can be     subordinated to new ends to replace those of domination. These ends \"would     operate in the project and construction of machinery and not only in its     utilization.\" Technology can be instrumental \"in the reduction of toil     - it remains the very base of all forms of human freedom.\" 6 Thus,     the sharpest critics of science and technology hesitate at the door of     irrationalism and will not cross the threshhold, however harsh their evaluation     of the gloomy record          8          of domination that lies in the wake of modern science and technology.     On the other side, of course, lies reason's nemesis: religion, mysticism,     myth.          The warfare between what has     been called \"science\" and other discourses that purport to explain the     natural and social worlds is a story many times told. As Gaston Bachelard     has argued, science is constituted by its break from competing discourses     that claim to explain the same objects. 7 Physics, for example,     breaks with forms of \"irrationalism\" but also with metaphysics. As Bachelard's     contemporary, Karl Popper, has commented, \"metaphysics offers meanings     that may be helpful to other aspects of human affairs, but not science. 8     Science, for Popper and Bachelard, is established by statements that can     be subjected to refutation (in Bachelard's terms, \"empirical validation\").     It is the spirit and practice of relentless self-criticism that marks     science off from other discourses, including traditional philosophy. For     recent philosophers of science, even these procedures do not guarantee     that the results are identical with \"truth,\" only that they are demarcated     thereby from other discourses. Within true science, there may be serious     and often profound disputes of interpretation. But what all scientists     share is a community rooted     in method. The primacy of shared methods guarantees the reliability of     what counts as science. In Parts II and III we shall explore these assertions     in more detail. For now, it is enough to suggest that what those dedicated     to Western scientific ideology mean by the term \"science\" reduces to two     procedures: mathematical calculation and experimental validation/falsification     of results. Mathematics ensures the rigor of investigation, establishing     measurable relations and, in Bachelard's words, \"gives body to pure thought.\"     Mathematics is \"the realization of the rational.\" However, lest science     fall victim to Descartes's unwarranted \"refusal to base thought on experience,\"     experimentalism restores to observation its role as final arbiter of knowledge. 9           Presumably, neither philosophy     nor religion fulfills either of these criteria. Modern science demarcates     itself, not by reconstituting the object, but by defining rationality     in a specific way. At the same time, given the power of all metaphysical     discourses in everyday life, it is obliged to make room for the extrascientific     so long as these spheres are clearly subordinated to scientific rationality.     In the knowledge hierarchies of postfeudal societies, modern scientific     rationality is the privileged discourse, and. all others are relegated     to the margins. As a result, institutions of the state as well as the     economy -- education systems, government bureaus, the law and criminal     justice systems -- emulate scientific procedures within the constraints     imposed by their          9          own traditions and exigencies. Art and religion hold their places at the     margins of human endeavor and become extracurricular, or, to use Freud's     term, \"deflections,\" for the frustrations produced by the inhibition of     desire by the reality principle. 10           The rise of Protestantism in     leading industrializing countries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries     seemed to provide moral sanction for the preeminent position of modern     science as knowledge. Religious institutions now viewed themselves as     supplicants in an increasingly secular age and understood their role not     so much as deflectors but as moral guardians for individuals damaged by     the blandishments of money and power. The type of knowledge offered by     religion was confined to the ethical sphere; it concerned itself with     matters of family life, personal grief, and, when it felt obliged to take     social action, it was remedial rather than transformative. The great denominations     of Protestantism relinquished that which Catholicism had struggled to     retain: a claim on epistemological as well as ontological truth. However,     in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the triumph of world capitalism     over the remnants of the old feudal aristocracy in eastern and southern     Europe forced even the recalcitrant Catholic and other orthodox churches     to accommodate to the new order.          By the late nineteenth century,     industrial production depended on scientifically based technologies; the     craft traditions, of which early manufacturing was merely a form of rationalization,     were themselves subordinated to the new technology; the motive force of     production, energy, was no longer mechanical -- really an extension of     hand or water power -- but became electrical, the principles of which     derived from \"pure research\"; engineering replaced artisanal knowledge     in designing the mode of transformation of raw materials into end products;     in turn, the intellectual foundation of engineering became physics and     chemistry, which themselves were institutionalized into large laboratories     sponsored by and controlled by the state and large corporations. Thus,     science itself no longer is only a hegemonic ideology of the new social     order of capitalism and its industrial stage, but becomes integrated into     the practices and discourses of production. The inter-changeability of     science and technology is, of course, either denied or ignored by most     philosophers and scientists, but their growing convergence extends beyond     the workplace. 11 As scientific discourse permeates state and     civil society, scientific culture spills over beyond the laboratory. Business     dares make no decisions that are not grounded on mathematical calculation     that provides projections; legislators enact laws based on \"data\" generated     by scientifically trained experts Raymond Callahan has noted, referring     to education, that technological          10          criterion of efficiency becomes the new cult of public and private schools. 12      In schools, the idea of the liberal arts slowly gives way to occupational     education. \"Functional\" literacy becomes the criterion of success for     no-frills state school systems that are stripped of their music and drawing     curricula and which reduce English and history to service departments     for the technical-oriented programs. Therefore, in several dramatic moments     since World War II, beefing up science and math in schools has become     a matter of high government priority since these disciplines are understood     to be vital for a country's economic and military position in an increasingly     competitive and dangerous world.          Science education is accorded,     in the current anxiety over the loss of America's erstwhile preeminence     in industrial production, a primary role in the long road to restoration.     In the 1980s, as the defense budget of the United States has increased     dramatically, engineers and scientists are in demand in military-related     industries. Consequently, despite enormous pressure from government and     industry on schools, teacher recruitment in science and math has lagged,     primarily because salaries are far below those offered by private industry     and research institutions. Reversing its steadfast policy of reducing     federal expenditures and advocacy of scaled-down public services at all     levels, the Reagan administration saw the virtue of making an exception     for the teaching of science and math.          These illustrations do not exhaust     the extent to which technological culture penetrates the social world.     Right after World War II, as America assumed a position of economic, political,     and military dominance in the world, secularism -- always closely related     to the growth of modern science and technology -- seemed to have triumphed,     irrevocably, in the cultural sphere as well. Church attendance dropped     sharply, and religion in this most religious of modernized societies seemed     finally on the wane, a century after its final marginalization in most     industrialized European countries. 13           Technological culture may not     provide salve for the spirit, and it may do nothing to fill the void left     by the marginalization of religious morality, but, as even its most severe     critics are forced to admit, it gives rein to the pleasure principle.     As Marcuse observed, in advanced capitalist societies, especially the     United States, \"the defense structure makes life easier for a greater     number of people and extends man's mastery over nature.\" 14 Although     his description of technological society as a \"comfortable, smooth, democratic     unfreedom\" was adopted by some as a reason for opposing the prevailing     setup, millions who had been condemned to deprivation during the decades     of industrialization wel comed technology as a savior.          11           Culture was massified, overtaking high art     and marginalizing the intellectuals for whom it was sustenance, but providing     a respite from the drudgery of even the most automated labor. Marcuse     may have spoken for more than the intellectuals. His remorse for the contradictions     of the Enlightenment finally paled against the achievements of science     and technology. As a child of reason, he was unable to draw the logical     conclusion from his critique that science and technology had become obstacles     to freedom. Writing in the early 1960s, he could only allow that a transformed     science and technology might serve the emancipatory interest better than     the version that had emerged from the Dark Ages.          Goethe once quipped, \"He who     possesses science and art also has religion; but he who possesses neither     of these two, let him have religion.\" 15 The vision is a thoroughly     pluralist one. Science and art are to exist alongside religion, which     as Freud noted, echoing Goethe, was the possession of everyman, defined     as someone lacking the means to sublimate the irrepressible pleasure principle.     For the nineteenth-century poet or scientist, the idea that religion would     one more time raise its claim to yield reliable knowledge of the external     natural world was unthinkable. Freud is quite clear: the belief in the     supernatural is an \"untenable\" doctrine but better for the common folk     than alcohol or drugs. Just as long as it is not taken seriously as more     than an opiate. 16           But this is precisely what has     transpired in the past decade. Despite the unambiguous triumph of the     scientific worldview and the totalizing effects of technology, science     and technology are experiencing unprecedented attack. For the past fifteen     years, counterenlightenment religious movements have taken on worldwide     and revolutionary proportions. Far from disdaining politics as beneath     their ethical missions, some Jews, Moslems, and Christians alike have     laid siege to the state, demanding that public life conform to religious     precepts and that the separation of church and state be ended. The theocratic     state, once consigned by scholars, politicians, and jurists to the past,     is loudly proclaimed as the present and future by the new movements, and     has already captured important outposts in the Middle East -- within the     Moslem, Christian and Jewish worlds -- and is rapidly becoming the sine     qua non of political victory for parties in the United States. 17      Here, it is not only that lawmakers adopt biblical criteria for     establishing the rules of punishment; this is an old story in America.     The doctrine of retribution opposes itself to the idea that the criminal     may be subject to rehabilitation. In retrospect, liberal assumptions about     crime seem a brief interlude in an unbroken history of deep-seated, religiously     based conservatism in American law and political          12          life. Fundamentalist theology is reentering the public schools as well.     And among its adversaries, none is more significant than modern science.     As biologist Douglas Futuyama has warned, science is \"on trial\" and reason     is \"under fire.\" 18 A new science of creationism has challenged     the exclusive teaching of evolution in public schools and demanded that     its \"science\" be given equal treatment. This is no longer merely a case     of the ministry getting involved in politics, supporting candidates who     favor state aid to parochial schools. Such requests, made by the Catholic     Church for decades, challenge the separation of church and state but do     not confront the ideological hegemony of modern scientific doctrine. Indeed,     many parochial schools of Catholic and Protestant origins teach modern     science and mathematics as necessary elements of a relevant curriculum,     relevant, that is, to the job and career aspirations of their own constituencies.     The fundamental distinction between the old political intervention of     religious institutions, either on behalf of social justice or their own     parochial interests, and the new fundamentalism is that the latter condemns     enlightenment science as ideology, as one viewpoint in a plurality of     discourses possessing no privileged knowledge of the external world. Thus,     its demand for an equal place in the curriculum. In essence, fundamentalism     has stepped forward where enlightenment critics of science have stepped     back. For the purposes of this discussion, it is not relevant to point     out the absurdities of the creationist account of the origins of the universe,     life, and the evolution of species. At issue is the claim of enlightenment     science to certainty and its refusal to acknowledge its own discourse     as a form of ideology.          Take a case in point. In the     course of his attack against creationist accounts of development, Futuyama     makes two arguments: \"anyone who believes in Genesis as a literal description     of history must hold a world view that is entirely incompatible with the     idea of evolution, not to speak of science itself. . . where science insists     on material, mechanistic causes that can be understood by physics and     chemistry, the literal believer in Genesis invokes unknowable supernatural     forces.\" 19           The second argument is, for     Futuyama, more important: \"if the world and its creatures developed purely     by material, physical forces, it could not have been designed and has     no purpose or goal. The fundamentalist, in contrast, believes that everything     in the world, every species and every characteristic of every species,     was designed by an intelligent, purposeful artificer, and that it was     made for a purpose.\" 20 Futuyama defends evolution and the whole     of science as holding that \"mechanisms,\" not teleology, govern events     in nature. These mechanisms free science from reliance on Aristotelian     final causes and rely          13          instead on the sufficiency of efficient causes. Changes within and among     species can be ascribed not to ultimate purposes of God, but to the struggle     for existence, to adaptation by organisms to a changing environment. Futuyama's     underlying view is that of \"material, mechanistic\" explanations for natural     events: he identifies this view as identical with that of \"science.\"          Surely, the propositions of     evolutionary theory are incompatible with creationism. For modern biological     science, there is no question of plan or purpose in nature (although as     Alexandre Koyre shows, Newton was convinced that physical laws corresponded     to God's plan even if teleological explanation had no place in physics). 21      However, many evolutionists and philosophers of biology have come     to insist that Aristotle's idea of final cause, so vehemently rejected     by the early evolutionists, had a place in modern scientific theory. Stephen     J. Gould remarks:           It is still unfashionable in     biological circles to use such words as 'design,' 'purpose,' or     'teleology.' Since final cause is so indispensable a concept in the     elucidation of adaptation, and since natural selection can produce a     well-designed structure without any conscious intervention of God's     superhuman wisdom or the sub-human intelligence of the animal in question,     one would think that these terms would again be admitted into orthodoxy.     Evidently, however, we are still fighting the battle with theologians that     we won in deeds almost a century ago. 22            Futuyama may be one of those     still fighting the battle, but in his zeal to distance evolution from     theology, he succeeds only in making his ideas into the mirror image of     his opponent's. Francois Jacob puts the issue colorfully. Commenting on     the role of sexual reproduction as the \"aim\" for each organism and for the     history of organisms, he concludes, \"For a long time, the biologist     treated teleology as he would a woman he could not do without, but did not     care to be seen with in public. The concept of the programme has made an     honest woman out of teleology.\" 23           Today, the metaphors of program     and system to describe the processes of heredity and organic evolution     have opened a new debate concerning the question of causality in biological     science. The earlier belief that science could dispense with causal explanation     in favor of description was intended to remove from natural science what     Laplace termed the \"hypothesis\" of God's design. What has been termed     \"essentialism\" is not so easily removed. The religious counterattack against modern science may be misplaced, but it resonates          14           with a widespread     feeling among ordinary people that science has become a kind of priesthood     and that scientists, like the old priests, are not always forthcoming     about their own doubts, at least in public. The new attack on modern science,     however, is not mounted simply on the authority of the Bible is the true     word of God: it claims the mantle of science. Controversies within science     that reveal deep fissures within that community on questions such as causality     and truth have, until recently, been conducted behind closed doors. in     biology, the mechanical world picture is challenged; in physics, the image     of nature as pure objective extension, subject to prediction and control,     is questioned by those whose work functions at the level of theory, at     the same time practitioners insist that the old news is still best.          Perhaps the most broad-based     skepticism has arisen in the field of medicine. There are several issues     here: at the most fundamental level is the question of the traditional     medical model of diagnosis and treatment. According to this way of seeing,     the human body is a machine (in the older version) or a computer program     (in the up-to-date model). The parts are relatively autonomous, making     possible a treatment regimen that ignores the relations of the parts to     the whole, except in cases of side effects which can be counteracted.     In the old mold of medical practice, the relation of the person to the     environment and the emotional state to the physical state are irrelevant.     In the first instance, unless severe hunger is observed, nutritional issues     are not factored into diagnostic practice. The context of medical practice     itself -- treating individuals -- does not permit the effects of such     \"external\" phenomena as pollution, work environments, quality of life     based on economic circumstances, end stress related to working or family     life, to become objects of treatment.          Medicine, based on the findings     of molecular biology, adopts a systems approach to both diagnosis and     treatment. In the more ecological mode, the human body is an open-ended     system that is determined by its genetic code,     but may be influenced by the     environment with which it has homeostatic relations. In the less interesting     version, the body is a dosed system consisting of information networks     that are only peripherally subject to external influences. Francis Crick's     version of the basic requirements for life includes the Darwinian idea,     adapted from Thomas Malthus, that the organism must compete for water,     food, and other life-sustaining resources. But, In the final accounting,     its capacity for survival, he argues, is its internally generated information     system which is built up from its molecular structures. 24 Second     is its capacity to mutate In the wake of changing conditions, a capacity               15          that is given internally. Recent medical science has taken its picture     from Crick and his associate James Watson, who together played key roles     in developing molecular biology. The organism itself remains the object     of study, pristine in Its singularity but seen not so much as a series     of parts but as a system of \"organized complexity\" whose driving force     is the molecular structure of the gene. 25 We treat individuals     differently than before. Since \"the problem of life is a problem of organic     chemistry,\" 26 measures taken to repair damaged organs should     seek both diagnosis and treatment in dysfunctions in chemical combinations     that affect the organ's information program. Thus, such diverse pathologies     as psychosis and cancer become subject to chemical treatment. One seeks     the reasons for various emotional illnesses not in the stresses produced     by the life situation but in chemical malfunctions. Similarly, the most     widely used treatment for some cancers is chemotherapy.          Of course, medical applications     of molecular biology are only one of the major changes initiated by this     new discipline. More controversial, and surely more problematic, have     been the new technologies of genetic engineering which present themselves,     in their visionary manifestations, as fulfilling the dream of both nineteenth-century     eugenics and modern medicine to eliminate disuse by altering those traits     that make humans less competitive in a changing physical environment.     According to Jeremy Rifkin, \"we are virtually hurling ourselves into the     age of biotechnology.\" Molecular biology has succeeded in changing the     heredity of the gene, transferring genes from one organism to another     and, perhaps, more powerfully, has synthesized cells through engineering.     Its most recent applications in food technology promise to eliminate the     need for chemical preservatives.     Molecular biology is a science     with a purpose and design: it seeks to transform life by recombining DNA     which it has postulated as the core of life. This aim surely violates a     wide spectrum of religious principles but also raises profound ethical     issues. For, even if altering or remaking life were to be judged a worthy     social purpose, the question is to whom are scientists performing these     tasks to be accountable? This issue is in the process of adjudication by law and the courts in the     United States, and the results are, to some, horrifying. The industrial     state Of mind has dominated these discoveries and in the United States,     this means private ownership and control of the means of production     (splicing) and of the product (altered organisms). Indeed MIT has recently     forged an extensive series of arrangements with some major biotechnology     firms. In return for huge grants for research the university has agreed     that the patents for discoveries will belong to the   16 corporations. Courts have     decided that these arrangements are legal because they have viewed     bioengineering as simply one more industry. In a free society, so the     argument goes, we may sanction a free market in gene splicing just as we     recognize the free market in the production of steel or cars.     Measures to prevent corporations from engaging in commerce violate     their rights under law.          Two major issues are raised     by these developments. The first is whether we can afford to free the     new discoveries associated with bio-technologies from rigorous public     control, assuming we could identify an appropriate regulatory agency.     The second strikes to the heart of the conflict between modern science     and religion, but has also been framed by nonfundamentalists who, nevertheless,     hold to ethical beliefs that are counter to some types of scientific investigation.     Simply stated, the issue is whether modern science has a right to alter     our relationship with nature, sui generis. On the one side, the     fundamentalists argue against any scientific discoveries that may violate     the word of God as they have interpreted it. For those who would reject     such objections on the grounds that they are \"irrational,\" the alternative     does not imply accepting the new biotechnologies. For if the aim of bioengineering     is to transform our relation to nature, especially our own \"nature,\" then     the claim of science to be free of purpose, to be engaged in some anterior     conception of \"pure\" science is most suspect. If modern science does not     imply the intervention of supernatural powers, it nonetheless cannot escape     interrogation of its underlying ethical assumptions, neither with respect     to the content of its propositions, which it calls \"laws\" of nature, nor     with respect to its responsibility for the results of its investigations.          What is at stake here is the     question of entailment. If     molecular biology chooses to link its discoveries in DNA and RNA research     to industrial tasks, are we not justified to ask whether such discoveries     do themselves entail ethically problematic purposes? This becomes especially     relevant at a time when universities, the traditional seats of scientific     research, are making agreements with large corporations and the government,     which provide the bulk of the funds for their work. Under these circumstances,     the claim of free inquiry becomes difficult to sustain.     Yet, it would be a mistake to     declare that science and technology are entirely determined, in their     content as well as their uses, by the hands that feed them. Science is a     complex, multivaried activity. Its relation to what it \"observes\" is never     unmediated: that is, the economic, political, and social environment     in which people \"do\" science and technology intervenes between     cognition and its object. Alexandre Koyre, 17   who vehemently rejects     explanations for scientific discovery that depend on the practical     conditions that may spur it on, substitutes metaphysics and philosophy as     mediations between theory, experiment, and nature. Similarly, Paul     Davies ascribes the continuing popularity of astronomy to the fact     that the study of the heavens is not far from our common and still     passionate desire for transcendence, for the supernatural. At the same     time, he emphasizes the rebelliousness of nature, its \"inherent     uncertainty,\" its \"randomness,\" and the significance of     \"subjectivity\" in the new physics. According to Davies, the \"observer is     beginning to play a rather essential role in the nature of the world,\"     making absurd objectivist concepts of time and space, including those that     impute to nature an inherent order. 27           Indeed, difficulties experienced     by partisans of a picture of nature as a unified field have generated     major debates within physics. It is generally recognized by physicists     themselves that few of its discoveries are exempt from the variability     brought to them by interpretation. The facts do not speak for themselves     and, through this door, marches religion and other metaphysical doctrines     as well as philosophy. In Part Ill, I shall discuss the relation between     philosophies and the social conditions that may give rise to them, challenging     Koyre and others who wish to preserve the internalist account of science     by limiting the context of discovery to purely intellectual influences.     Suffice it to mention here that many who speak of nature as a unified     field tread dangerously close to teleology, and even God, as the ultimate     purpose. David Bohm, a theoretical physicist, asserts the formal unity     of all natural phenomena, defining physical laws as tending toward the     absolute through the study of partial, relative phenomena; most important,     he defends causality in nature as an unlimited principle. That is, for     Bohm, order, not randomness, is inherent in nature, the truth of which     can be grasped by science. Although he has no recourse to the supernatural,     Bohm insists that there are \"hidden variables\" in quantum mechanics that     belie the picture of randomness and indeterminacy put forward by such     thinkers as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. 28      In short, the struggle between     mechanistic science and religion reappears in different form within     science itself. As I have shown, teleology is almost respectable in     biology, and one of the great debates initiated by Einstein     (unwittingly) and Heisenberg (with some hesitation) is whether God plays     dice with the universe. Some of the key interpretative struggles     within physics are whether we may posit real time and space, and whether     the intervention of \"subjectivity\" removes these categories from the realm     of objectivity. More broadly, the question remains: what do we know when     we know something? If our knowl- 18   edge is ineluctably bound up     with the processes of observation and experiment, and if these are     permeated with a priori assumptions about the character of the observed or     the uses to which knowledge is destined to be put, in what sense can we     say that science as a type of knowledge is superior to metaphysics,     including religion?     Social ecology and radical     feminism, two social movements of considerable political and     ideological weight in many advanced industrial societies have, from an     ethical standpoint, challenged the content and results of contemporary     science and technology. Both have their roots in the 1960s and early 1970s     when a general skepticism about the autonomy of science was invoked     because of the subordination of much of the scientific community to     military requirements, and the propping of scientific research and     technological innovation by industry. Yet, the content of their critique     differs from the assertion that the problem of science and technology     consists essentially in the uses to which discovery and innovation     are put. Instead, social ecology and radical feminism have mounted a     fundamental critique of the scientific worldview, especially the     contention that science and technology are neutral instruments that can be     separated from the context in which they are developed. Social ecology     argues that science and technology, by virtue of their subordination to     the interest of the domination of nature, share responsibility with the     state and capitalist corporations for the \"death of nature,\" a metaphor     that describes the increasing danger to life wrought by scientifically     based technology. Rather than blame the growing problem of environmental     pollution merely on the lack of state regulation, ecologists argue that     technologies of boundless domination are leading to ecological     disaster. On the one hand, the idea of nature as pure \"object\" has been a     normal presupposition of practical physics insofar as it has enabled     nature to be defined by categories of pure extension in the service of     prediction and control. On the other hand, the imperiousness of molecular     biology consists in its eugenic ideology, its eagerness to play God by     altering the distinctive characteristics of our species. Ecologists     explain the rebelliousness of nature as a reaction to human interventions     that disturb its internal relations and its homeostatic relations with     various species of life. The consequences of the industrial logic that     marks contemporary biology can be dangerous to life. But the explanation     given by social ecology for this state of affairs transcends the purview     of social policy. What enables science to engage in life endangering     activities is a belief that humans may insure their future by subjecting     the gene to engineering, just as earlier industrialists exploited     nonrenewable raw materials to advance various ends, including profits and     the promise of liberation   19 from material hardship and other socially     approved values. Here we are engaged in a drama of both intention and     unintentional consequences. The ideology of nature as \"other\" or     \"matter\" undifferentiated by quality and infinitely fungible is a     necessary condition for a science that has integrated itself into     technology, in which the difference between them becomes analytic rather     than ontological. Theoretical physics and biology may try to hold     themselves aloof from the uses to which their discoveries may be put;     Einstein certainly did not mean to lend his discoveries to the invention     of weapons of nuclear destruction, and seventeenth-century     astronomers may not have performed their work exclusively for the sake of     improving instruments of navigation. Nor is it necessary to make     direct connections between developments in wave mechanics and the     rise of communications technology. The arguments made by those who try to     discover, both by empirical research and by inference, a commercial or     industrial telos in processes of discovery are certainly misdirected.     The point is, rather, to examine the tendency of scientific ideology, the     stuff of which discovery is made, that is, to situate science as a     discourse within a larger system of social relations in which economic and     political influences do not necessarily appear directly in the     laboratory.          Ecology takes two directions     on this issue. One is to argue from what might be called a historical     standpoint: this is no longer the age of the individual thinker puttering     in the laboratory under conditions similar to those of the artist. While     scientific procedures may be considered quite distinct from those of the     artist (except perhaps the composer of music), the creative side of science     was, at the time of Galileo and even Lavoisier, commensurable with that     of art. Scientific and artistic work requires months, perhaps years, of     drudgery. But the process of scientific discovery in the seventeenth and     eighteenth centuries, and even well into the nineteenth, was marked by     individual effort. The scientist, like the artist, worked alone or with     very small groups. Then comes Pasteur, in the later years of the century,     a professor who, as Bruno Latour reports, attaches himself to forces of     industry and the state and makes science a social force. 29 Latour's     narrative of Pasteur's claim that he had made a serum that cured an anthrax     epidemic in France was not validated through reproducible experiments     made by scientists but by three institutions possessing the power to certify     such a claim: the scientific community, of course; milk processors and     producers requiring some relief from a costly and nearly devastating outbreak     of the disease among cattle; and the state. Latour's conclusion is not     that \"society\" influences the course of science, but that the laboratory     becomes a model for social power. Drawing on FoucauIt's thesis          20          that the knowledge/power relation becomes characteristic of modern society,     not only does Latour posit this conjuncture as the condition of scientific     truth, but he conversely argues that traditional institutional power draws     its strength from the laboratory which in the twentieth century becomes     a producer of commodities and of social power. Latour wishes to demonstrate     that science is not subordinate to capital, as Marx and Marxists argue,     but has become a crucial form of capital, with the laboratory a site of     its production. Science retains some of the features of art, but the process     of scientific discovery has been permanently removed from anything resembling     an autonomous sphere.          Science lends itself to integration     because it shares, with the rest of society, the teleology of domination     over nature. Its incorporation into industry and the state may be necessary     for the survival of nations, considering the world economic and political     order. But, as these ecologists contend, such a close relationship between     science and the forces of order means that industry has been able to multiply     its productive powers by geometric proportions over industrial production     in the (relatively) prescientific age. Specifically, the transformation     of physical, chemical, and biological knowledge into instruments of economic,     political, and military power is the foundation of our ecological crisis.          It does not matter that the     scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic/industrial     and military power. The evidence is overwhelming that such is the case.     Thus, every major industrial power has a national science policy; the     United States military appropriates billions each year for \"basic\" as     well as \"applied\" research. The National lnstitutes of Health provide     vast sums for research that will be transformed into industrial technologies     by private corporations which, in turn, make products for industry and     for mass consumption that often spell disaster for the environment. What     distinguishes this indictment from the criticisms of environmentalists     is the demand by ecologists for new social arrangements that embody a     radically new principle in our collective relationship to nature. Their     demand for an ecologically pacific natural environment threatens the organized     complexity of the marriage of science and industry in every country. The     collective nature of scientific research is made possible only by the     investments of the state and large corporations. Better to halt this form     of science and return to science as art. Under such circumstances, a way     of life would come to an end, for scientific and technological development     underlies rising standards of living in the most industrially developed     countries. Beyond the standard of living is a whole concept of culture     based upon consumption, our notions of the relation-          21          ship between work and what we call \"leisure,\" in short, our relationship     to experience. That the \"technological sensorium\" dominates everyday life     seems hardly disputable. 30 The question is whether this is     what we want. Ecology normatively challenges this sensorium rather than     focusing only on its effects. It has formed and inspired movements, political     parties, and massive protests against those who employ scientifically     produced technologies that, in its view, inhibit freedom. What is at stake     in its alternative is the possibility of constructing a social ethic that     proposes different assumptions about what constitutes the good life. For     the philosophy of ecology, a world without domination, domination of nations,     of women, of nature, of cultures, requires a radically different conception     of science and technology since what it entails is a radically new idea     of the everyday.     Ecology's critique of science     and technology, while not ostensibly religious, suggests that ethical     neutrality with respect to the results of scientific enterprise is not     justified. The ecological position, in its most sophisticated formulation,     challenges the idea that any form of human knowledge can be separated from     its consequences. If one finds that science has made an alliance with     prevailing forces of destruction to further the interest of domination of     humans, its position as an unassailable, almost sacrosanct discourse     must be overturned. Murray Bookchin, perhaps America's most trenchant and     global ecological theorist, puts the case:           In our discussions of modern     ecological and social crises, we tend to ignore the more underlying     mentality of domination of each other and by extension of nature. I refer     to an image of the natural world that sees nature as \"blind,\" \"mute,\"     \"cruel,\" \"competitive,\" and \"stingy,\" a seemingly demonic \"realm of     necessity\" that opposes \"man's\" striving for freedom and self-realization.     . . . This all-encompassing image of an intractable nature that must be     tamed by a rational humanity has given us a domineering form of reason,     science and technology. 31            To this image, Bookchin     opposes \"an ecological standpoint: nature as a constellation of     communities . . . freed of all anthropocentric moral trappings, a     participatory realm of interacting life forms whose most outstanding     attributes are fecundity, creativity and directedness marked by     complementarity.\" 32  Bookchin     clearly identifies traditional notions of reason, science, and technology     with the identification of nature with the capitalist marketplace (itself     linked to conventional evolution theory, which, as I have noted, is     adapted by Darwin from 22   Malthusian conceptions of     natural history). In effect, Bookchin counterposes nature in     metaphors derived from art to those of enlightenment science, which     has employed the metaphors of commodity relations. In both cases, we     have recourse to ethical discourses in which telos is present as a     regulative principle. Enlightenment science, which believes itself free of     references to purpose, and aim in its conception of nature, has, as     Bookchin shows, simply portrayed nature in the image of capitalist social     relations. In contrast, reflecting the views of a wide spectrum of     ecological thought, Bookchin frankly admits that ecology pictures nature     as an active, purposive agency, clinging to standard notions of     objectivity when he tries to distance ecological thought from     \"anthropocentric moral trappings.\" This anachronism in Bookchin's     discourse reveals not so much the weakness of ecological ideas as the     strength of science as a hegemonic ideology. For the meaning of \"hegemony\"     consists precisely in its presence within the discourse of opponents     of the dominant ideology. At the same time, it can be argued that the     ecological and feminist critiques of modern science are based on exposing     science as ideology by means of showing its subjectivity, its character as     ambiguous moral agent.     The explosion of the modern     feminist movement since the late l960s has generated what is perhaps the     richest body of social theory in the last twenty years. This is not to     ignore the extraordinary work of Simon de Beauvoir or earlier theorists     of feminism such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 33 or the many feminist     novelists whose critiques of marriage and the family were framed within     conventional literary forms. Feminist theory has sought to explore the     position of women in the West as well as the Third World in a great number     of intellectual fields. Feminist historians have sought to debunk the myth     that there is no \"her\" story in economic, political, and cultural terms.     Since, as Walter Benjamin remarked, history is written by the victors, the     hidden story of women's struggles for equality and escape from the yoke of     male domination has to be told by other women who will explore the     underside of dominant narratives. This history joins the general movement     of social history that has succeeded in uncovering the lives of working     people, black slaves, and other \"invisible\" groups denied a public     identity by those who are the appointed guardians of official history.     Sociologists and anthropologists have explored the lives of women engaged     in homemaking, and have sought to restore to that activity the name     labor.\" 34 Others have theorized the equal social weight of the labor of     biological and social reproduction -- especially child rearing -- with that     of material production, arguing     that women participate as workers in both spheres but have been     systematically 23 expunged from considerations     of questions of social relations and power. In short, the lives of women,     their forms of self-production and self-organization, their successes and     failures, have been the loud silence in historical and social scientific     studies. A whole army of feminist scholars have made enormous efforts     to recover women's voices, to uncover the specificity of women's     discourse.          The attempt to find women's     voice in science, especially in scientific discovery, proceeds according     to at least two major roads of inquiry. First is to assert that women     have participated in science and technology, if not as equals, at least     in considerable depth. The figures of geneticist Barbara McClintock, organizational     and technological theorist Lillian Gilbreth, physical therapist Sister     Elizabeth Kenny, and physicist Marie Curie are invoked only to illustrate     the range of contributions that women have made to scientific and technological     discovery. Citing Erik Erickson's question, \"what will happen to science     if and when women are truly represented in it -- not by a few glorious     exceptions, but in the ranks of the scientific elite?\" Evelyn Fox Keller     is quick to remind us that despite McClintock's contribution to understanding     the mechanism of inheritance, she is still the exception, and that science     is dominated by men. 36 Extensive study of McClintock's difficult     travail as a genuine theorist rather than practitioner of normal science     was meant to illustrate that, as a visionary, she faced resistance from     a scientific elite ensconced in its own assumptions and prejudices against     women, and that the moral neutrality of scientists could not be assumed     despite the possibility that McClintock offered new knowledge. Keller's     interest is to show that sex and gender relations bear on the exclusion     of women from scientific communities and that these relations are deeply     rooted in the ideology of Western culture, inscribed in its most eminent     philosophical works -- that woman is other, is identified with nature,     and is an object of domination. Francis Bacon, one of the formative figures     in the development of modern scientific ideology, was also a key proponent     of the identity of science with male power. Nor was he exceptional. Keller's     reading of Plato's Symposium and     Phaedrus reveals the close relationship of male sexuality and the production     of knowledge. Knowledge for Plato is erotically based, but closed to female     participation 37           While affirming that gender     has become a crucial element in the exclusion of women from science, Keller     rejects the idea advanced by some feminist writers that Western science     is male science. In feminist theory, this concept seeks to remove from     Western science the mantle of objectivity by proving that its antiecological     practices -- and, even more significant, the mathematicization of nature     and the scientific          24          ethic of prediction and control -- are steps toward the exclusion of women     and undermine modern science's universalism claims. Whereas Keller confines     her critique to the exclusion of women from the scientific elite, Carolyn     Merchant contrasts the modern scientific worldview which is formed by     the dual concepts of \"mechanism and the domination of nature\" with an     earlier \"organic-oriented mentality\" that held to a nurturing image of     the earth, an image of which the womb, woman/mother are the central referents. 38      According to Merchant, the replacement of this imagery, which survived     as late as the Renaissance, by the mechanical world picture is linked     to commercialization and industrialization, which remain the animus of     our contemporary social world. These images had been a crucial feature     of Western civilization, functioning as an \"ethical constraint\" on mining     and other activities that destroyed the earth. Thus, Merchant historicizes     modern science and, far from conceiving it as \"progressive,\" argues that     it represents a regression from an earlier science that was prevalent     in ancient civilization. \"Violence\" against the earth is consonant with     violence against women, since earth relates to humans as mother to child.     Man's conquest of nature, then, is analogous to dominating women. For     Merchant, it is impossible to abstract the development of modern science     and technology from this process.     This is an example of one     vision of what has become known as the \"feminist standpoint.\" In the     materialist account, the sexual division of labor in which women have been     made subordinate to men in all aspects of their existence -- material     production, social reproduction, especially in their enforced role of     chief, if not sole, child rearer -- has consequences for the character of     knowledge. Knowledge is gender differentiated, according to Nancy     Hartsock, because the sexual division of labor forces women to occupy a     different position in the social structure. 39 This position is     not induced by the biological differences between men and women but is,     instead, socially constructed. She acknowledges these differences but     argues that we can never know the degree to which they might influence, if     not determine, the forms of knowledge until sexual divisions are     abolished.          This is the \"objectivist\" account     of the feminist standpoint insofar as it does not rely for its argument     on the actual consciousness of women. Rather, following Marx and Georg     Lukacs, the structure of Hartsock's argument reiterates the view that     social being determines social consciousness but substitutes women for     the proletariat. Otherwise, one would have to adopt the viewpoint that     knowledge is free of its material preconditions, that there is an unmediated     relationship          25          between the knower and known. Hartsock's central metaphors are those of     political economy, although she draws liberally on the psychoanalytic     literature of object relations as well. Yet, the ideas of commodification,     appropriation, exploitation, and oppression are the crucial analytic categories     in her attempt to establish a specifically feminist discourse or standpoint.          Hartsock does not spell out     the implications of such a view for the relation of gender and science,     but her account bears on the production of knowledge. Even though Hartsock     distances herself from culturalist versions of feminism such as those     offered by Merchant, Mary Daly, and Susan Griffin -- all of whom represent     the fall of civilization in terms of the transformation from maternal,     or female, images and myths to those of masculinity -- she adopts their     theory of knowledge while framing it within Marxist concepts of historical     materialism. Her criteria for the concept of feminist standpoint is totally     derived from the presuppositions of Marxist theory in its Lukacsian form,     including the idea that the standpoint of the exploited or the oppressed     makes possible the unmasking of prevalent social relations that produce     oppressive conditions of life. That there is a specifically woman's experience     of the world is beyond question. What needs to be interrogated, however,     is whether this experience produces a feminist epistemology. Like Merchant,     Hartsock reads masculine epistemology into the history of Western philosophy.     Hegel's master-slave dialectic, in which the self is formed through a     \"life and death struggle,\" is ascribed by Hartsock to class and masculine     relations, thus denying its universality. Males are afflicted with dualistic     consciousness; they live in, but are not of, the family. Their formative     experiences are of an abstract character \"and a denial of the relevance     of the material world to the attainment of what is of fundamental importance:     love of knowledge, or philosophy (masculinity). The duality of nature     and culture takes the form of a devaluation of work, or necessity, and     then primacy instead of a purely social interaction for the attainment     of undying fame.\" 40 Beginning with a materialist account of     women's position in social reproduction, Hartsock finds common ground     with cultural feminism's attack against science as the realm of the abstract     and the identification of women with nature. But she goes further to link     masculinity to the pursuit of knowledge as an abstract ideal. In this     paradigm, women are concerned with the affective realm, men with the cognitive;     women are consigned to the concrete, men to the abstract. Women are nature,     males culture. Of course, these antinomies are the elements of masculine     ideology. But Hartsock does not stop there. For her critique of the          26          antinomies of sexist thought has a point: it is to construct an image     of women that is represented as the real in contrast to the male imaginary:                Women's construction of     self in relation to others leads in an opposite direction --toward     opposition to dualism of any sort; valuation of concrete, everyday life; a     sense of a variety of connectedness and continuities both with other     persons and with the natural world. If material life structures     consciousness, women's relationally defined existence, bodily experience     of boundary challenges, and activity of transforming both physical objects     and human beings must be expected to result in a world view to which     dichotomies are foreign. 41      In other words, there is a     feminist standpoint which radically transforms the nature of     knowledge. This is so because science derives from its philosophical     presuppositions, which, if we are to follow Hartsock's logic, are rooted     in the conditions of material existence. Hartsock omits discussion of the     concrete knowledge that can be derived from this standpoint and of the     degree to which it would differ from that proposed by the male worldview;     she does not provide a method for arriving at that knowledge. For the     present, we must confine ourselves to the structure of her argument.     Hartsock's critique, unlike those of ecofeminism and cultural feminism,     stands firmly on the twin sciences of psychoanalysis and Marxist theory of     historical change, historical materialism. These are, of course,     derivative of the abstract, universal premises of enlightenment philosophy     of science. For both, the self is constructed out of the manifold     relations into which it enters; it is not a thing, sui generis. Freud and Marx share     the idea that the self is a reified construction masking deeper relations     that are to be uncovered by scientific investigation. In each case,     we are constrained to employ abstract, a priori categories such as the     psychic structure with its three parts (Freud) or the mode of production of     material life with its two elements being forces and relations of     production (Marx). In each case, the domination of nature becomes the     precondition for the formation of self; it is the structuring relation     within which class or psychic relations fight it out. So, if we are     to follow Hartsock, her own theoretical sources are intimately entwined     with masculine forms of knowledge, and the price of appropriating these     modes of knowing must be calculated. Her own description of the categories     of the feminist epistemology are strikingly similar to those produced     by the cultural feminists. Women are concrete; their relation to     nature is continuous rather than dualistic; \"dichotomies are foreign\"     to their way of     27   knowing. These conclusions     also appear in the discourses of Merchant, Daly, and Griffin,     although they make no claim to follow the precepts of male-oriented     science. Instead, they offer an alternative myth to that of science: the     ancient times were a golden age when feminist ways of relating to nature     were dominant. Then, \"commercialism and industrialism\" signaled a fall     from grace or, in Daly's account, patriarchy appeared as a violent     counterrevolution to maternal culture. 42 Merchant's apocryphal,     utopian history becomes a weapon in the feminist struggle against     male science. Premodernity, regarded by the Enlightenment as a static and     reactionary worldview, becomes, for this version of the feminist     standpoint, a science that views the \"cosmos as a living unit\" in which     humans were linked both to the heavens and to other animals. Aristotle,     whose cosmology became the object for refutation by     seventeenth-century science, is here regarded as a flawed but essentially     ecological thinker. Merchant does not render the history of the     transformation of science as a struggle of ideas. As I have noted, she     points to material, economic reasons for the changing assumptions of     science. But since she adopts a frankly utopian and political standpoint,     her account of the \"death of nature\" does not rely on material categories     of causality. Instead, she weaves myth and science together in a     mosaic that takes ideas seriously as historical agents. Hartsock, on the     other hand, manifests the contradiction of a logocentric method with     feminist ideology of organicism.          In a future work, I explore     the substance of feminist and ecological claims about science. For the     present, it is sufficient to open the discussion. Religious, ecological,     and cultural feminist objections to modern science differ in many ways.     What unites them is their condemnation of the failure of science to come     to terms with its own social and political commitment. The virtue of feminist     critiques of science is that they try to go beyond the tendency prevalent     among ecologists, environmentalists, and others, to confine their objections     to the uses without challenging the philosophical presuppositions of science     the content of contemporary scientific theories, or the methods of science.     Merchant has provided a critique, parallel to that of the Frankfurt School,     which focuses on the metaphysical foundations of modern science and suggests,     following the lead of Adrienne Rich that the pejorative metaphor of women     as \"other\" to male reason \"divested of the trappings of patriarchy, gives     rise to a distinctively female bond with nature.\" 43 If the     feminist critique of science as a but not the form of reason     is right, it may occupy no privileged position with respect to knowledge     of nature. It is a way of knowing, burdened with presuppositions permeated     with the interest of (male) domination of women/na-          28          ture. These presuppositions, derived from the social world, configure     its results. Thus, we may subject the scientific method to scrutiny as     well as the overwhelming tendency of some strains of physics and biology     toward reductionism, especially their denial of the concepts of levels     according to which biology, psychology, and social science are discourses     whose object of knowledge is irreducible to physical and chemical properties.     For feminism, the problems of social relations are not subsumed by basic     biological drives, which, in turn, are derived from \"organic chemical     reactions.\" At the same time, the feminist standpoint invokes metaphors     of women's physiology to describe nature.          In sum, the mechanical and reductionist     worldview of natural science is under siege from three major movements     that have questioned the gulf separating scientific knowledge from moral     and ethical considerations. Among the weapons of criticism employed by     these movements, none is more powerful than the readings of the canon     of scientific philosophy since the post-Socratics. The evidence of what     Max Black calls \"models and metaphors\" in the laws of science reveal the     extent to which the categories of myth still pervade science and, particularly,     its inability to eliminate human purpose from the multiple issues surrounding     scientific discovery.     To be sure, science itself has     provided the impetus for much of this work. For, as historians and     philosophers of science have tried to demonstrate, recent profound     changes in the scientific picture of the world have reinserted the subject     into scientific discovery, have revived once hated theories, and have     introduced uncertainty about the question whether science \"needs\" a     teleological hypothesis to explain its discoveries. The reinstatement     of teleology and neo-Lamarckian ideas in biology, uncertainty in physics,     parapsychology and the religious connection to the big bang theory in     cosmology points to scientific communities that are philosophically     and even metaphysically rent. While the public face of science remains     resolutely rationalistic, doubt is creeping in; some scientists have     launched their own movement against corporate and military control over     research, demanding once again a return to the autonomy of scientific     work. And, as was true of physics and biology in the past, the merger of     theoretical science with philosophy has reappeared, even as some     philosophers of science insist that they have nothing to offer the     acquisition of positive knowledge -- their role is merely to clear up     misunderstandings.          Since the relativity and quantum     mechanics debates of the first third of the twentieth century, in which     theoretical physicists openly clashed on questions of interpretation of     the results of discovery, historians,          29          sociologists, and even a few philosophers of science have been given \"permission\"     to interrogate science and to suggest, however meekly, that there are     ideological elements of scientific theory. I shall discuss these developments     in some detail in Part III. For now, it is enough to remark that there     exists widespread skepticism concerning the autonomy of science within     the scientific community itself as well as social movements and a section     of the populations of industrialized countries. Some scientists, philosophers,     and social scientists are exploring the historical and social constitution     of science, especially the \"facts\" that constitute scientific knowledge.     They have concluded, in various ways, that what might be called the \"social     relations\" of science, including the worldviews that are constitutive     of scientific knowledge, are inseparable from the results of discovery.     The philosophy, history, and sociology of science explores the claim of     modern science (a) to be independent of the social/historical context     within which it works and (b) to discover \"facts\" that, even if theory-dependent,     correspond to the external world. The first debate concerns the autonomy     of science from the conditions of the production of knowledge. Since Thomas     Kuhn's suggestion (1962) that paradigm shifts in science were dependent     not only on \"shifts in perceptions,\" a concept borrowed from N. Hanson     (1958), 44 but also upon changes in the context within which     scientific discovery took place, historians and sociologists of science     have tried to get a handle on these presumably \"external\" influences upon     scientific development. Those who wish to preserve the fundamental autonomy     of science, such as Koyre, Hanson, and Kuhn himself, confine these extraideational     influences to the scientific community, defined variously in broader terms,     or, as in some recent sociological histories and studies, to the laboratory. 45      The exceptions (see Paul Forman, 1971) 46 speak of an     episteme, or cultural environment, that may influence the content of scientific     theory. However, only Marxism has provided a social/historical interpretation     that encompasses both science and technology, explaining their development     in relation to large economic, political, and ideological transformations.          Perhaps it was the mechanical     correspondence theory of scientific truth employed by Marxism after Marx     that resulted in the deafening silence with which mainstream philosophers,     historians, and social scientists greeted its accounts. When Marx and     the Marxists are discussed, it is only to dismiss them as in Koyre's summary     refutation cited above. The mainstream tradition in the sociology of science,     represented by Robert Merton and the Columbia school, confines its explorations     of the social context of science to studies of the scientific community,     particularly \"institutional and ethical factors\" such as the          30          character of scientific education, and networks of personal relations     based on schools attended and scientific organizations. 47 Even     the \"new social studies in science,\" -- grouped around the Edinburgh School     (Barry Barnes, David Bloor), Michael Mulkey, Karin Knorr-Cetina, and,     in a somewhat different vein, Steve Woolgar and Bruno Latour -- have,     in the name of abolishing the dichotomy between internalist and externalist     explanations, fashioned a microsociology of knowledge in which the actual     interactions of working scientists, their discourse concerning observations,     and their negotiations as to what they actually \"saw\" constitute scientific     facts. 48 These accounts differ from Mertonian sociology insofar     as the social studies school argues in various ways that scientific facts     are constructed socially, but the scientific community is often made nearly     identical with the social. In this connection, one of the dominant strains     of the social study of science has become ethnomethodology, a derivative     of phenomenology; recent sociology of science seeks to actually locate     the point of production of scientific knowledge as the outcome of intersubjectivity.     In recent times, only the Edinburgh School and Bruno Latour attempt to     link scientific knowledge with social interest, owing much in this respect     to the Marxist and neo-Marxist conceptions of ideology.          Although social studies of science,     including the older work of Merton, do not ignore Marxism, it is also     true that the historical perspective on science and technology that has     been closely identified with the Marxist tradition is marginal to this     work. As I shall show in Part III, historiographic works on science, following     Koyre and Kuhn, remain embedded in the problem of intertextuality, that     is, the relation of scientific ideas to philosophy, or, more broadly,     the prevailing mentality of a historical period. Missing in these accounts     are concrete studies in the social relations of science that go beyond     the laboratory or professional contexts within which scientists act.     In Part 1, I discuss the     theory of scientific discovery emanating from Marx and Engels. As we shall     see, controversies concerning this question within Marxism reveal     differences of interpretation as wide as those in the philosophy of     science and technology. Moreover, as I shall show, Marxism, following     Marx's own ambivalence, mirrors the debates in every discipline concerning     the general question of what constitutes science; the relevance of social     relations to the form and substance of scientific knowledge, that is, to     what counts as knowledge; and, more broadly, the relation of science to     what is called \"society.\"          I follow with an examination     of the Marxist tradition, in its \"orthodox\" version emanating from the     theorists of the Second and          31          Third Internationals as well as from those who may be designated as \"neo-Marxist.\"     My main point in Part II is that the transformations within Marxism tend     to follow changes in mentalities that accompany both social and cultural     developments and the ideologies embedded within them. Like natural science     itself, Marxism is not immune from the controversies of the time(s) within     which it theorizes social and natural phenomena.          At the same time, Marxism is     constantly confronted with a disruption not experienced by other perspectives.     This consists in the problem of reconciling its own claim to be a \"science,\"     in the sense of nineteenth-century physics or chemistry, with its equally     powerful axiomatic proposition that nature and history are constituted     by the social relations of production, and that the production of the     material means of social existence is at the same time the production     of humans themselves (including their mental life). Thus, if social production     is not merely the instrument through which humans survive the vicissitudes     of their external environment but constitutes the multiplicity of their     social relations, Marxism provides the clue to a radically different conception     of scientific knowledge than is contained in its own aspirations. For,     under this axiom, not only science, but Marxism itself, must be comprehended     within the framework of social relations. Both its axiomatic and its theoretical     structures must be understood as aspects of prevailing relations of production.     In this regard, the referent of scientific knowledge, is not only the     object of investigation or, as in recently discovered quantum mechanics,     the observer, but also the social matrix within which modes of thought     are constituted. That most of the leading theorists of science and technology     in the Marxist perspective have been unable to situate their own \"paradigm\"     reflexively, that is, to understand the extent to which Marxist science     contains ideological elements or, at the very least, is dependent upon     the character of those relations that constitute it, attests to the power     of the enlightenment faith that nature (and human nature) may be comprehended     directly. As I shall show in Part 11, on neo-Marxist science and Soviet     science, even when they acknowledge the social constitution of scientific     facts, the historical relativity of scientific knowledge is attenuated     by a strict adherence to a realist epistemology; according to which the     correspondence of Scientific propositions to the material world may be     established through experimental or mathematical proofs. There are, of     course, exceptions, but these have had little lasting influence on Marxism     as an intellectual movement.          One may notice striking commensurabilities     with this development in the non-Marxist historiography, sociology, and     philosophy of sci-          32          ence as well as among scientists themselves, especially those who are     also philosophers. To acknowledge that the production of knowledge is     a social process has not been commonplace in discourses on science; however,     since Kuhn, the idea is becoming more respectable. Yet, of the major movements     of thought originating in the nineteenth century, only Marxism can account     theoretically for this development (the exceptions, poststructuralist     philosophy and historiography and the sociology of knowledge, are in fundamental     respects derivative of Marxism, even if by negation). At the same time,     the countervailing tendency within Marxism toward totality bars a wholehearted     historical relativism.          Nevertheless, whereas Kuhn,     for example, alludes to social     and cultural influences on paradigm shifts in science, Marxism specifies     these in terms of economic, political, and ideological determinants. And,     it is precisely because Marx himself generates categories that make a     social analysis of science and technology possible, that Marxism, despite     its ambivalence, has produced the only coherent social theory of science,     a theory which has scandalized its opponents (for example, Karl Popper).     Only recently, however, have some working in the Marxist tradition been     willing to extend theory to the production of scientific knowledge. Others,     notably the structuralist and analytic schools, have directed their energies     to affirming Marxism 's scientificity by declaring that the social aspects     in its development are of little or no interest, except insofar as they     illuminate the degree to which Marxist propositions conform to canon of     scientific evidence and proof.          In chapters 2 and 3 I examine,     in detail, Marx's theory of science and technology. Except for comments     in letters and his notes for Capital      published as the Grundrisse,      Marx offers no separate theory of science and technology. Rather,     his theory is imbedded, almost coded, in the rich description of the labor     process developed in the first volume of Capital and in the crucial sections     on accumulation. As we shall see, Marx understands science in terms of     the domination of capital over labor. Science is subsumed under capital     in the period of the transformation of the labor process from manufacturing     to modern industrial production. Chapter 4 traces the subtle shift in     Marxist theory of science from its role in production to an epistemological     inquiry closely connected to the status of Marxism itself as a science,     and also considers the role of the productive forces in the transition     from capitalism to socialism, a preponderant concern of leading theorists     of early twentieth-century socialism, who, taking Marx literally, foresaw     that the role of science in the new social order would be even more central     than it had hitherto been in advanced capitalist societies.          33          In chapter 5, I take up the work of the Frankfurt School, which, having     taken seriously Lukacs's insistence that nature was a social category     and science ineluctably entwined with social relations, returns to the     historical focus of Marx himself. But now, the shift away from considerations     of the labor process is definitive. Rather -- like Lukacs, Horkheimer,     and Adorno -- Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel, whose theory of science is deeply     influenced by the Frankfurt critique of science, undertake an examination     of the ideological aspects of scientific assumptions and discoveries.     However, whereas Sohn-Rethel retains Lukacs's focus on the commodity form,     the Frankfurt School presupposes Marx's categories and adopts a Weberian     emphasis on forms of rationality. Chapter 6 shows how later theorists,     particularly Habermas, want to find pathways back to reason but no longer     find them through the route of science. In effect, for Habermas, science     and technology have become part of the taken-for-granted world of instrumental     reason. His is a postindustrial theory of communication that seeks to     address the problems of social relations through language. In Chapter     7 I discuss the full-throated emergence of a Marxist epistemology introduced     by Althusser through the influences of Jacques Lacan and particularly     Gaston Bachelard. I also show the affinity of this tendency with the Italian     school emanating from Galvano Della Volpe. Finally, perhaps the apogee     of this new Marxist scientism is the most recent development of analytic     Marxism, which wants to articulate Marxism with normal, positivistic scientific     method. Chapter 8 explores the history of Soviet ideology of science,     an ideology that has become official state doctrine. I show that Soviet     views of science, while ensconced in orthodox Marxist presuppositions,     parallel tendencies in non-Marxist theories of science as well.          Part III traces parallel developments     in non-Marxist discourses on science. Here, we shall see the battle joined     principally at the epistemological level, since those perspectives that     I loosely group under the tentative rubric of liberalism have no specific      social theory of economic,     political, or scientific discourse. In fact, I argue that a distinction     between Marxism and liberalism at the ideological level lies precisely     in the absence of a distinctive liberal social theory of science. Since     enlightenment ideology, especially its scientific and technological modes,     proceeds from the presuppositions of individually driven market relations,     on the one hand, and claims concerning the universality of reason, on     the other, social theory is occluded from this antinomy. At most, liberalism     appropriates conservative communitarianism as a social site. But indigenous     liberalism implies that society is constituted by individuals and that     individual choice is the foundation          34          of collective association. Thus, the sociological conception of the \"scientific     community\" as the site of scientific discovery and the court of scientific     truth. In turn, the scientific community is composed of associated individuals     united by their training and knowledge, a unity which makes possible the     determination of whether any assertion is scientifically valid.          Clearly, this conception of     the social derives from possessive individualism. There are really no     \"structures\" of social life, no relations that transcend individual determination.     More recently, Michel Foucault has advanced the idea of discursive formation     which links social groups to discourses arranged spatially. Foucault's     insistence on the inextricable link between knowledge and power suggests     that various discursive communities are also political/economic formations     and, more generally, that what counts as knowledge is entwined with domination.     Although Foucault is usually catalogued within post-Marxism, there is     no question that the referent is still historical materialism, even if     the primacy of the economic is denied.          However, there can be no returning     to the letter of historical materialist theories as they were articulated     by Marx and Engels. For as we shall see, both are imbued with the enlightenment     ideal of science as somehow resistant to the infusion of the ideologies     produced in course of the production and reproduction of capitalist social     relations. This view is attributable not only to the context in which     studies of language and discourse as sources of ideology were still in     their infancy, but also to the problems posed by evolutionist ideology.     According to this ideology, humans stand at the pinnacle of the natural     order; their unique stature is owed to their capacity to produce means     of subsistence, and thereby to produce their life. In the production of     all aspects of existence, science is the master discourse and Marxism     underscores itself as the authentic representation of mastery in the social     field, and, as metascience, in the so-called natural field as well.     At issue in this book are both     propositions and evolutionary ideology: I argue that science is a labor     process like others; that its practices constitute an intervention of a     specific kind, whose contrast with types of social and natural     interventions cannot be arranged hierarchically on a scale of truth or     adequacy; and finally that science is a discourse that narrates the world     in a special way."}, {"content": "2005-2006 Courses    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       2005-2006 Courses Quantitative Reasoning Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Natural Science I Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Natural Science II Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Conversations of the West Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 World Cultures Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Societies and the Social Sciences Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Expressive Culture Fall 2005 | Spring 2006            Quantitative Reasoning           Quantitative  Reasoning courses are open to first-year and sophomore students.

It provides an  understanding of visual effects that dramatically enhances our  appreciation of what we see. The study of color, light, and optics has  applications to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology. We  also study the eye as both an optical and an image processing  instrument. Topics include how color is classified and measured  (colorimetry), how light is produced, how atoms and molecules affect  light, how the human retina detects light, and how lenses are used in  cameras.                FALL 2005  V55.0206 Natural Science I: From Plato to Pluto     Prof. Schucking (Physics) syllabus   Begins with the basic phenomena of astronomy: the earth and sky, the  motions of stars, sun, moon, and planets. After this introduction  considers the historical development of astronomy from antiquity to the  17th century. Concludes with the space-age exploration of the solar  system. Laboratory exercises help to familiarize students with basic  astronomical concepts.                FALL 2005  V55.0208 Natural Science I: The Human Body - The Ultimate Machine     Prof. Walker (NYU School of Medicine) syllabus   Highlights the role of mechanical principles in explaining the function  and maintenance of the human body, and the application of biomedical  engineering in devising treatments when body parts or functions fail  mechanically or biologically. From an engineering point of view, the  capabilities of the human body, are truly remarkable. The  musculoskeletal system enables the body to perform myriad movements and  functions. The cardiovascular and pulmonary systems are marvels of  fluid mechanics and transport. The various senses act as inputs to  discern and act on the external environment. The neurological system  provides the control for all activities and functions. From a  structural point of view, the human body develops and maintains itself  by the action of mechanical stimuli on complex biological systems. For  example, stresses and motions caused by body movements lead to cyclic  deformations in the cells within the tissues, producing new tissue and  activating reparative processes; and this concept applies to many other  systems in the body. Eventually some of the structures break down, a  situation for which the field of bioengineering has produced treatments  including artificial parts and organs, augments, transplants, grafts,  tissue engineered parts, and external functional aids. Supporting  topics include design methodology and guidelines on carrying out,  documenting, and presenting research. Guest speakers will present their  specialties in related areas. Student participation and continuing  assessment is emphasized.

Using this  foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new  behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in  sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the  experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the  brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral  disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for  by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter  behavior and brain function.

FALL 2005  V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How it Works     Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus   The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent  molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the  human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems  operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of  blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in  respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign  invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce  various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the  course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying  molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.                FALL 2005  V55.0310 Natural Science II: The Molecules of Life     Prof. Jordan (MAP) syllabus   Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new  pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those  that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of  biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical  to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional  structure that endows them with a specific function. This information  provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new  drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding,  molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure  and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the  varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to  facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular  genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is  stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug  treatments.

This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the  global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially  crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within  the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How  did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is  life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and  the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are  humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future  within the biosphere?

During and since the  European Renaissance, tragedy as usually been explained as a  performance of some universal constraining reality in which humanity is  caught, or of some eternal and ubiquitous limitations by which the  human spirit is wholly bound. It is suggested that such claims have  served to make Western tragedy a \"cultural instrument\" for particular  kinds of aesthetic and political relations to different cultures. Over  the last four decades, African and Caribbean writers in particular have  turned this \"instrument\" \"back,\" writing major works that are political  and aesthetic commentaries on that Western tradition and its  impositions, as well as on their own cultures. Emphasizing this  contemporary transcultural phenomenon, Caribbean and African writings  will be set constantly against European writings, as part of an ongoing  \"conversation.\" Readings: Aeschylus' Oresteia; Job; Sophocles' Oedipus,  Antigone; Aristotle's Poetics; Rotimi's The Gods Are Not to Blame;  Bemba's Noces posthumes de Santigone (English); Nietzsche's Birth of  Tragedy; Walcott's \"What the Twilight Says\"; Euripides' Alcestis,  Bacchae; Sutherland's Edufa; Soyinka's Bacchae of Euripides; Matthew\u2019s  Passion; Shakespeare's King Lear, Othello; Carlin's Not Now, Sweet  Desdemona; Lorca's Blood Wedding; Brecht's Mother Courage; Clark's Song  of a Goat; Aidoo's Anowa; Hussein's Kinjeketile; Sofola's Wedlock of  the Gods; C\u00e9saire's A Season in the Congo.                FALL 2005 V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages          Prof. Tylus (Italian) syllabus   Reluctant Heroes and Cultures in Conflict: In much great literature,  the quest for meaning in a world that threatens to be senseless takes  on the form of an actual physical quest to the realm of the dead, to  the land of one's forefathers, or to the place of one's own death. Such  quests in turn tend to define the genre of epic. We will explore epic  poetry in the ancient world and how it was inflected by what could be  called rival claims: by women writers and characters, by a Platonism  deeply hostile to storytelling, by Christianity and Islam. As we read,  we will talk about the creation of communities within and without the  poems, and thus about literature and its relationship to religious,  social, and other cultural practices. Finally, we will discuss how  cultures and communities revise their\u2014and others'\u2014pasts in order to  create narratives conducive to present needs. How does the Hebrew Bible  revise Canaanite myths? How do the Romans rewrite works of the Greeks,  or Christians writings of the Romans? Works include Mesopotamian hymns  to Inanna; Genesis, Ruth, Mark, Luke; Homer's Iliad; poems of Sappho  and Akhmatova; selections from Plato, Augustine, Vergil's Aeneid, and  Auerbach's Mimesis; early Christian saints' lives; Sufi poetry; Dante's  Inferno; The Name of the Rose (film version).                FALL 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance         Prof. Klein (General Studies) syllabus   Argument, Violence, and Agreement in the Social Thought. Do people  assemble into tribes, city-states, principalities, nations, churches,  etc., out of fear of violence or because of some innate sociable urge?  Do they come to agreement through reason or does their \"reason\" mask  unconscious or unacknowledged capitulation to brute natural forces? Can  thinking about the nature of our reason and discourse lead us beyond  the circle of nature, or is such philosophizing simply more idealistic  covering up of the ugly predicament of humankind? Using a few trenchant  models from contemporary social theory as background, we will examine  some Western thinkers' explorations of these questions, at the same  time asking how a thinker's own civilization (with its own forms of  violence, subjugation, peace, and beauty) shapes his contribution to  the ongoing discussion. In our case this will involve examining the  very idea of \"The Renaissance\" as a rebirth of classical civilization;  and we will ask: Why \"his\" civilization? What was \"she\" doing while he  was writing? Authors: Plato, Thucydides, Epicurus, Aristotle, Tacitus,  Plutarch, Machiavelli, More, Shakespeare, Hobbes.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Manin (Politics) syllabus   An introduction to central themes of modern Western political thought  and their sources in both the Judeo-Christian tradition and ancient  Greece. Topics include: conceptions of human nature, foundations of  human society, the place of law, the notion of covenant, the sources  and nature of political authority, individuals' rights and duties.  Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Romans; Sophocles' Antigone; Thucydides'  Peloponnesian War; Plato's Republic; Aristotle's Politics; Hobbes'  Leviathan; Locke's Second Treatise on Government; Rousseau's Discourse  on the Origins of Inequality.                 FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus   \"Know yourself\" was the phrase inscribed over the entrance to the  temple of Apollo at Delphi. How did the ancient Greeks and Romans come  to know themselves and those around them\u2014as mortal men and women,  civilized or barbarian, slaves to fate or masters of their destinies,  naturally virtuous or vicious\u2014and how did Enlightenment thinkers rework  classical thought about the self? We trace the arguments of historians,  philosophers, poets, and priests in defense of their chosen paths to  self-knowledge: memory, imagination, reason, passion, taste, and  religious devotion. We ask: how do the communities we create (family,  nation, race) affect individual identity? Must we understand the past  to make sense of the present? How do philosophical ideals and literary  inventions relate to practical ideas about the truly well-lived life?  What about the unpredictable effects of love, the irrational, the  unknown, and luck? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Acts, Romans; Euripides'  Bacchae; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Symposium; Thucydides'  Peloponnesian War; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Kant's  \"What is Enlightenment?\", \"Perpetual Peace\", \"Idea for a Universal  History\"; Rousseau's Social Contract; Wollstonecraft's Vindication of  the Rights of Women; Shelley's Frankenstein.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment          Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and  the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have  important implications for society and the individual. They lead to  alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should  exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the  nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the  Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in  mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles'  Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium;  Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus;  Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise;  Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the  English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Goldwyn (French) syllabus   Focuses on voyage, discovery, errantry, and exile in key ancient and  Enlightenment texts and how these stories transformed and shaped  understanding of the world, the \"other,\" and the self. We examine the  way the Enlightenment thinkers revisited, reinterpreted, redefined,  and, at times, rejected their intellectual and cultural legacy.  Readings: Euripides' Medea; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, and Acts;  Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Swift's  Gulliver's Travels; Voltaire's Candide; Diderot's Supplement to the  Voyage of Bougainville; and Graffigny's Letters from a Peruvian Woman.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Starr (English) syllabus   Important and dynamic moments in the history of the Western engagement  with concepts of the imagination. What roles does the imagination play  in religion, philosophy, and literature? What does it mean to \"imagine\"  for the writers of Hebrew scripture, for Plato, or for Descartes, Hume,  or Jane Austen? What are the limits of imagination, and what do those  limits tell us? How does imagining relate to thinking, desiring, and  knowing? Readings: Genesis, Job, Revelation; Homer's Odyssey; Plato's  Symposium and Phaedrus; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions;  Descartes' Meditations; Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding;  Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Austen's Northanger Abbey.                 FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century         Prof. Mitsis (Classics) syllabus   We will be reading, not kneeling at the shrine of, a selection of  ancient and more recent texts which, whether one likes it or not, have  set a standard of measurement for those wishing to engage in any  authentic forms of individual thinking or of moral and social  criticism. Since these texts also happen to be inescapably difficult  and complex, this course offers no reassuring thematic overviews,  dumbed-down summaries of historical contexts, or hip nods to  contemporary popular culture. What it offers instead is an opportunity  to become more practiced in the pleasures and pains of aesthetic  experience, in the rational canons of moral and political argument, and  in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude,  that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death,  or perhaps even worse, faced with eternal life. Readings from Homer,  Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Lucretius, Epictetus, Hebrew  and Christian scriptures, Augustine, Mill, Marx, Nietzsche, Tolstoy,  Freud, Proust.

FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century      Prof. Patell (English) syllabus   Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is widely thought to be one of the greatest  masterpieces of American, and indeed Western, literature. This  genre-defying book mixes comic, tragic, and epic modes as it wrestles  with questions about the relationship between free will and fate that  have tantalized humankind from antiquity to the present. By studying  Melville's engagement with his classical and biblical inheritances, we  seek to understand the sources of the cosmopolitan vision from which  his novel springs. If Moby-Dick is \"the Great American Novel,\" then  what does that tell us about the nature of \"America\"? From what kind of  \"America\" does Moby-Dick arise, and how different is that \"America\"  from the one that the novel seeks to promote? In addition to Moby-Dick,  readings include Kriwaczek's In Search of Zarathustra, selections from  the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles' Oedipus, Vergil's  Aeneid, Shakespeare's Hamlet and King Lear, selections from Emerson and  Nietzsche, George Lakoff's Moral Politics.

Selected recitation sections are  reserved for students in the residence hall living-learning community  for the course. Students in the remaining recitations need not live in  the residence hall but are also welcome to take part in the  Explorations co-curricular activities, such as museum outings, walking  tours, and trips to the theater and opera. These events are designed to  extend conversations about the course beyond the classroom into the  city beyond.                FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century          Prof. Calhoun (Sociology) syllabus   A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with  special attention to the nature of the person, faith, ethics, and the  social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people  understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical  context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes  introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1  Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's  Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions;  Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On  Liberty; Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear  and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant  Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and  Punishment.                FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century     Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus   A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the  dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical  progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and  society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the  former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught.  Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and  Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and  Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's  Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.                SPRING 2006 V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages     Prof. K. Fleming (History) syllabus   Aims to familiarize students with the origins and recurrence of central  themes and problems in Western culture, specifically with the so-called  \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenic traditions--the two traditions  underpinning Western cultural development from classical antiquity  on--and the reinterpretation, reception, and, in some instances,  rejection of those traditions during the Middle Ages. Special attention  is given to the textual genres that characterized these two periods.  Texts of antiquity include the Hebrew Bible, Plato's Republic,  Sophoclean tragedies, and Homer's Iliad. Medieval texts include  readings from Chaucer, Boccaccio, Dante, and the Thousand and One  Nights. Provides a historical and social context for the texts under  consideration and an assessment of the ways in which Medieval thinkers  attempted to reconcile their own unique historical circumstances with  the legacy of the classical Judeo-Christian and Hellenic traditions.  Consideration is also given to the questions: What do we mean when we  refer to \"the West\"? Why are the \"Middle Ages\" called the \"Middle\" ages?                 SPRING 2006 V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages     Prof. Momma (English) syllabus   Introduces students to major texts from antiquity (including Hebrew and  Christian scriptures, the writings of Plato, Greek tragedy, ancient  epic, and Augustine's Confessions) and compares these with counterparts  in the Middle Ages (such as Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, the  Old English heroic poem Beowulf, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes's Arthurian Romance  Lancelot, Dante's Divine Comedy). Consider how medieval Europe  resembles or differs from the ancient Mediterranean world, and how  these varied cultures constitute the foundation of the West as we know  it. Topics include literature and performance, different genres of  writing, transmission of knowledge, the idea of human, and ethics  manifested in different belief systems.                SPRING 2006 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Gilman (English) syllabus   The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the  \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it  also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece  and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of  crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the  \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at  antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture  between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant  with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's  Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke,  Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the  Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's  Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest.

These are the civilizations where  writing began; and each had a significant impact on Israel, Greece,  Rome, and, eventually, the West. Egypt and Mesopotamia are compared and  contrasted for developments such as urbanism and state formation,  imperialism, religion, warfare, family life, trade and economy,  kingship, the role of men and women, literature, cosmology, and art. We  explore literature in the broadest sense, including documents that  might otherwise simply be classed as historical.                 FALL 2005 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies             Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies.  An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as  operative present or as historical past, that common religious base  called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or  observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature  historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the  society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200  years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978\u201379 Islamic  Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with  American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of  interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some  60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of  power in the government and of access to the political and economic  life of the country.                FALL 2005 V55.0505 World Cultures: Africa      Prof. Beidelman (Anthropology) syllabus   Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and  societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources  sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems  in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues,  the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique  system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on  African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for  translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an  African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among  the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist  interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.                FALL 2005 V55.0507 World Cultures: Japan             Prof. Vincent (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Japanese \"culture\" has been the subject of endless theorizing by  ideologues both inside and outside Japan. As the only non-western  nation seriously to challenge the military and economic hegemony of the  West, Japan has always both demanded and resisted explanation. The  result is a bizarre mess of contradictions: Japan is alternately  depicted as a place where history either stands still in a past steeped  with \"tradition\" or accelerated into a postmodern dystopia. Students  are introduced to the study of culture and modernity through an  examination of Japan's experience over the past two centuries. Topics  include the conversion of people into populations and of place into  abstract space, the rise of nationalism and colonialism, the invention  of translation, and the rise of the \"individual.\" Readings include  literary and polemical texts that give an understanding both of the  massive changes wrought by the advent of modernity in Japan and how  those changes were understood, narrated, and politicized.                FALL 2005 V55.0509 World Cultures: The Caribbean             Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus   Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history through  race, class, culture, gender, and attending to the diversity of peoples  who live on the islands. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and  mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's  global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history  of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive  transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four  centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable  influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history  of the regions differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial  economic and political structures; anthropological material on family  and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and  ideologies; and ways in which national, ethnic, and racial identities  are expressed today.                 FALL 2005 V55.0509 World Cultures: The Caribbean             Prof. Aching (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus   The Caribbean and Revolutionary Thought: Examines the Caribbean in four  units as a site where radical challenges to and within Western thought  have emerged. Begins with the 16th-century theological problem of how  to explain the existence of the American continent when these lands  were unaccounted for in the Scriptures and the debate in the Spanish  court and universities on whether the \"Indian\" possessed a soul. The  second focus is on the enigmas of freedom during the Haitian Revolution  (1791\u20131804), when slaves defeated Napoleon's army, thereby creating the  world's only successful slave rebellion and the second independent  nation-state in the hemisphere. Third, we consider the Cuban Socialist  Revolution (1959) through an interrogation of the relationship between  man and society that Fidel Castro and Che Guevara advocated. Finally,  we ask whether the Caribbean is currently undergoing a revolution based  on invigorated, neoliberal economics. Here, the focus is on Jamaica and  its long traditions of both participating in and resisting the world  economy. Materials for analysis include political speeches, films, and  song lyrics.                 FALL 2005 V55.0510 World Cultures: Russia between East and West             Prof. Kotsonis (History) syllabus   Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and  issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including  literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements  from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of  competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural  identity.                FALL 2005 V55.0511 World Cultures: Middle Eastern Societies              Prof. Fahmy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   The histories, societies, and cultures of \"the Middle East\"\u2014a  relatively recent name for a very diverse region of western Asia and  northern Africa. Focusing on the period from the heyday of Ottoman  power in Europe and the Middle East in the sixteenth century until the  present, we use a range of materials, including translated texts,  novels and short stories, films and videos, and photographs, to explore  changing forms of individual and collective identity, patterns of  social life, and modes of government. We pay special attention to how  people in the region experienced and grappled with the profound  transformations their societies underwent from the eighteenth century  onward, especially the expansion of European economic, political, and  cultural power; colonial rule; and the rise of new nation-states. We  conclude by discussing the Middle East today and some of the issues its  peoples face.                FALL 2005 V55.0512 World Cultures: China             Prof. Waley-Cohen (History) syllabus   Major themes of Chinese culture and civilization ranging from antiquity  to the early twentieth century. Topics include art and politics,  loyalty and dissent, women and gender, social organization, the  civil/military relationship, unification and fragmentation, foreign  relations, material culture (including food), science, law, belief  systems (Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism), and the role and importance  of history. Readings focus on primary source material in translation,  including classical texts, biographies, memoirs, government documents,  novels, poetry, and other personal and private writings.                FALL 2005 V55.0512 World Cultures: China             Prof. Ben-Dor (History) syllabus   China, Ancient and Imperial: A cultural history of traditional China  from some of the earliest historical records (about 1200 B.C.E.) up  through the late imperial period (about 1800 C.E.). Covers major  historical events, developments, and trends: social, political,  economic, military, philosophical, literary, and cultural. Primary  sources (read in translation) are the main focus. These include some of  the most important writings from the Chinese tradition\u2014bone  inscriptions (used for divination), early Chinese philosophy and  thought, dynastic histories, historical biographies, novels, satires,  poetry, songs, ritual manuals, diaries, scientific treatises,  philological studies, political debates, and erotic literature\u2014as well  as some Chinese television adaptations of historical novels. Takes an  interdisciplinary approach, integrating history with literary studies,  philosophy, sociology, and anthropology, in order to understand these  works in their historical context. Emphasizes the various textual  traditions that emerged in China\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism\u2014and  how knowledge was communicated, transmitted, preserved, and developed  in China and its vicinity (mainly Japan, Korea, and Vietnam).                 FALL 2005 V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel             Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an  ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual  state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel,  when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older  origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of  reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing  projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.                 FALL 2005 V55.0515 World Cultures: Latin America             Prof. Y\u00fadice (American Studies) syllabus   Explores the cultural, social, and political organization of indigenous  people before the period of European colonization. Studies the dynamics  of the colonial encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous  responses to European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development, and  the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow us to hear diverse voices within Latin American  society, including works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves.  Course materials also include novels, short stories, films,  photographs, and music.                FALL 2005 V55.0516 World Cultures: India             Prof. Rajagopal (Culture &amp; Communication) syllabus   By examining representations of the Indian diaspora in the United  States, the United Kingdom, and the Caribbean, we see that a fixed idea  of \"India\" is misleading in the effort to understand its changing  manifestations. We investigate the ways in which colonialism reshaped  indigenous society, as well as the currents of religious, cultural, and  political change that developed in the process, leading to Indian  nationalism and its contemporary variations.                SPRING 2006 V55.0500 World Cultures: Nations and Nationalism - Islam, Jews and the West     Prof. Berenson (History) syllabus   Considers problems of nationalism and national identity in the modern  world: what a nation is, how nations came to be, what historical  experiences particular nations have undergone, and what forms of  nationalism their peoples have displayed. In pursuing these objectives,  we examine different theories of nationalism and then look in detail at  four case studies, each representing a different form of nationalism:  1) The rise of Arab nations and nationalism amid the collapse  empire\u2014Ottoman, British, and French (1914-58); the extreme racist  nationalism epitomized by Nazi Germany (1918-45); the nationalism of  the movement for national liberation in Algeria (1954-62); and the  rival religion-tinged nationalisms of Jews and Arabs, Israelis and  Palestinians, since 1917. We conclude with some reflections on the  persistence of nationalism in our globalized world.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies     Prof. Katz (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   One of the most widespread and fastest-growing religious traditions in  the contemporary world, Islam attracts a disproportionate share of  media attention, much of it negative and distorted. Through readings of  primary texts in translation, we examine and problematize prevalent  images of Islam and engage with various facets of the tradition. Often  perceived as monolithic, Islamic discourse provides a range of symbols,  concepts, and practices that have been appropriated and re-interpreted  in many ways in different historical and cultural contexts. We survey  many of the most influential trends in Islamic thought and practice  (including Islamic law, ritual, and mysticism) and trace the ways in  which they have been redefined and transformed in changing  circumstances.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies     Prof. Gilsenan (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   One of the most widespread and fastest-growing religious traditions in  the contemporary world, Islam attracts a disproportionate share of  media attention, much of it negative and distorted. Through readings of  primary texts in translation, we examine and problematize prevalent  images of Islam and engage with various facets of the tradition.

SPRING 2006 V55.0505 World Cultures: Africa      Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature) syllabus   Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and  societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources  sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems  in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues,  the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique  system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on  African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for  translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an  African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among  the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist  interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.                SPRING 2006 V55.0506 World Cultures: The Chinese and Japanese Traditions     Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Essential aspects of Asian culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and  Shintoism\u2014studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy  and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese  works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities  and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures  of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese  legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China,  show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.                SPRING 2006 V55.0510 World Cultures: Russia Between East and West     Prof. Borenstein (Russian &amp; Slavic Studies) syllabus   What is Russia? What does it mean to be \"Russian\"? These questions have  troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such  soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special  historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own  identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be  more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West),  or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own  unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout  Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major  characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very  beginnings to the present day.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0512 World Cultures: China     Prof. Guthrie (Sociology) syllabus   The most populous nation on earth, China plays a crucial role in the  world economy. An understanding of China's place in the world must  begin with its modern history\u2014from the Qing Dynasty and the Western  encroachment to the recent economic reforms of the People's Republic.  Structured not as a historical chronology, but as a sampling of  approaches to Chinese society from various analytical perspectives, in  the first half we consider some of the major events, issues, and themes  that have shaped modern Chinese society, focusing on the period from  the Opium War to the present. Through various social-scientific lenses,  we examine issues of war, political upheaval and crisis, social  movements, and the structure of communist society. In the second half  we focus on modern-day Chinese society, examining the current state of  the economic reforms, human rights, and prospects for democratization.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0515 World Cultures: Latin America     Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus   Explores the wonderful, magical, sometimes nightmarish world of Latin  America through the past and present doings of its persons, and their  representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature.  Aims both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness in the historical  confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those  roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from  the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and  Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the  Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of  death in the Day of the Dead, and \"Indian\" saints whose processions are  associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national  integration. At base, the course seeks to answer more fundamental  questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or  Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities  called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and  sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of  the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of  so-called globalization?                SPRING 2006 V55.0516 World Cultures: India     Prof. Goswami (History) syllabus   Introduces students to the society, culture, and economy of modern  India, from the foundation of British colonial rule in the late 18th  century to the nationalist struggle in the early 20th century, through  the lens of broader issues in historical and cultural inquiry. Examines  shifts in society and culture during the modern period from different  perspectives: British colonial agents, religious groups, the middle and  educated classes, women and peasants, and the many-faceted struggle for  independence before and during the period of Gandhi. Secondary sources  are read in conjunction with primary sources (political treatises,  novels, and film) that speak to the more general issues at hand:  colonial domination, the relationship between cultural and economic  shifts, political identities and nationalism, and collective memory and  violence.                SPRING 2006 V55.0529 World Cultures: Contemporary Latino Cultures     Prof. Mu\u00f1oz (Performance Studies) syllabus   Examines the growth and development of Latino as a distinct category of  identity out of the highly diverse populations of Latin American  background in the U.S., paying particular attention to the social  processes shaping its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the  processes of cultural creation behind the rising growth of  transnational cultures and identities worldwide, and of the forces that  are fueling their development. We start by exploring the immigration of  Latin American peoples to U.S. cities, turn to three case studies of  emerging Latino communities, and end by examining contemporary issues  involving Latinos in urban centers, such as New York.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0536 World Cultures: Indigenous Australia     Prof. Myers (Anthropology) syllabus   The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of  interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations  of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered  into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or  positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in  feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in  New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with  their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal  people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in  their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy  and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical  range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through  ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media,  and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and  constructed.                SPRING 2006 V55.0537 World Cultures: Modern Israel      Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and  population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To  understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the  different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150  years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population  (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special  role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew  speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the  peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday  life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on  whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens.  Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are  touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the  impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.           top of page      Societies and the Social Sciences             FALL 2005 V55.0631 Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Metropolitan Studies             Prof. N.

Major topics include:  urban and regional planning, urban politics and governance,  suburbanization and regional development, gentrification and urban  social movements, the gendering and radicalization of urban space,  racial segregation, and urban design and architecture.                FALL 2005 V55.0660 Societies and the Social Sciences: Linguistic Perspectives      Prof. Costello (Linguistics) syllabus   Examines language from a dual perspective: as part of mankind's  biological endowment and as a social phenomenon. Considers the  structure, universality, and diversity of human language. Introduces  the core areas of grammar: its sound system, the structures of words  and sentences, and meanings. Examines the representation of language in  the brain, first language acquisition, and processing.

How have social scientists conceptualized law? What  social processes shape the formulation of law and its application to  particular cases? What role does law play in the functioning of  society? How is law implicated in social change? What issues arise when  law is used in efforts to overcome disadvantages associated with class,  race, sex, and sexual orientation?

SPRING 2006 V55.0640 Societies and the Social Sciences: Anthropological Perspectives     Prof. Himpele (Anthropology) syllabus   Anthropology concerns the ways in which people live in society,  especially as mediated through cultural processes. Concerned with  non-Western as well as Western ways of life and the relations between  them, it addresses the problem of difference and similarity within and  between human populations, including the use of difference to establish  or resist power within social formations. Students explore how  anthropologists use data to develop basic premises about the nature of  human societies and the foundations of distinctive regimes of  sociality, and they examine theories of social life in terms of a  commitment to grasping the perspectives, knowledge, and  lived-experience of social actors through the methodology of  ethnographic fieldwork.

Students will learn  how responsible citizens can use social science and they will learn the  key assumptions and viewpoints guiding work in the various social  sciences. The class uses an innovative approach that lets you learn how  to work in groups: You have been hired as a consultant for a candidate  running for president. Working with a team of other consultants, you  have to prepare position papers that recommend ways to resolve public  disputes over divisive social issues. You have to research each issue's  history, how other countries have responded, what explains which side  people take, which \"facts\" used by advocates are true and which are  false, and what we can predict about the effects of alternative  policies. Your group has to decide how to conduct research and then  integrate your results and ideas into a joint paper. For each of the  four main issues, you will work with a different group of people. Along  with the usual library work, you will do research over the Internet,  and all position papers and commentaries will be exchanged on the class  website. The learning experience is intensive, social, and  self-directed, and challenges you to ground your beliefs and opinions  in realistic findings and theories derived from social research.

Is there a literary language that  works differently from ordinary language? What is literary style and  form? What is the position of the writer or artist in relation to  society, and what is the function of the reader? Is literature a mirror  of the world that it describes, an attempt to influence a reader's  ideas or opinions, an expression of the identity of the writer, or none  of these?

We begin by  considering the power and taboo of images and the ways in which  individuals and institutions that constitute \"the art world\" classify  some of these images as works of art, turn to explore the visual and  conceptual challenges presented by major works of sculpture,  architecture, and painting, and conclude with a selection of problems  raised by art today. Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate  and question the artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and  times.                 FALL 2005 V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images\u2014Architecture in New York Field Study             Prof. Broderick (Fine Arts) syllabus   New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for  firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban  architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts.  Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures  with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both  to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century  architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper  and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.                FALL 2005 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Moreno (Music) syllabus   Contemporary everyday soundscapes are saturated with sound. To some,  there is a sense of dread: music's ubiquity\u2014a sonic cacophony of  sorts\u2014might render it banal and incapable of offering little more than  superficial amusement or serving as a convenient social lubricant. To  others, music's presence confirms its status as a fundamental aspect of  human experience. We explore in a variety of ways how, why, where, and  when we make sense of music: music and/as the everyday, music and/in  the culture industry, music and/as cultural policy; music and/as  technology, music and/as identification (generational, gendered,  racial, sub-cultural, planetary, national, regional, local), music  and/as the body. Our exploration critically examines the notion of  \"expressive culture\" and engages musical forms from wide geo-cultural  spheres and historical moments. We strive to develop creative  strategies for listening through these musical forms and build a basic  vocabulary to communicate our musical impressions.                FALL 2005 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds         Prof. Ochoa-Gautier (Music) syllabus   Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We  encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons;  they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the  movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a  series of specific case studies we investigate the function and  significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic  questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and  evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical  locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural  explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time  and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.                FALL 2005 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film     Prof. Simon (Cinema Studies) syllabus   American narrative films, produced primarily during the period 1965-75,  considered as an innovative cycle of filmmaking in dialogue with  significant historical, political, and cultural transformations in  American society. Examines developments in film genre during this  period especially in relation to political and cultural change.  Narrative innovations are emphasized, with special attention to the  specificity of film form and style (e.g., editing, mise-en-sc\u00e8ne,  sound). Provides an introduction to the methods and principles of film  analysis as well as dealing with this period of filmmaking in depth.  Includes films by Kubrick, Coppola, Altman, and Scorsese.

Meets once a  week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group  excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are  exhibited.                SPRING 2006 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds     Prof. Cusick (Music) syllabus   How do human beings use sound-based cultural behaviors to negotiate,  explore, resist, sustain, or transform our sense of selfhood, identity,  and subjectivity? To explore this question, we focus on some ways that  sound-based \"expressive cultures\"\u2014especially musical ones\u2014have served  as a means for negotiating a range of sexualities and gendered  subjectivities. We examine \"queer\" or \"feminist\" issues in 20th-century  North American music from blues to disco; from queercore to musical  responses to the AIDS epidemic; from \"the problem of women composers\"  to the late-century phenomenon of a distinctively \"queer\" music  scholarship; from the musical practices of contemporary drag kings and  queens to historicized models of cross-dressing in the Western  traditions of opera and musical theatre; and from musicals as  projecting mythic ideals of gender, race, and nation to musicals as a  genre especially appealing to people with non-normative subjectivities.                SPRING 2006 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds     Prof. Roesner (Music) syllabus   The Arts of Music. People have not only developed modes of thought,  systems of belief, and diverse ways to organize themselves collectively  into societies and cultures; in all cultures and traditions they have  also engaged in creative activity of a more specifically aesthetic  nature\u2014they have expressed themselves through art. One of the most  potent modes of artistic expression is through music, a medium  cultivated in one way or another by every human society. We examine and  compare the nature, purposes, and social functions of three different  forms of musical expression\u2014music informed by a Platonic/Pythagorean  aesthetic, Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, and jazz to c.  1950\u2014raising fundamental issues about the nature and interpretation of  music while developing a basic formal, critical, and historical  vocabulary for discussion, and, directly and indirectly, relating this  discussion to an appraisal of the state of the arts today. While  devoting a considerable amount of attention to European art music from  the middle ages to the end of the twentieth century, and to three  repertories that are considered \"classical\" in most respects, we also  draw on the whole range of musics in the world today\u2014classical,  popular, and non-Western musics in all their diversities\u2014and students  are encouraged to introduce the music with which they themselves are  most familiar into the discussion where appropriate.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds     Prof. Stanyek (Music) syllabus   Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music.

SPRING 2006 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film      Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus   As the U.S. moved in the 1940s from a war-time experience to a new,  postwar context, works of popular culture expressed both the hopes and  fears that came with that transition. For example, a series of postwar  films such as the well-known It's a Wonderful Life used magic figures  who descended to earth to help lost and bedraggled protagonists find  their way again in the confusions of the moment. But the way in which  George Bailey's American dream so quickly can become a nightmare  suggests an underside to 1940s optimism. In this respect, film noir, a  trend of films that started during the war but really exploded in the  postwar era, expresses a bleaker, more bitter and downbeat vision of  the historical moment. Here, heroes turn into confused losers or loners  caught in the labyrinths and dead ends of the city. Noir expresses  tensions around urban life, around sexual roles and identity, around  work and success, and so on. We examine noir both thematically and  stylistically to pinpoint its expressive commentary on social trends  and tensions, and attend to the ongoing fascination with--and frequent  revival of--noir style and subject-matter to study how the social  concerns of film noir continue to express complications in the success  story of America as a nation.      top of page              Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "2004-2005 Courses    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       2004-2005 Courses Quantitative Reasoning Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Natural Science I Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Natural Science II Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Conversations of the West Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      World Cultures Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Societies and the Social Sciences Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Expressive Culture Fall 2004 | Spring 2005       Quantitative Reasoning           Quantitative  Reasoning courses are open to first-year and sophomore students.

Einstein's most influential ideas are contained in his  theories of special relativity, which reformulated conceptions of space  and time, and general relativity, which extended these ideas to  gravitation. Both these theories are explored quantitatively, together  with wide-ranging applications of these ideas, from the nuclear energy  which powers the sun to black holes and the big bang theory of the  birth of the universe.

It provides an  understanding of visual effects that dramatically enhances our  appreciation of what we see. The study of color, light, and optics has  applications to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology. We  also study the eye as both an optical and an image processing  instrument. Topics include how color is classified and measured  (colorimetry), how light is produced, how atoms and molecules affect  light, how the human retina detects light, and how lenses are used in  cameras.                FALL 2004  V55.0206 Natural Science I: From Plato to Pluto                        Prof. Schucking (Physics) syllabus   Begins with the basic phenomena of astronomy: the earth and sky, the  motions of stars, sun, moon, and planets. After this introduction  considers the historical development of astronomy from antiquity to the  17th century. Concludes with the space-age exploration of the solar  system. Laboratory exercises help to familiarize students with basic  astronomical concepts.                FALL 2004  V55.0208 Natural Science I: The Human Body - The Ultimate Machine                   Prof. Walker (NYU School of Medicine) syllabus   Highlights the role of mechanical principles in explaining the function  and maintenance of the human body, and the application of biomedical  engineering in devising treatments when body parts or functions fail  mechanically or biologically. From an engineering point of view, the  capabilities of the human body, are truly remarkable. The  musculoskeletal system enables the body to perform myriad movements and  functions. The cardiovascular and pulmonary systems are marvels of  fluid mechanics and transport. The various senses act as inputs to  discern and act on the external environment. The neurological system  provides the control for all activities and functions. From a  structural point of view, the human body develops and maintains itself  by the action of mechanical stimuli on complex biological systems. For  example, stresses and motions caused by body movements lead to cyclic  deformations in the cells within the tissues, producing new tissue and  activating reparative processes; and this concept applies to many other  systems in the body. Eventually some of the structures break down, a  situation for which the field of bioengineering has produced treatments  including artificial parts and organs, augments, transplants, grafts,  tissue engineered parts, and external functional aids. Supporting  topics include design methodology and guidelines on carrying out,  documenting, and presenting research. Guest speakers will present their  specialties in related areas. Student participation and continuing  assessment is emphasized.

SPRING 2005 V55.0207 Natural Science I: Systems of the Human Body          Prof. Brandt (Physics) syllabus   Develops the physics necessary to understanding the various  interrelated systems operating within the human body. The  skeletal-muscle system converts muscle contraction into human motion  (the science of biomechanics is relevant here). The cardiovascular  system transports blood throughout the body, carrying oxygen to the  site of muscle contractions and removing carbon dioxide and heat (fluid  dynamics). The consumed oxygen is converted into work and heat, and the  rate of oxygen consumption varies with speed in walking, running, etc.  (thermodynamics). The nervous system transports electrical signals from  the sensory perceptors to the brain and from there to the muscles;  these signals determine human reaction time, coordination, and optimal  strategies for human performance (electrodynamics and optimal control  theory).

FALL 2004 V55.0303 Natural Science II: Human Genetics                   Prof. Small (Biology) syllabus   We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the  ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain  unprecedented insights into the role of heredity. Beginning with an  overview of the principles of inheritance, such as cell division and  Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern  human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new  discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how  genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene  function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science  and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as  genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and  the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse  methods that scientists employ to study heredity.

Using this  foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new  behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in  sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the  experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the  brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral  disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for  by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter  behavior and brain function.           Note : Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.                FALL 2004  V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How it Works                   Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus   The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent  molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the  human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems  operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of  blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in  respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign  invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce  various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the  course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying  molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.

We examine the chemistry and biology of  biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical  to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional  structure that endows them with a specific function. This information  provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new  drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding,  molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure  and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the  varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to  facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular  genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is  stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug  treatments.

This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the  global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially  crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within  the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How  did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is  life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and  the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are  humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future  within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an  exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.

This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of  different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary  relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial  Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the  use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric  humans, solving a 2,000-year-old murder mystery, the importance of  studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the  4-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.

At the same time, major innovations in  the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical  environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship  between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on  the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context  for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming,  tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.           top of page      Conversations of the West                 FALL 2004 V55.0400 Conversations of the West: Topics in Antiquity and Modernity - Science, Literature, and the Imagination               Prof. Freccero (Italian) syllabus   In modernity, the development of scientific investigation has  accustomed us to thinking of literature and science as widely divergent  activities, despite instances in which they may be said to have arisen  from common sources in the imagination of the West. While scientific  activity is commonly defined in terms of experimentation and  mathematical analysis, there is a creative dimension of science which  is logically prior to these institutional activities. We are thus not  concerned with the \"influence\" of science on literature, or vice-versa,  but rather with examining the imaginative themes which writers and  scientists have in common in three revolutionary moments in the history  of the West. The first is the Copernican revolution in the early  sixteenth century, the second is what has been called the  \"Machiavellian moment,\" at about the same time. The last, one that is  still with us, is the Darwinian revolution of the nineteenth century.  Like all revolutions, however, these had their antecedents and their  posterity, extending back to antiquity and forward to our own time.  Readings: Genesis, Lucretius' On the Nature of Things, Augustine's  Confessions, Dante's Inferno and Paradiso, Italo Svevo's Confessions of  Zeno, Galileo's Starry Messenger, Darwin's Origin of Species, George  Eliot's Middlemarch, Machiavelli's Prince, Shakespeare's Richard III,  Nicholas of Cusa's Learned Ignorance, Pico's Dignity of Man, Pope's  Essay on Man, Giordano Bruno's Ash Wednesday Supper, Gramsci's The  Modern Prince, selections from Plato, Ovid, John Donne.                FALL 2004  V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages               Prof. Ivry (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   God and/or Nature: Canonical and foundational texts in the Western  tradition that explain the world in religious and/or naturalistic  terms. The readings show that both perspectives are employed in most  works, a dialectical interplay ensuing between and within different  authors. Themes to be discussed include myths of origin and divinity,  happiness and the nature of the good, and eschatological visions.  Readings include selections from Hebrew and Christian scriptures and  the Quran, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Avicenna,  Maimonides, and Dante.                FALL 2004  V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages               Prof. Momma (English) syllabus   How has the world been presented and how have men and women who occupy  that space defined themselves through their relation to higher beings,  beasts, monsters, and, also, each other? Students will be encouraged to  discuss how modern concepts of humankind owe to, or depart from,  premodern learning and imaginations. Readings from Hebrew and Christian  scriptures, Plato, Greek tragedy, ancient epic, Beowulf, Laxdaela Saga,  Cervantes' Don Quixote; selections from the Arthurian poems by Chr\u00e9tien  de Troyes, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dante's Divine Comedy.                FALL 2004  V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance               Prof. Javitch (Comparative Literature) syllabus   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1 Corinthians; Homer's Odyssey;  Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; selections from  Ovid's Metamorphoses; Augustine's Confessions; Erasmus's Praise of  Folly; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince;  Montaigne's \"Apology for Raymond Sebond\"; Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part  I . After reading these works with care, and considering them in their  particular historical contexts, as we move from Greece to Rome, from  Hebrew and pagan culture to Christianity, and then to Renaissance  Europe, we will examine how these works imitate, modify, or challenge  their predecessors (e.g., the Aeneid and the Odyssey, the Confessions  and Greco-Roman ethics, Praise of Folly and 1 Corinthians; the Book of  the Courtier and the Symposium), and, also, how Renaissance authors  appropriate the thought and writings of antiquity to forge their own  modern views of the world.                FALL 2004  V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance               Prof. Low (English) syllabus   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Homer's Odyssey;  Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's  Apology and Symposium; Pico's Dignity of Man; Castiglione's Book of the  Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Milton's Paradise Lost. To understand  each of these works in its own terms, we set them against the history  and culture of their times. As we proceed, we find that the  civilizations of Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem contribute to a dialogue,  in which certain important themes appear and reappear, change, develop,  and sometimes reverse themselves. Over the millennia these  representative works have powerfully influenced their successors and  constitute a self-renewing tradition.

How did the ancient Greeks and Romans come  to know themselves and those around them\u2014as mortal men and women,  civilized or barbarian, slaves to fate or masters of their destinies,  naturally virtuous or vicious\u2014and how did Enlightenment thinkers rework  classical thought about the self? We trace the arguments of historians,  philosophers, poets, and priests in defense of their chosen paths to  self-knowledge: memory, imagination, reason, passion, taste, and  religious devotion. We ask: how do the communities we create (family,  nation, race) affect individual identity? Must we understand the past  to make sense of the present? How do philosophical ideals and literary  inventions relate to practical ideas about the truly well-lived life?  What about the unpredictable effects of love, the irrational, the  unknown, and luck? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Acts, Romans; Euripides'  Bacchae; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Symposium; Thucydides'  Peloponnesian War; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Kant's  \"What is Enlightenment?\", \"Perpetual Peace\", \"Idea for a Universal  History\"; Rousseau's Social Contract; Wollstonecraft's Vindication of  the Rights of Women; Shelley's Frankenstein.

The works we study continue to shape the way people  understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical  context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes  introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1  Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's  Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions;  Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On  Liberty; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and  Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic  and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.

Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and  Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and  Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's  Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in  Venice.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Gilman (English) syllabus   The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the  \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it  also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece  and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of  crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the  \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at  antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture  between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant  with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's  Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke,  Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the  Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's  Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest.                SPRING 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Klein (General Studies) syllabus   Argument, Violence, and Agreement in the Social Thought. Do people  assemble into tribes, city-states, principalities, nations, churches,  etc., out of fear of violence or because of some innate sociable urge?  Do they come to agreement through reason or does their \"reason\" mask  unconscious or unacknowledged capitulation to brute natural forces? Can  thinking about the nature of our reason and discourse lead us beyond  the circle of nature, or is such philosophizing simply more idealistic  covering up of the ugly predicament of humankind? Using a few trenchant  models from contemporary social theory as background, we will examine  some Western thinkers' explorations of these questions, at the same  time asking how a thinker's own civilization (with its own forms of  violence, subjugation, peace, and beauty) shapes his contribution to  the ongoing discussion. In our case this will involve examining the  very idea of \"The Renaissance\" as a rebirth of classical civilization;  and we will ask: Why \"his\" civilization? What was \"she\" doing while he  was writing? Authors: Plato, Thucydides, Epicurus, Aristotle, Tacitus,  Plutarch, Machiavelli, More, Shakespeare, Hobbes.                SPRING 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment      Prof. Goldwyn (French) syllabus   Focuses on voyage, discovery, errantry, and exile in key ancient and  Enlightenment texts and how these stories transformed and shaped  understanding of the world, the \"other,\" and the self. We examine the  way the Enlightenment thinkers revisited, reinterpreted, redefined,  and, at times, rejected their intellectual and cultural legacy.  Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, and Acts; Euripides' Medea;  Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Swift's  Gulliver's Travels; Voltaire's Candide; Diderot's Supplement to the  Voyage of Bougainville; and Graffigny's Letters from a Peruvian Woman.

What does it mean to \"imagine\"  for the writers of Hebrew scripture, for Plato, or for Descartes, Hume,  or Jane Austen? What are the limits of imagination, and what do those  limits tell us? How does imagining relate to thinking, desiring, and  knowing?

Since these texts also happen to be inescapably difficult  and complex, this course offers no reassuring thematic overviews,  dumbed-down summaries of historical contexts, or hip nods to  contemporary popular culture. What it offers instead is an opportunity  to become more practiced in the pleasures and pains of aesthetic  experience, in the rational canons of moral and political argument, and  in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude,  that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death,  orperhaps even worse, faced with eternal life.

An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as  operative present or as historical past, that common religious base  called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or  observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature  historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the  society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200  years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978-79 Islamic  Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with  American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of  interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some  60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of  power in the government and of access to the political and economic  life of the country.

Topics include: problems  in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues,  the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique  system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on  African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for  translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an  African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among  the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist  interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.                FALL 2004  V55.0507 World Cultures: Japan      Prof. Yoshimoto (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Examines Japanese society since the end of World War II through a study  of popular culture. Topics include: war and its aftermath, nuclear  apocalypse, the Cold War and economic recovery, consumer culture,  gender and sexuality, technology and utopianism/dystopianism, and  nostalgia for the past. The primary texts to be looked at are Japanese  animation or so-called anime. Writings on popular culture, books and  essays on history, novels and short stories, and other audio-visual  materials are used to develop critical skills in cultural analysis and  to reflect on what is or is not lost in translation of Japanese  animation.                FALL 2004  V55.0512 World Cultures: China      Prof. Guthrie (Sociology) syllabus   The most populous nation on earth, China plays a crucial role in the  world economy. An understanding of China's place in the world must  begin with its modern history\u2014from the Qing Dynasty and the Western  encroachment to the recent economic reforms of the People's Republic.  Structured not as a historical chronology, but as a sampling of  approaches to Chinese society from various analytical perspectives, the  course considers some of the major events, issues, and themes that have  shaped modern Chinese society, focusing on the period from the Opium  War to the present. Through various social-scientific lenses, we  examine issues of war, political upheaval and crisis, social movements,  the structure of communist society, and economic reform.                FALL 2004  V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel      Prof. Kawashima (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   Examines various aspects of the \"culture\" of ancient Israel from its  origins up to the Babylonian Exile (587 B.C.E.) through a close reading  and analysis of large portions of the Hebrew Bible. Focuses in  particular on Israelite religion, not just as a set of beliefs and  practices, but as a way of understanding gods, humans, the world, and  the relations among them. Topics include: myth, ritual, sacrifice, law,  and the sacred. Our method is comparative, drawing on mythic and epic  traditions of Mesopotamia, Ugarit, and Greece, in order to bring the  peculiar nature of the Hebrew Bible and biblical religion into better  focus. We address the conceptual divide between so-called \"pagan\"  religions and, for lack of a better term, the \"monotheistic\" religion  of ancient Israel. The point is not to judge the relative merits of  these two different religious systems, but to recognize and understand  their differences. Questions of historical background and literary form  (myth, epic, history) will also be taken into account.

Studies the dynamics  of the colonial encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous  responses to European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development, and  the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow us to hear diverse voices within Latin American  society, including works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves.  Course materials also include novels, short stories, films,  photographs, and music.                FALL 2004  V55.0516 World Cultures: India      Prof. Goswami (History) syllabus   Introduces students to the society, culture, and economy of modern  India, from the foundation of British colonial rule in the late 18th  century to the nationalist struggle in the early 20th century, through  the lens of broader issues in historical and cultural inquiry. Examines  shifts in society and culture during the modern period from different  perspectives: British colonial agents, religious groups, the middle and  educated classes, women and peasants, and the many-faceted struggle for  independence before and during the period of Gandhi. Secondary sources  are read in conjunction with primary sources (political treatises,  novels, and film) that speak to the more general issues at hand:  colonial domination, the relationship between cultural and economic  shifts, political identities and nationalism, and collective memory and  violence.                FALL 2004  V55.0523 World Cultures: Islam in Asia      Prof. McChesney (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   More Muslims live today in Central and South Asia than in the entire  Middle East. We consider the spread of the religion of Islam from the  Middle East, the nature of the ensuing dialogue between Muslimsand  adherents of existing religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, shamanism), and  the politics of Islam today in the Central Asian countries of the  former Soviet Union, and in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and  Bangladesh. The focus is on the nature of the dialogue and conflict  between the adherents of Islam and those of other religious traditions,  in order to clarify the economic and social issues behind conflicts  waged in the name of religion. Readings and films will make use of  indigenous materials and their representations of Islam in those  regions both historically and today.                FALL 2004  V55.0534 World Cultures: The Black Atlantic      Prof. Fischer (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus   The cultures of the African diaspora that resulted from the Atlantic  slave trade and the struggle against it, focusing on the political and  expressive cultures of the Black Atlantic, and asking how issues  concerning racial slavery, racial subordination, and racial liberation  affected the formation of national cultures from Enlightenment Europe  to the 20th century Caribbean and the United States. Special attention  will be paid to the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804), the only successful  slave revolution in Western history. Readings in the historiography of  the Atlantic of the slavery and post-slavery period will be  supplemented by readings in political philosophy, anthropology, and  literature, as well as film screenings.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies      Prof. Ben-Dor (History) syllabus   Islamic culture\u2014from Spain to China, and from pre-Islamic times to the  late Ottoman period\u2014viewed through written texts, as well as music,  visual arts, and films. Topics include: poetry, the Quran, hadith,  fiction, travel and adventure literature, philosophy, law, polemical  writing, geography and historiography, science, and love. Each theme,  literary genre, or topic is examined through several examples drawn  from varying contexts and periods. While the approach is not strictly  chronological, particular attention is paid to the historical context  giving rise to the materials under consideration.                SPRING 2005 V55.0511 World Cultures: Middle Eastern Societies      Prof. Fahmy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   The histories, societies, and cultures of \"the Middle East\"\u2014a  relatively recent name for a very diverse region of western Asia and  northern Africa. Focusing on the period from the heyday of Ottoman  power in Europe and the Middle East in the sixteenth century until the  present, we use a range of materials, including translated texts,  novels and short stories, films and videos, and photographs, to explore  changing forms of individual and collective identity, patterns of  social life, and modes of government. We pay special attention to how  people in the region experienced and grappled with the profound  transformations their societies underwent from the eighteenth century  onward, especially the expansion of European economic, political, and  cultural power; colonial rule; and the rise of new nation-states. We  conclude by discussing the Middle East today and some of the issues its  peoples face.                SPRING 2005 V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel      Prof. Schiffman (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times and  the second Temple period and the emergence of classical Judaism,  covering the period from c. 1400 B.C.E. to the third century C.E.  Topics include the achievements of these societies in law and social  organization, prophetic movements, history of Israelite religion and  early Judaism, and ancient Hebrew and Jewish literature. The Hebrew  Bible and Rabbinic literature preserve much of the creativity of  ancient Israel; and archaeological excavations in Israel and  neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in  Hebrew and related languages have added to our knowledge. In addition,  new discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls contribute greatly to our  understanding of the history of Judaism and the emergence of  Christianity. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.                SPRING 2005 V55.0515 World Cultures: Latin America      Prof. Himpele (Anthropology) syllabus   Explores the cultural, social, and political organization of indigenous  people before the period of European colonization.

SPRING 2005 V55.0516 World Cultures: India      Prof. Rajagopal (Culture &amp; Communication) syllabus   By examining representations of the Indian diaspora in the United  States, the United Kingdom, and the Caribbean, we see that a fixed idea  of \"India\" is misleading in the effort to understand its changing  manifestations. We investigate the ways in which colonialism reshaped  indigenous society, as well as the currents of religious, cultural, and  political change that developed in the process, leading to Indian  nationalism and its contemporary variations.

The emphasis is on the Soviet experience, though the Tsarist  past and post-Soviet developments are also considered. Special  attention is given to the role of historical traditions, leadership,  ideology, ramifying events, and socioeconomic factors.

Regions of  special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering  on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of  cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to  non-African influences.                SPRING 2005 V55.0535 World Cultures: Korea and Korean Diaspora      Prof. Park (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Modern Korean history is characterized by a volatile transformation of  the nation: the national division into South and North Koreas and their  ideologically skewed relations with Korean diasporic communities during  the Cold War period, and the economic and cultural integration of the  two Koreas and the Korean diaspora in the post-Cold War era. To  understand the origins and changing processes of Korean politics, our  study embeds Korean nation formation in geopolitics and global  capitalism, in three parts: the politics and cultures of decolonization  and the \"economic miracle\" in South Korea; political ideology and  economic crisis in North Korea; and the study of Korean-Chinese,  Korean-Japanese, and Korean-American diasporic communities, as well as  their relations with both North and South Korea.           top of page      Societies and the Social Sciences                 FALL 2004 V55.0600 Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics - Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Empires and Political Imagination      Prof. Burbank (History) &amp; Prof. Cooper (History) syllabus   Throughout history, most people have lived in empires. How have empires  inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging,  and power? Comparative study of empires from the Romans to the present  expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the  nation-state is \"natural\" and necessary. We explore historians' various  approaches to studying empires and investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese,  Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as  well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other  imperial polities.                FALL 2004  V55.0600 Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics - Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Human Rights and Transitional Societies      Prof. Dixon (Sociology) syllabus   Explores the development of the rule of law and human rights in  transitional societies. Particular emphasis is given to these issues in  post-Nazi Germany and post-communist Central Europe, especially the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and the former East Germany.  After a brief history of Czechoslovakia and the constitutionalization  of the \"velvet revolution,\" we examine the historical, domestic and  international context of human rights in transitional justice. To  understand the historical context, we discuss the debates that occurred  when emerging democracies dealt with former regimes during  de-Nazification and de-communization (public access to the files of the  former secret police, purging and screening, prosecution, statutes of  limitations). We also compare similar debates in transitional regimes  in Central America, South Africa, and Iraq. To study the domestic  contexts, we examine contemporary human rights debates as they relate  to citizenship and nationalism, freedom of the press, social and  economic rights, women's rights, and discrimination against the Roma  (gypsies). Finally, we explore the international context of human  rights by analyzing human rights and European Union membership, the  application of Western legal rights, the globalization of law, and  contradictions between \"local\" and \"global\" human rights.

How have social scientists conceptualized law? What  social processes shape the formulation of law and its application to  particular cases? What role does law play in the functioning of  society? How is law implicated in social change?

Strong  emphasis is given to art forms other than painting and sculpture,  including ceramics, lacquer, metalwork, and textile design, in order to  question the ways in which individuals and institutions classify and  define works of art. Students learn vocabulary to analyze and  appreciate works of art from a variety of perspectives, including  style, technology, and literary or historical context. Coincident with  a major exhibition of Chinese art at the Metropolitan Museum, \"China:  Dawn of a Golden Age,\" students explore and write about actual works on  display in New York City.

Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures  with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both  to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century  architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper  and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.                FALL 2004  V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Boorman (Music) syllabus   Music as Sound, Music as Communication. How does music works, what are  its elements, and how do they help it act as a communicative device? To  explore the various ways in which music has been used to communicate  different types of messages, we consider case studies of classical  music of the 18th and 19th centuries, music in Indonesia, music as a  vehicle for political messages, and new ideas about music itself.                FALL 2004  V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Cusick (Music)      Prof. Dujunco (Music) syllabus   Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We  encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons;  they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the  movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a  series of specific case studies we investigate the function and  significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic  questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and  evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical  locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural  explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time  and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.                FALL 2004  V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film      Prof. Allen (Cinema Studies) syllabus   Using the films of Alfred Hitchcock, we explore the representational  and expressive possibilities that cinema affords in the context of mass  culture, at the same time providing students with the concepts to grasp  the different ways in which films create meaning, achieve their  emotional impact, and respond in complex ways to the historical  contexts in which they are made. Hitchcock made 53 feature films in a  fifty-year career. Seeking recognition of the role of the film director  as the distinctive creative influence in the medium, he grafted  modernist strategies of visual symbolism and metaphor onto the  essentially conservative, masculine, patriotic and popular genre of the  espionage thriller. In this way he probed the idea of the formation of  the couple\u2014the sine qua non of popular narrative\u2014by connecting the  establishment of romance and social order to the problem of deciphering  the visual field and discovering truth in a world of mere appearances,  introducing a remarkable self-consciousness, as well as stylistic  sophistication, into works of mass culture.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0720 Expressive Culture: Images      Prof. Rice (Fine Arts) syllabus   What is the place of art in an image-saturated world? We begin by  considering the power and taboo of images and the ways in which  individuals and institutions that constitute \"the art world\" classify  some of these images as works of art, turn to explore the visual and  conceptual challenges presented by major works of sculpture,  architecture, and painting, and conclude with a selection of problems  raised by art today. Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate  and question the artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and  times.                SPRING 2005 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study      Prof. Broderick (Fine Arts) syllabus   New York's public art collections contain important examples of  painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as  some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art.

SPRING 2005 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Roesner (Music) syllabus   The Arts of Music. People have not only developed modes of thought,  systems of belief, and diverse ways to organize themselves collectively  into societies and cultures; in all cultures and traditions they have  also engaged in creative activity of a more specifically aesthetic  nature\u2014they have expressed themselves through art. One of the most  potent modes of artistic expression is through music, a medium  cultivated in one way or another by every human society. We examine and  compare the nature, purposes, and social functions of three different  forms of musical expression\u2014music informed by a Platonic/Pythagorean  aesthetic, Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, and jazz to c.  1950\u2014raising fundamental issues about the nature and interpretation of  music while developing a basic formal, critical, and historical  vocabulary for discussion, and, directly and indirectly, relating this  discussion to an appraisal of the state of the arts today. While  devoting a considerable amount of attention to European art music from  the middle ages to the end of the twentieth century, and to three  repertories that are considered \"classical\" in most respects, we also  draw on the whole range of musics in the world today\u2014classical,  popular, and non-Western musics in all their diversities\u2014and students  are encouraged to introduce the music with which they themselves are  most familiar into the discussion where appropriate.

We will discuss film and the  media in terms of racial representation and multicultural history. On  the one hand, we will look critically at the stereotyped ways in which  race, ethnicity, and national identity have been portrayed in the mass  media; on the other, we will celebrate alternative, multicultural  representations. The films presented will range from Spike Lee's Do the  Right Thing to Battle of Algiers and Hearts and Minds and Lone Star,  alongside the stand-up comedy of Chris Rock and the media-making of  Michael Moore. We will talk about multicultural issues in France,  Brazil and India as well as the U.S. Some key issues and concepts will  be: contrapuntal history, colonial discourse, ethnicities-in-relation,  third world and minority film, aesthetics of resistance.

Minneapolis            CHAPTER     1 SCIENCE AND       TECHNOLOGY     AS HEGEMONY            When my daughter Nona was two     years old, she frequently exclaimed, after a fall, \"the chair did it,\" or,     as she bumped into the wall, \"the wall did it.\" On September 11, 1986, the     New York stock market plunged eighty-six points. The next day, after a     drop of thirty-four points, a New     York Times story read, \"wide use of computers contributed to slide.\"     According to the writer, trading on the stock market is often detonated by     signals supplied by a computer program. It's a \"split second\"     automatic process; in appearance, at least, large institutional     traders such as pension plans and major banks respond to the slightest     movement of interest rates without significant reflection. On this     particular day, when stock traders came to their offices, \"they were met     by a big jump in interest rates . . . (which) immediately dragged down the     price of futures contracts for stocks.\" 1 This triggered sales     of current stocks by the money managers and widespread purchases of     futures contracts. As the large investors unloaded stocks, others followed     suit and stock prices plummeted. The investors respond to the computer as     my daughter might explain bumping into the wall. Of course, the Times and the analysts they     consulted allowed that national and international economic troubles might     be an underlying influence on the serious fall of stock prices that week,     but from the point of view of investors, it was their computer that seemed     to make the decision to sell.     That we live in a computer age     no one seems to doubt. Yet, along with the paeans of praise heaped upon     this electronic device, there is   4         also a growing chorus of     criticism and a pervasive mood of doubt about its redemptive features.     Actually, the computer is now widely viewed as more than a tool, after     three decades during which many of its proponents attempted to assure us     that, despite its considerable power, it is really an extension of the     human head and hand and has no autonomy. However, in recent years, this     view has been sharply attacked by experimental computer research, on the     one side, and by the practice of those who interact with it, on the other.     There are those like Herbert Simon who impute to it almost mystical     powers, the pinnacle of which is the ability of computers to think     (of course, in order to prove this proposition, Simon was forced to define     humans as \"information processors\"-a more complex conception would     certainly defeat his theory). 2 Artificial intelligence     research seeks to find ways to solve the age-old dilemma of uncertainty in     human action which has plagued the labor process, politics, and vast areas     of social life. Machines that     think are more reliably subject to prediction and     control.     But the computer seems to have     a mind of its own, especially if the controllers are guided by its     information. Many, including some computer scientists, have already     begun to compare computers to the Golem of the medieval ghetto or the     monster created by Dr. Frankenstein. Far from remaining a stunning     but subordinate tool, the computer frequently jumps the track,     subverting human purposes that set it in motion. Like the machines that     characterized the Industrial Revolution, computers are just the     latest occasion for the displacement of fears that \"things\" are out of     control, that their human origin has been lost, and that it is too late     for salvation.     My stock market example is by     no means the heart of the matter. For those who would not speak of     Chernobyl or Three Mile Island should also keep silent about the wonders     of technology. Naturally, those who continue to defend the use of nuclear     technology for supplying power attribute the problems at these sites to     \"human error,\" just as Union Carbide company officials blamed workers and     inadequate supervision for the disaster at Bhopal, India, in December 1984     which killed several thousand people and injured another     200,000. 3 The phrase \"human error\" usually refers to those who     operate equipment; when an airplane crashes, the pilot or maintenance     mechanic is nearly always blamed. Almost never is \"human error\" blamed on     the design of the aircraft or the basic judgment that nuclear energy is a     safe bet. When technology is involved, managers and the media rarely ask     whether the premises of the machine in question are valid. For example,     government officials are prepared to ask whether an adequate     evacuation   5     plan has been devised by a company operating a nuclear reactor;     the technique of generating nuclear energy or producing nuclear weapons is     beyond the competence of regulatory agencies because promoting nuclear     energy is national policy.          There are many reasons why nuclear     power and air travel became privileged technologies in fuel production     and transportation. I do not wish to dispute the economic and political     arguments employed by corporations to persuade the many governments, including     that of the United States, that these technologies were more efficient     than existing means of energy production. For our purposes, the criterion     of efficiency is closely linked to concepts such as cost savings, whose     major component is saving time-time in the extraction of raw materials     from the earth, a labor-intensive activity, or, concomitantly, the time     saved by traveling 650 miles per hour rather than 100 or 200 miles per     hour, the current maximum of rail transportation. Yet, rails have suffered     at the hands of trucks which are, by any conventional standard, more energy-wasteful     than trains. The contradictory arguments made on behalf of various methods     of transport belie pure efficiency criteria: it may be that choices of     technology are made entirely independent of \"rational\" production decisions     but obey a different rationality, the power imperative.     Some students of the     introduction of nuclear energy technology in advanced industrial societies     have raised an entirely different set of arguments why this dangerous,     even disastrous, way of obtaining energy has received such powerful     support. The argument is that the decisions to \"go nuclear\" transcend any     possible rational criteria, measured by economic or technical     considerations. Instead, these critics claim that the basic impetus for     the introduction of nuclear-powered energy is rooted in the hierarchical     structure of society. Those at the pinnacle are able to impose a logic of domination on the rest of     us by simply repeating their falsehoods through every avenue of public     debate and discourse. This explanation removes the discussion of     causality from the domain of instrumental reason. It is not this or     that interest that has triumphed, tragically, in the corridors of power.     Power itself carries its own demand, which exceeds, with impunity, the     boundaries of reason. In effect, power sets new rational codes without     reference to ideology.          If this is true, none of the     by now conventional rational criticisms are adequate to the situation.     One convention is to show that some interests can expect to reap huge     profits from the introduction of certain technologies. Another appeals     to the cult of efficiency as the supreme instrumental arbiter of social     choice. Each of these positions generates          6          a concomitant ideology or justification of action. The notion of power     as the arbiter requires no independent ideology to accompany it. By virtue     of its command over knowledge, it can manufacture justification to the     extent that the need for justification remains necessary in mass democracies.     For example, human survival is threatened by another major scientific/technological     development: genetic engineering, the technological concomitant of discoveries     generated by molecular biology. Gene splicing is a eugenic technoscience;     its justification is almost invariably built on the proposal to improve     the survival traits of the species by designing the gene rather than passively     accepting genetically related traits as unavoidable. Genetic engineering     is an intervention into evolution, an attempt to gain control over life     processes.          These examples are not, strictly     speaking, commensurable but are invoked to illustrate the range of issues     that are emerging to question technology and its twin, modern science.     Now the statement that science and technology have become inseparable     is certainly controversial, especially among those who would insist that     science is autonomous from the concerns of power and ideology. The division     between science and technology is meant to protect science from its implication     in the matrix of economic and political considerations, which are generally     recognized to influence - if not determine - the course of technological     development and its dispersion. It is still true, however, that most students     of science, while acknowledging the influence of what is often labeled     \"cultural factors\" on the process of knowledge acquisition, insist that     economic, political, and ideological questions must be strictly demarcated     from considerations bearing on the content of scientific knowledge. Instead,     the term \"scientific community\" has become identical with \"social context.\"     Indeed, recent developments in the social study of science have narrowed     this context to the laboratory, leaving other \"external\" influences aside.     Despite developments over the past thirty years which try to establish     a relation between scientific discourses and the historical and other     social conditions within which they function, support for the proposition     that science and the scientific milieu is relatively autonomous is still     powerful. In Part III, I shall explore developments in the philosophy,     history, and social study of science that have challenged the idea that     what counts as knowledge of the external world is attained by means of     scientific procedures alone. As we shall see, most investigators of science     remain tied to the concept of science as a distinct knowledge sphere and     have barely touched its relation to technology. The great exception, of     course, is Critical Theory, the foundation of which is to establish this          7          link and to assert the dominance of technology over science as well as     its domination over contemporary social relations.          The assertion that Western culture     is thoroughly technological derives from the German \"romantic\" critique     of the Enlightenment, a critique which members of the Frankfurt School     share with strains of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century neo-Kantian     thought, especially Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. After arguing     that the \"rationalism of the Age of Enlightenment is now out of the question,\"     Husserl nevertheless is quick to add, \"but their [the Enlightenment philosophies]     intention, in its most general sense, must never die out in us\"; the intention     is a \"humanity based on pure reason.\" 4 Max Horkheimer and Theodor     Adorno follow a similar line of argument. They lament the Enlightenment,     which created a new science and technology that could dominate nature     in order to promote the flowering of reason, but that led instead to its     eclipse. The end of reason was rooted in the belief, current even today,     that nature could be reduced to pure object, possessing mere quantitative     extension. The mathematicization and mechanization of the world picture     was undertaken by seventeenth-century science in the service of prediction     and control. In the process, according to Husserl, we lost contact with     the \"life world\" in a series of dualisms: mind and body, quantity and     quality, mathematic relations and human relations. For the Frankfurt School,     the logical result was positivism - the alienation of human reason from     itself.          Whereas Husserl's critique remains     at the level of philosophic discourse, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Herbert     Marcuse ascribed these dichotomies to the rending of society by social     domination. The domination of nature fulfills a human project, the domination     of people by people. Science and technology are practices that mirror     the social world.          Still, the Frankfurt School     was criticizing the enlightenment from within. Although Marcuse was     ambiguous concerning science, claiming at one point that a new science     free of technological domination needed to be created, he proclaims in     the final chapter of his One Dimensional Man that science     and technology \"are great vehicles of liberation\" if only they can be     subordinated to new ends to replace those of domination. These ends \"would     operate in the project and construction of machinery and not only in its     utilization.\" Technology can be instrumental \"in the reduction of toil     - it remains the very base of all forms of human freedom.\" 6 Thus,     the sharpest critics of science and technology hesitate at the door of     irrationalism and will not cross the threshhold, however harsh their evaluation     of the gloomy record          8          of domination that lies in the wake of modern science and technology.     On the other side, of course, lies reason's nemesis: religion, mysticism,     myth.          The warfare between what has     been called \"science\" and other discourses that purport to explain the     natural and social worlds is a story many times told. As Gaston Bachelard     has argued, science is constituted by its break from competing discourses     that claim to explain the same objects. 7 Physics, for example,     breaks with forms of \"irrationalism\" but also with metaphysics. As Bachelard's     contemporary, Karl Popper, has commented, \"metaphysics offers meanings     that may be helpful to other aspects of human affairs, but not science. 8     Science, for Popper and Bachelard, is established by statements that can     be subjected to refutation (in Bachelard's terms, \"empirical validation\").     It is the spirit and practice of relentless self-criticism that marks     science off from other discourses, including traditional philosophy. For     recent philosophers of science, even these procedures do not guarantee     that the results are identical with \"truth,\" only that they are demarcated     thereby from other discourses. Within true science, there may be serious     and often profound disputes of interpretation. But what all scientists     share is a community rooted     in method. The primacy of shared methods guarantees the reliability of     what counts as science. In Parts II and III we shall explore these assertions     in more detail. For now, it is enough to suggest that what those dedicated     to Western scientific ideology mean by the term \"science\" reduces to two     procedures: mathematical calculation and experimental validation/falsification     of results. Mathematics ensures the rigor of investigation, establishing     measurable relations and, in Bachelard's words, \"gives body to pure thought.\"     Mathematics is \"the realization of the rational.\" However, lest science     fall victim to Descartes's unwarranted \"refusal to base thought on experience,\"     experimentalism restores to observation its role as final arbiter of knowledge. 9           Presumably, neither philosophy     nor religion fulfills either of these criteria. Modern science demarcates     itself, not by reconstituting the object, but by defining rationality     in a specific way. At the same time, given the power of all metaphysical     discourses in everyday life, it is obliged to make room for the extrascientific     so long as these spheres are clearly subordinated to scientific rationality.     In the knowledge hierarchies of postfeudal societies, modern scientific     rationality is the privileged discourse, and. all others are relegated     to the margins. As a result, institutions of the state as well as the     economy -- education systems, government bureaus, the law and criminal     justice systems -- emulate scientific procedures within the constraints     imposed by their          9          own traditions and exigencies. Art and religion hold their places at the     margins of human endeavor and become extracurricular, or, to use Freud's     term, \"deflections,\" for the frustrations produced by the inhibition of     desire by the reality principle. 10           The rise of Protestantism in     leading industrializing countries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries     seemed to provide moral sanction for the preeminent position of modern     science as knowledge. Religious institutions now viewed themselves as     supplicants in an increasingly secular age and understood their role not     so much as deflectors but as moral guardians for individuals damaged by     the blandishments of money and power. The type of knowledge offered by     religion was confined to the ethical sphere; it concerned itself with     matters of family life, personal grief, and, when it felt obliged to take     social action, it was remedial rather than transformative. The great denominations     of Protestantism relinquished that which Catholicism had struggled to     retain: a claim on epistemological as well as ontological truth. However,     in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the triumph of world capitalism     over the remnants of the old feudal aristocracy in eastern and southern     Europe forced even the recalcitrant Catholic and other orthodox churches     to accommodate to the new order.          By the late nineteenth century,     industrial production depended on scientifically based technologies; the     craft traditions, of which early manufacturing was merely a form of rationalization,     were themselves subordinated to the new technology; the motive force of     production, energy, was no longer mechanical -- really an extension of     hand or water power -- but became electrical, the principles of which     derived from \"pure research\"; engineering replaced artisanal knowledge     in designing the mode of transformation of raw materials into end products;     in turn, the intellectual foundation of engineering became physics and     chemistry, which themselves were institutionalized into large laboratories     sponsored by and controlled by the state and large corporations. Thus,     science itself no longer is only a hegemonic ideology of the new social     order of capitalism and its industrial stage, but becomes integrated into     the practices and discourses of production. The inter-changeability of     science and technology is, of course, either denied or ignored by most     philosophers and scientists, but their growing convergence extends beyond     the workplace. 11 As scientific discourse permeates state and     civil society, scientific culture spills over beyond the laboratory. Business     dares make no decisions that are not grounded on mathematical calculation     that provides projections; legislators enact laws based on \"data\" generated     by scientifically trained experts Raymond Callahan has noted, referring     to education, that technological          10          criterion of efficiency becomes the new cult of public and private schools. 12      In schools, the idea of the liberal arts slowly gives way to occupational     education. \"Functional\" literacy becomes the criterion of success for     no-frills state school systems that are stripped of their music and drawing     curricula and which reduce English and history to service departments     for the technical-oriented programs. Therefore, in several dramatic moments     since World War II, beefing up science and math in schools has become     a matter of high government priority since these disciplines are understood     to be vital for a country's economic and military position in an increasingly     competitive and dangerous world.          Science education is accorded,     in the current anxiety over the loss of America's erstwhile preeminence     in industrial production, a primary role in the long road to restoration.     In the 1980s, as the defense budget of the United States has increased     dramatically, engineers and scientists are in demand in military-related     industries. Consequently, despite enormous pressure from government and     industry on schools, teacher recruitment in science and math has lagged,     primarily because salaries are far below those offered by private industry     and research institutions. Reversing its steadfast policy of reducing     federal expenditures and advocacy of scaled-down public services at all     levels, the Reagan administration saw the virtue of making an exception     for the teaching of science and math.          These illustrations do not exhaust     the extent to which technological culture penetrates the social world.     Right after World War II, as America assumed a position of economic, political,     and military dominance in the world, secularism -- always closely related     to the growth of modern science and technology -- seemed to have triumphed,     irrevocably, in the cultural sphere as well. Church attendance dropped     sharply, and religion in this most religious of modernized societies seemed     finally on the wane, a century after its final marginalization in most     industrialized European countries. 13           Technological culture may not     provide salve for the spirit, and it may do nothing to fill the void left     by the marginalization of religious morality, but, as even its most severe     critics are forced to admit, it gives rein to the pleasure principle.     As Marcuse observed, in advanced capitalist societies, especially the     United States, \"the defense structure makes life easier for a greater     number of people and extends man's mastery over nature.\" 14 Although     his description of technological society as a \"comfortable, smooth, democratic     unfreedom\" was adopted by some as a reason for opposing the prevailing     setup, millions who had been condemned to deprivation during the decades     of industrialization wel comed technology as a savior.          11           Culture was massified, overtaking high art     and marginalizing the intellectuals for whom it was sustenance, but providing     a respite from the drudgery of even the most automated labor. Marcuse     may have spoken for more than the intellectuals. His remorse for the contradictions     of the Enlightenment finally paled against the achievements of science     and technology. As a child of reason, he was unable to draw the logical     conclusion from his critique that science and technology had become obstacles     to freedom. Writing in the early 1960s, he could only allow that a transformed     science and technology might serve the emancipatory interest better than     the version that had emerged from the Dark Ages.          Goethe once quipped, \"He who     possesses science and art also has religion; but he who possesses neither     of these two, let him have religion.\" 15 The vision is a thoroughly     pluralist one. Science and art are to exist alongside religion, which     as Freud noted, echoing Goethe, was the possession of everyman, defined     as someone lacking the means to sublimate the irrepressible pleasure principle.     For the nineteenth-century poet or scientist, the idea that religion would     one more time raise its claim to yield reliable knowledge of the external     natural world was unthinkable. Freud is quite clear: the belief in the     supernatural is an \"untenable\" doctrine but better for the common folk     than alcohol or drugs. Just as long as it is not taken seriously as more     than an opiate. 16           But this is precisely what has     transpired in the past decade. Despite the unambiguous triumph of the     scientific worldview and the totalizing effects of technology, science     and technology are experiencing unprecedented attack. For the past fifteen     years, counterenlightenment religious movements have taken on worldwide     and revolutionary proportions. Far from disdaining politics as beneath     their ethical missions, some Jews, Moslems, and Christians alike have     laid siege to the state, demanding that public life conform to religious     precepts and that the separation of church and state be ended. The theocratic     state, once consigned by scholars, politicians, and jurists to the past,     is loudly proclaimed as the present and future by the new movements, and     has already captured important outposts in the Middle East -- within the     Moslem, Christian and Jewish worlds -- and is rapidly becoming the sine     qua non of political victory for parties in the United States. 17      Here, it is not only that lawmakers adopt biblical criteria for     establishing the rules of punishment; this is an old story in America.     The doctrine of retribution opposes itself to the idea that the criminal     may be subject to rehabilitation. In retrospect, liberal assumptions about     crime seem a brief interlude in an unbroken history of deep-seated, religiously     based conservatism in American law and political          12          life. Fundamentalist theology is reentering the public schools as well.     And among its adversaries, none is more significant than modern science.     As biologist Douglas Futuyama has warned, science is \"on trial\" and reason     is \"under fire.\" 18 A new science of creationism has challenged     the exclusive teaching of evolution in public schools and demanded that     its \"science\" be given equal treatment. This is no longer merely a case     of the ministry getting involved in politics, supporting candidates who     favor state aid to parochial schools. Such requests, made by the Catholic     Church for decades, challenge the separation of church and state but do     not confront the ideological hegemony of modern scientific doctrine. Indeed,     many parochial schools of Catholic and Protestant origins teach modern     science and mathematics as necessary elements of a relevant curriculum,     relevant, that is, to the job and career aspirations of their own constituencies.     The fundamental distinction between the old political intervention of     religious institutions, either on behalf of social justice or their own     parochial interests, and the new fundamentalism is that the latter condemns     enlightenment science as ideology, as one viewpoint in a plurality of     discourses possessing no privileged knowledge of the external world. Thus,     its demand for an equal place in the curriculum. In essence, fundamentalism     has stepped forward where enlightenment critics of science have stepped     back. For the purposes of this discussion, it is not relevant to point     out the absurdities of the creationist account of the origins of the universe,     life, and the evolution of species. At issue is the claim of enlightenment     science to certainty and its refusal to acknowledge its own discourse     as a form of ideology.          Take a case in point. In the     course of his attack against creationist accounts of development, Futuyama     makes two arguments: \"anyone who believes in Genesis as a literal description     of history must hold a world view that is entirely incompatible with the     idea of evolution, not to speak of science itself. . . where science insists     on material, mechanistic causes that can be understood by physics and     chemistry, the literal believer in Genesis invokes unknowable supernatural     forces.\" 19           The second argument is, for     Futuyama, more important: \"if the world and its creatures developed purely     by material, physical forces, it could not have been designed and has     no purpose or goal. The fundamentalist, in contrast, believes that everything     in the world, every species and every characteristic of every species,     was designed by an intelligent, purposeful artificer, and that it was     made for a purpose.\" 20 Futuyama defends evolution and the whole     of science as holding that \"mechanisms,\" not teleology, govern events     in nature. These mechanisms free science from reliance on Aristotelian     final causes and rely          13          instead on the sufficiency of efficient causes. Changes within and among     species can be ascribed not to ultimate purposes of God, but to the struggle     for existence, to adaptation by organisms to a changing environment. Futuyama's     underlying view is that of \"material, mechanistic\" explanations for natural     events: he identifies this view as identical with that of \"science.\"          Surely, the propositions of     evolutionary theory are incompatible with creationism. For modern biological     science, there is no question of plan or purpose in nature (although as     Alexandre Koyre shows, Newton was convinced that physical laws corresponded     to God's plan even if teleological explanation had no place in physics). 21      However, many evolutionists and philosophers of biology have come     to insist that Aristotle's idea of final cause, so vehemently rejected     by the early evolutionists, had a place in modern scientific theory. Stephen     J. Gould remarks:           It is still unfashionable in     biological circles to use such words as 'design,' 'purpose,' or     'teleology.' Since final cause is so indispensable a concept in the     elucidation of adaptation, and since natural selection can produce a     well-designed structure without any conscious intervention of God's     superhuman wisdom or the sub-human intelligence of the animal in question,     one would think that these terms would again be admitted into orthodoxy.     Evidently, however, we are still fighting the battle with theologians that     we won in deeds almost a century ago. 22            Futuyama may be one of those     still fighting the battle, but in his zeal to distance evolution from     theology, he succeeds only in making his ideas into the mirror image of     his opponent's. Francois Jacob puts the issue colorfully. Commenting on     the role of sexual reproduction as the \"aim\" for each organism and for the     history of organisms, he concludes, \"For a long time, the biologist     treated teleology as he would a woman he could not do without, but did not     care to be seen with in public. The concept of the programme has made an     honest woman out of teleology.\" 23           Today, the metaphors of program     and system to describe the processes of heredity and organic evolution     have opened a new debate concerning the question of causality in biological     science. The earlier belief that science could dispense with causal explanation     in favor of description was intended to remove from natural science what     Laplace termed the \"hypothesis\" of God's design. What has been termed     \"essentialism\" is not so easily removed. The religious counterattack against modern science may be misplaced, but it resonates          14           with a widespread     feeling among ordinary people that science has become a kind of priesthood     and that scientists, like the old priests, are not always forthcoming     about their own doubts, at least in public. The new attack on modern science,     however, is not mounted simply on the authority of the Bible is the true     word of God: it claims the mantle of science. Controversies within science     that reveal deep fissures within that community on questions such as causality     and truth have, until recently, been conducted behind closed doors. in     biology, the mechanical world picture is challenged; in physics, the image     of nature as pure objective extension, subject to prediction and control,     is questioned by those whose work functions at the level of theory, at     the same time practitioners insist that the old news is still best.          Perhaps the most broad-based     skepticism has arisen in the field of medicine. There are several issues     here: at the most fundamental level is the question of the traditional     medical model of diagnosis and treatment. According to this way of seeing,     the human body is a machine (in the older version) or a computer program     (in the up-to-date model). The parts are relatively autonomous, making     possible a treatment regimen that ignores the relations of the parts to     the whole, except in cases of side effects which can be counteracted.     In the old mold of medical practice, the relation of the person to the     environment and the emotional state to the physical state are irrelevant.     In the first instance, unless severe hunger is observed, nutritional issues     are not factored into diagnostic practice. The context of medical practice     itself -- treating individuals -- does not permit the effects of such     \"external\" phenomena as pollution, work environments, quality of life     based on economic circumstances, end stress related to working or family     life, to become objects of treatment.          Medicine, based on the findings     of molecular biology, adopts a systems approach to both diagnosis and     treatment. In the more ecological mode, the human body is an open-ended     system that is determined by its genetic code,     but may be influenced by the     environment with which it has homeostatic relations. In the less interesting     version, the body is a dosed system consisting of information networks     that are only peripherally subject to external influences. Francis Crick's     version of the basic requirements for life includes the Darwinian idea,     adapted from Thomas Malthus, that the organism must compete for water,     food, and other life-sustaining resources. But, In the final accounting,     its capacity for survival, he argues, is its internally generated information     system which is built up from its molecular structures. 24 Second     is its capacity to mutate In the wake of changing conditions, a capacity               15          that is given internally. Recent medical science has taken its picture     from Crick and his associate James Watson, who together played key roles     in developing molecular biology. The organism itself remains the object     of study, pristine in Its singularity but seen not so much as a series     of parts but as a system of \"organized complexity\" whose driving force     is the molecular structure of the gene. 25 We treat individuals     differently than before. Since \"the problem of life is a problem of organic     chemistry,\" 26 measures taken to repair damaged organs should     seek both diagnosis and treatment in dysfunctions in chemical combinations     that affect the organ's information program. Thus, such diverse pathologies     as psychosis and cancer become subject to chemical treatment. One seeks     the reasons for various emotional illnesses not in the stresses produced     by the life situation but in chemical malfunctions. Similarly, the most     widely used treatment for some cancers is chemotherapy.          Of course, medical applications     of molecular biology are only one of the major changes initiated by this     new discipline. More controversial, and surely more problematic, have     been the new technologies of genetic engineering which present themselves,     in their visionary manifestations, as fulfilling the dream of both nineteenth-century     eugenics and modern medicine to eliminate disuse by altering those traits     that make humans less competitive in a changing physical environment.     According to Jeremy Rifkin, \"we are virtually hurling ourselves into the     age of biotechnology.\" Molecular biology has succeeded in changing the     heredity of the gene, transferring genes from one organism to another     and, perhaps, more powerfully, has synthesized cells through engineering.     Its most recent applications in food technology promise to eliminate the     need for chemical preservatives.     Molecular biology is a science     with a purpose and design: it seeks to transform life by recombining DNA     which it has postulated as the core of life. This aim surely violates a     wide spectrum of religious principles but also raises profound ethical     issues. For, even if altering or remaking life were to be judged a worthy     social purpose, the question is to whom are scientists performing these     tasks to be accountable? This issue is in the process of adjudication by law and the courts in the     United States, and the results are, to some, horrifying. The industrial     state Of mind has dominated these discoveries and in the United States,     this means private ownership and control of the means of production     (splicing) and of the product (altered organisms). Indeed MIT has recently     forged an extensive series of arrangements with some major biotechnology     firms. In return for huge grants for research the university has agreed     that the patents for discoveries will belong to the   16 corporations. Courts have     decided that these arrangements are legal because they have viewed     bioengineering as simply one more industry. In a free society, so the     argument goes, we may sanction a free market in gene splicing just as we     recognize the free market in the production of steel or cars.     Measures to prevent corporations from engaging in commerce violate     their rights under law.          Two major issues are raised     by these developments. The first is whether we can afford to free the     new discoveries associated with bio-technologies from rigorous public     control, assuming we could identify an appropriate regulatory agency.     The second strikes to the heart of the conflict between modern science     and religion, but has also been framed by nonfundamentalists who, nevertheless,     hold to ethical beliefs that are counter to some types of scientific investigation.     Simply stated, the issue is whether modern science has a right to alter     our relationship with nature, sui generis. On the one side, the     fundamentalists argue against any scientific discoveries that may violate     the word of God as they have interpreted it. For those who would reject     such objections on the grounds that they are \"irrational,\" the alternative     does not imply accepting the new biotechnologies. For if the aim of bioengineering     is to transform our relation to nature, especially our own \"nature,\" then     the claim of science to be free of purpose, to be engaged in some anterior     conception of \"pure\" science is most suspect. If modern science does not     imply the intervention of supernatural powers, it nonetheless cannot escape     interrogation of its underlying ethical assumptions, neither with respect     to the content of its propositions, which it calls \"laws\" of nature, nor     with respect to its responsibility for the results of its investigations.          What is at stake here is the     question of entailment. If     molecular biology chooses to link its discoveries in DNA and RNA research     to industrial tasks, are we not justified to ask whether such discoveries     do themselves entail ethically problematic purposes? This becomes especially     relevant at a time when universities, the traditional seats of scientific     research, are making agreements with large corporations and the government,     which provide the bulk of the funds for their work. Under these circumstances,     the claim of free inquiry becomes difficult to sustain.     Yet, it would be a mistake to     declare that science and technology are entirely determined, in their     content as well as their uses, by the hands that feed them. Science is a     complex, multivaried activity. Its relation to what it \"observes\" is never     unmediated: that is, the economic, political, and social environment     in which people \"do\" science and technology intervenes between     cognition and its object. Alexandre Koyre, 17   who vehemently rejects     explanations for scientific discovery that depend on the practical     conditions that may spur it on, substitutes metaphysics and philosophy as     mediations between theory, experiment, and nature. Similarly, Paul     Davies ascribes the continuing popularity of astronomy to the fact     that the study of the heavens is not far from our common and still     passionate desire for transcendence, for the supernatural. At the same     time, he emphasizes the rebelliousness of nature, its \"inherent     uncertainty,\" its \"randomness,\" and the significance of     \"subjectivity\" in the new physics. According to Davies, the \"observer is     beginning to play a rather essential role in the nature of the world,\"     making absurd objectivist concepts of time and space, including those that     impute to nature an inherent order. 27           Indeed, difficulties experienced     by partisans of a picture of nature as a unified field have generated     major debates within physics. It is generally recognized by physicists     themselves that few of its discoveries are exempt from the variability     brought to them by interpretation. The facts do not speak for themselves     and, through this door, marches religion and other metaphysical doctrines     as well as philosophy. In Part Ill, I shall discuss the relation between     philosophies and the social conditions that may give rise to them, challenging     Koyre and others who wish to preserve the internalist account of science     by limiting the context of discovery to purely intellectual influences.     Suffice it to mention here that many who speak of nature as a unified     field tread dangerously close to teleology, and even God, as the ultimate     purpose. David Bohm, a theoretical physicist, asserts the formal unity     of all natural phenomena, defining physical laws as tending toward the     absolute through the study of partial, relative phenomena; most important,     he defends causality in nature as an unlimited principle. That is, for     Bohm, order, not randomness, is inherent in nature, the truth of which     can be grasped by science. Although he has no recourse to the supernatural,     Bohm insists that there are \"hidden variables\" in quantum mechanics that     belie the picture of randomness and indeterminacy put forward by such     thinkers as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. 28      In short, the struggle between     mechanistic science and religion reappears in different form within     science itself. As I have shown, teleology is almost respectable in     biology, and one of the great debates initiated by Einstein     (unwittingly) and Heisenberg (with some hesitation) is whether God plays     dice with the universe. Some of the key interpretative struggles     within physics are whether we may posit real time and space, and whether     the intervention of \"subjectivity\" removes these categories from the realm     of objectivity. More broadly, the question remains: what do we know when     we know something? If our knowl- 18   edge is ineluctably bound up     with the processes of observation and experiment, and if these are     permeated with a priori assumptions about the character of the observed or     the uses to which knowledge is destined to be put, in what sense can we     say that science as a type of knowledge is superior to metaphysics,     including religion?     Social ecology and radical     feminism, two social movements of considerable political and     ideological weight in many advanced industrial societies have, from an     ethical standpoint, challenged the content and results of contemporary     science and technology. Both have their roots in the 1960s and early 1970s     when a general skepticism about the autonomy of science was invoked     because of the subordination of much of the scientific community to     military requirements, and the propping of scientific research and     technological innovation by industry. Yet, the content of their critique     differs from the assertion that the problem of science and technology     consists essentially in the uses to which discovery and innovation     are put. Instead, social ecology and radical feminism have mounted a     fundamental critique of the scientific worldview, especially the     contention that science and technology are neutral instruments that can be     separated from the context in which they are developed. Social ecology     argues that science and technology, by virtue of their subordination to     the interest of the domination of nature, share responsibility with the     state and capitalist corporations for the \"death of nature,\" a metaphor     that describes the increasing danger to life wrought by scientifically     based technology. Rather than blame the growing problem of environmental     pollution merely on the lack of state regulation, ecologists argue that     technologies of boundless domination are leading to ecological     disaster. On the one hand, the idea of nature as pure \"object\" has been a     normal presupposition of practical physics insofar as it has enabled     nature to be defined by categories of pure extension in the service of     prediction and control. On the other hand, the imperiousness of molecular     biology consists in its eugenic ideology, its eagerness to play God by     altering the distinctive characteristics of our species. Ecologists     explain the rebelliousness of nature as a reaction to human interventions     that disturb its internal relations and its homeostatic relations with     various species of life. The consequences of the industrial logic that     marks contemporary biology can be dangerous to life. But the explanation     given by social ecology for this state of affairs transcends the purview     of social policy. What enables science to engage in life endangering     activities is a belief that humans may insure their future by subjecting     the gene to engineering, just as earlier industrialists exploited     nonrenewable raw materials to advance various ends, including profits and     the promise of liberation   19 from material hardship and other socially     approved values. Here we are engaged in a drama of both intention and     unintentional consequences. The ideology of nature as \"other\" or     \"matter\" undifferentiated by quality and infinitely fungible is a     necessary condition for a science that has integrated itself into     technology, in which the difference between them becomes analytic rather     than ontological. Theoretical physics and biology may try to hold     themselves aloof from the uses to which their discoveries may be put;     Einstein certainly did not mean to lend his discoveries to the invention     of weapons of nuclear destruction, and seventeenth-century     astronomers may not have performed their work exclusively for the sake of     improving instruments of navigation. Nor is it necessary to make     direct connections between developments in wave mechanics and the     rise of communications technology. The arguments made by those who try to     discover, both by empirical research and by inference, a commercial or     industrial telos in processes of discovery are certainly misdirected.     The point is, rather, to examine the tendency of scientific ideology, the     stuff of which discovery is made, that is, to situate science as a     discourse within a larger system of social relations in which economic and     political influences do not necessarily appear directly in the     laboratory.          Ecology takes two directions     on this issue. One is to argue from what might be called a historical     standpoint: this is no longer the age of the individual thinker puttering     in the laboratory under conditions similar to those of the artist. While     scientific procedures may be considered quite distinct from those of the     artist (except perhaps the composer of music), the creative side of science     was, at the time of Galileo and even Lavoisier, commensurable with that     of art. Scientific and artistic work requires months, perhaps years, of     drudgery. But the process of scientific discovery in the seventeenth and     eighteenth centuries, and even well into the nineteenth, was marked by     individual effort. The scientist, like the artist, worked alone or with     very small groups. Then comes Pasteur, in the later years of the century,     a professor who, as Bruno Latour reports, attaches himself to forces of     industry and the state and makes science a social force. 29 Latour's     narrative of Pasteur's claim that he had made a serum that cured an anthrax     epidemic in France was not validated through reproducible experiments     made by scientists but by three institutions possessing the power to certify     such a claim: the scientific community, of course; milk processors and     producers requiring some relief from a costly and nearly devastating outbreak     of the disease among cattle; and the state. Latour's conclusion is not     that \"society\" influences the course of science, but that the laboratory     becomes a model for social power. Drawing on FoucauIt's thesis          20          that the knowledge/power relation becomes characteristic of modern society,     not only does Latour posit this conjuncture as the condition of scientific     truth, but he conversely argues that traditional institutional power draws     its strength from the laboratory which in the twentieth century becomes     a producer of commodities and of social power. Latour wishes to demonstrate     that science is not subordinate to capital, as Marx and Marxists argue,     but has become a crucial form of capital, with the laboratory a site of     its production. Science retains some of the features of art, but the process     of scientific discovery has been permanently removed from anything resembling     an autonomous sphere.          Science lends itself to integration     because it shares, with the rest of society, the teleology of domination     over nature. Its incorporation into industry and the state may be necessary     for the survival of nations, considering the world economic and political     order. But, as these ecologists contend, such a close relationship between     science and the forces of order means that industry has been able to multiply     its productive powers by geometric proportions over industrial production     in the (relatively) prescientific age. Specifically, the transformation     of physical, chemical, and biological knowledge into instruments of economic,     political, and military power is the foundation of our ecological crisis.          It does not matter that the     scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic/industrial     and military power. The evidence is overwhelming that such is the case.     Thus, every major industrial power has a national science policy; the     United States military appropriates billions each year for \"basic\" as     well as \"applied\" research. The National lnstitutes of Health provide     vast sums for research that will be transformed into industrial technologies     by private corporations which, in turn, make products for industry and     for mass consumption that often spell disaster for the environment. What     distinguishes this indictment from the criticisms of environmentalists     is the demand by ecologists for new social arrangements that embody a     radically new principle in our collective relationship to nature. Their     demand for an ecologically pacific natural environment threatens the organized     complexity of the marriage of science and industry in every country. The     collective nature of scientific research is made possible only by the     investments of the state and large corporations. Better to halt this form     of science and return to science as art. Under such circumstances, a way     of life would come to an end, for scientific and technological development     underlies rising standards of living in the most industrially developed     countries. Beyond the standard of living is a whole concept of culture     based upon consumption, our notions of the relation-          21          ship between work and what we call \"leisure,\" in short, our relationship     to experience. That the \"technological sensorium\" dominates everyday life     seems hardly disputable. 30 The question is whether this is     what we want. Ecology normatively challenges this sensorium rather than     focusing only on its effects. It has formed and inspired movements, political     parties, and massive protests against those who employ scientifically     produced technologies that, in its view, inhibit freedom. What is at stake     in its alternative is the possibility of constructing a social ethic that     proposes different assumptions about what constitutes the good life. For     the philosophy of ecology, a world without domination, domination of nations,     of women, of nature, of cultures, requires a radically different conception     of science and technology since what it entails is a radically new idea     of the everyday.     Ecology's critique of science     and technology, while not ostensibly religious, suggests that ethical     neutrality with respect to the results of scientific enterprise is not     justified. The ecological position, in its most sophisticated formulation,     challenges the idea that any form of human knowledge can be separated from     its consequences. If one finds that science has made an alliance with     prevailing forces of destruction to further the interest of domination of     humans, its position as an unassailable, almost sacrosanct discourse     must be overturned. Murray Bookchin, perhaps America's most trenchant and     global ecological theorist, puts the case:           In our discussions of modern     ecological and social crises, we tend to ignore the more underlying     mentality of domination of each other and by extension of nature. I refer     to an image of the natural world that sees nature as \"blind,\" \"mute,\"     \"cruel,\" \"competitive,\" and \"stingy,\" a seemingly demonic \"realm of     necessity\" that opposes \"man's\" striving for freedom and self-realization.     . . . This all-encompassing image of an intractable nature that must be     tamed by a rational humanity has given us a domineering form of reason,     science and technology. 31            To this image, Bookchin     opposes \"an ecological standpoint: nature as a constellation of     communities . . . freed of all anthropocentric moral trappings, a     participatory realm of interacting life forms whose most outstanding     attributes are fecundity, creativity and directedness marked by     complementarity.\" 32  Bookchin     clearly identifies traditional notions of reason, science, and technology     with the identification of nature with the capitalist marketplace (itself     linked to conventional evolution theory, which, as I have noted, is     adapted by Darwin from 22   Malthusian conceptions of     natural history). In effect, Bookchin counterposes nature in     metaphors derived from art to those of enlightenment science, which     has employed the metaphors of commodity relations. In both cases, we     have recourse to ethical discourses in which telos is present as a     regulative principle. Enlightenment science, which believes itself free of     references to purpose, and aim in its conception of nature, has, as     Bookchin shows, simply portrayed nature in the image of capitalist social     relations. In contrast, reflecting the views of a wide spectrum of     ecological thought, Bookchin frankly admits that ecology pictures nature     as an active, purposive agency, clinging to standard notions of     objectivity when he tries to distance ecological thought from     \"anthropocentric moral trappings.\" This anachronism in Bookchin's     discourse reveals not so much the weakness of ecological ideas as the     strength of science as a hegemonic ideology. For the meaning of \"hegemony\"     consists precisely in its presence within the discourse of opponents     of the dominant ideology. At the same time, it can be argued that the     ecological and feminist critiques of modern science are based on exposing     science as ideology by means of showing its subjectivity, its character as     ambiguous moral agent.     The explosion of the modern     feminist movement since the late l960s has generated what is perhaps the     richest body of social theory in the last twenty years. This is not to     ignore the extraordinary work of Simon de Beauvoir or earlier theorists     of feminism such as Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 33 or the many feminist     novelists whose critiques of marriage and the family were framed within     conventional literary forms. Feminist theory has sought to explore the     position of women in the West as well as the Third World in a great number     of intellectual fields. Feminist historians have sought to debunk the myth     that there is no \"her\" story in economic, political, and cultural terms.     Since, as Walter Benjamin remarked, history is written by the victors, the     hidden story of women's struggles for equality and escape from the yoke of     male domination has to be told by other women who will explore the     underside of dominant narratives. This history joins the general movement     of social history that has succeeded in uncovering the lives of working     people, black slaves, and other \"invisible\" groups denied a public     identity by those who are the appointed guardians of official history.     Sociologists and anthropologists have explored the lives of women engaged     in homemaking, and have sought to restore to that activity the name     labor.\" 34 Others have theorized the equal social weight of the labor of     biological and social reproduction -- especially child rearing -- with that     of material production, arguing     that women participate as workers in both spheres but have been     systematically 23 expunged from considerations     of questions of social relations and power. In short, the lives of women,     their forms of self-production and self-organization, their successes and     failures, have been the loud silence in historical and social scientific     studies. A whole army of feminist scholars have made enormous efforts     to recover women's voices, to uncover the specificity of women's     discourse.          The attempt to find women's     voice in science, especially in scientific discovery, proceeds according     to at least two major roads of inquiry. First is to assert that women     have participated in science and technology, if not as equals, at least     in considerable depth. The figures of geneticist Barbara McClintock, organizational     and technological theorist Lillian Gilbreth, physical therapist Sister     Elizabeth Kenny, and physicist Marie Curie are invoked only to illustrate     the range of contributions that women have made to scientific and technological     discovery. Citing Erik Erickson's question, \"what will happen to science     if and when women are truly represented in it -- not by a few glorious     exceptions, but in the ranks of the scientific elite?\" Evelyn Fox Keller     is quick to remind us that despite McClintock's contribution to understanding     the mechanism of inheritance, she is still the exception, and that science     is dominated by men. 36 Extensive study of McClintock's difficult     travail as a genuine theorist rather than practitioner of normal science     was meant to illustrate that, as a visionary, she faced resistance from     a scientific elite ensconced in its own assumptions and prejudices against     women, and that the moral neutrality of scientists could not be assumed     despite the possibility that McClintock offered new knowledge. Keller's     interest is to show that sex and gender relations bear on the exclusion     of women from scientific communities and that these relations are deeply     rooted in the ideology of Western culture, inscribed in its most eminent     philosophical works -- that woman is other, is identified with nature,     and is an object of domination. Francis Bacon, one of the formative figures     in the development of modern scientific ideology, was also a key proponent     of the identity of science with male power. Nor was he exceptional. Keller's     reading of Plato's Symposium and     Phaedrus reveals the close relationship of male sexuality and the production     of knowledge. Knowledge for Plato is erotically based, but closed to female     participation 37           While affirming that gender     has become a crucial element in the exclusion of women from science, Keller     rejects the idea advanced by some feminist writers that Western science     is male science. In feminist theory, this concept seeks to remove from     Western science the mantle of objectivity by proving that its antiecological     practices -- and, even more significant, the mathematicization of nature     and the scientific          24          ethic of prediction and control -- are steps toward the exclusion of women     and undermine modern science's universalism claims. Whereas Keller confines     her critique to the exclusion of women from the scientific elite, Carolyn     Merchant contrasts the modern scientific worldview which is formed by     the dual concepts of \"mechanism and the domination of nature\" with an     earlier \"organic-oriented mentality\" that held to a nurturing image of     the earth, an image of which the womb, woman/mother are the central referents. 38      According to Merchant, the replacement of this imagery, which survived     as late as the Renaissance, by the mechanical world picture is linked     to commercialization and industrialization, which remain the animus of     our contemporary social world. These images had been a crucial feature     of Western civilization, functioning as an \"ethical constraint\" on mining     and other activities that destroyed the earth. Thus, Merchant historicizes     modern science and, far from conceiving it as \"progressive,\" argues that     it represents a regression from an earlier science that was prevalent     in ancient civilization. \"Violence\" against the earth is consonant with     violence against women, since earth relates to humans as mother to child.     Man's conquest of nature, then, is analogous to dominating women. For     Merchant, it is impossible to abstract the development of modern science     and technology from this process.     This is an example of one     vision of what has become known as the \"feminist standpoint.\" In the     materialist account, the sexual division of labor in which women have been     made subordinate to men in all aspects of their existence -- material     production, social reproduction, especially in their enforced role of     chief, if not sole, child rearer -- has consequences for the character of     knowledge. Knowledge is gender differentiated, according to Nancy     Hartsock, because the sexual division of labor forces women to occupy a     different position in the social structure. 39 This position is     not induced by the biological differences between men and women but is,     instead, socially constructed. She acknowledges these differences but     argues that we can never know the degree to which they might influence, if     not determine, the forms of knowledge until sexual divisions are     abolished.          This is the \"objectivist\" account     of the feminist standpoint insofar as it does not rely for its argument     on the actual consciousness of women. Rather, following Marx and Georg     Lukacs, the structure of Hartsock's argument reiterates the view that     social being determines social consciousness but substitutes women for     the proletariat. Otherwise, one would have to adopt the viewpoint that     knowledge is free of its material preconditions, that there is an unmediated     relationship          25          between the knower and known. Hartsock's central metaphors are those of     political economy, although she draws liberally on the psychoanalytic     literature of object relations as well. Yet, the ideas of commodification,     appropriation, exploitation, and oppression are the crucial analytic categories     in her attempt to establish a specifically feminist discourse or standpoint.          Hartsock does not spell out     the implications of such a view for the relation of gender and science,     but her account bears on the production of knowledge. Even though Hartsock     distances herself from culturalist versions of feminism such as those     offered by Merchant, Mary Daly, and Susan Griffin -- all of whom represent     the fall of civilization in terms of the transformation from maternal,     or female, images and myths to those of masculinity -- she adopts their     theory of knowledge while framing it within Marxist concepts of historical     materialism. Her criteria for the concept of feminist standpoint is totally     derived from the presuppositions of Marxist theory in its Lukacsian form,     including the idea that the standpoint of the exploited or the oppressed     makes possible the unmasking of prevalent social relations that produce     oppressive conditions of life. That there is a specifically woman's experience     of the world is beyond question. What needs to be interrogated, however,     is whether this experience produces a feminist epistemology. Like Merchant,     Hartsock reads masculine epistemology into the history of Western philosophy.     Hegel's master-slave dialectic, in which the self is formed through a     \"life and death struggle,\" is ascribed by Hartsock to class and masculine     relations, thus denying its universality. Males are afflicted with dualistic     consciousness; they live in, but are not of, the family. Their formative     experiences are of an abstract character \"and a denial of the relevance     of the material world to the attainment of what is of fundamental importance:     love of knowledge, or philosophy (masculinity). The duality of nature     and culture takes the form of a devaluation of work, or necessity, and     then primacy instead of a purely social interaction for the attainment     of undying fame.\" 40 Beginning with a materialist account of     women's position in social reproduction, Hartsock finds common ground     with cultural feminism's attack against science as the realm of the abstract     and the identification of women with nature. But she goes further to link     masculinity to the pursuit of knowledge as an abstract ideal. In this     paradigm, women are concerned with the affective realm, men with the cognitive;     women are consigned to the concrete, men to the abstract. Women are nature,     males culture. Of course, these antinomies are the elements of masculine     ideology. But Hartsock does not stop there. For her critique of the          26          antinomies of sexist thought has a point: it is to construct an image     of women that is represented as the real in contrast to the male imaginary:                Women's construction of     self in relation to others leads in an opposite direction --toward     opposition to dualism of any sort; valuation of concrete, everyday life; a     sense of a variety of connectedness and continuities both with other     persons and with the natural world. If material life structures     consciousness, women's relationally defined existence, bodily experience     of boundary challenges, and activity of transforming both physical objects     and human beings must be expected to result in a world view to which     dichotomies are foreign. 41      In other words, there is a     feminist standpoint which radically transforms the nature of     knowledge. This is so because science derives from its philosophical     presuppositions, which, if we are to follow Hartsock's logic, are rooted     in the conditions of material existence. Hartsock omits discussion of the     concrete knowledge that can be derived from this standpoint and of the     degree to which it would differ from that proposed by the male worldview;     she does not provide a method for arriving at that knowledge. For the     present, we must confine ourselves to the structure of her argument.     Hartsock's critique, unlike those of ecofeminism and cultural feminism,     stands firmly on the twin sciences of psychoanalysis and Marxist theory of     historical change, historical materialism. These are, of course,     derivative of the abstract, universal premises of enlightenment philosophy     of science. For both, the self is constructed out of the manifold     relations into which it enters; it is not a thing, sui generis. Freud and Marx share     the idea that the self is a reified construction masking deeper relations     that are to be uncovered by scientific investigation. In each case,     we are constrained to employ abstract, a priori categories such as the     psychic structure with its three parts (Freud) or the mode of production of     material life with its two elements being forces and relations of     production (Marx). In each case, the domination of nature becomes the     precondition for the formation of self; it is the structuring relation     within which class or psychic relations fight it out. So, if we are     to follow Hartsock, her own theoretical sources are intimately entwined     with masculine forms of knowledge, and the price of appropriating these     modes of knowing must be calculated. Her own description of the categories     of the feminist epistemology are strikingly similar to those produced     by the cultural feminists. Women are concrete; their relation to     nature is continuous rather than dualistic; \"dichotomies are foreign\"     to their way of     27   knowing. These conclusions     also appear in the discourses of Merchant, Daly, and Griffin,     although they make no claim to follow the precepts of male-oriented     science. Instead, they offer an alternative myth to that of science: the     ancient times were a golden age when feminist ways of relating to nature     were dominant. Then, \"commercialism and industrialism\" signaled a fall     from grace or, in Daly's account, patriarchy appeared as a violent     counterrevolution to maternal culture. 42 Merchant's apocryphal,     utopian history becomes a weapon in the feminist struggle against     male science. Premodernity, regarded by the Enlightenment as a static and     reactionary worldview, becomes, for this version of the feminist     standpoint, a science that views the \"cosmos as a living unit\" in which     humans were linked both to the heavens and to other animals. Aristotle,     whose cosmology became the object for refutation by     seventeenth-century science, is here regarded as a flawed but essentially     ecological thinker. Merchant does not render the history of the     transformation of science as a struggle of ideas. As I have noted, she     points to material, economic reasons for the changing assumptions of     science. But since she adopts a frankly utopian and political standpoint,     her account of the \"death of nature\" does not rely on material categories     of causality. Instead, she weaves myth and science together in a     mosaic that takes ideas seriously as historical agents. Hartsock, on the     other hand, manifests the contradiction of a logocentric method with     feminist ideology of organicism.          In a future work, I explore     the substance of feminist and ecological claims about science. For the     present, it is sufficient to open the discussion. Religious, ecological,     and cultural feminist objections to modern science differ in many ways.     What unites them is their condemnation of the failure of science to come     to terms with its own social and political commitment. The virtue of feminist     critiques of science is that they try to go beyond the tendency prevalent     among ecologists, environmentalists, and others, to confine their objections     to the uses without challenging the philosophical presuppositions of science     the content of contemporary scientific theories, or the methods of science.     Merchant has provided a critique, parallel to that of the Frankfurt School,     which focuses on the metaphysical foundations of modern science and suggests,     following the lead of Adrienne Rich that the pejorative metaphor of women     as \"other\" to male reason \"divested of the trappings of patriarchy, gives     rise to a distinctively female bond with nature.\" 43 If the     feminist critique of science as a but not the form of reason     is right, it may occupy no privileged position with respect to knowledge     of nature. It is a way of knowing, burdened with presuppositions permeated     with the interest of (male) domination of women/na-          28          ture. These presuppositions, derived from the social world, configure     its results. Thus, we may subject the scientific method to scrutiny as     well as the overwhelming tendency of some strains of physics and biology     toward reductionism, especially their denial of the concepts of levels     according to which biology, psychology, and social science are discourses     whose object of knowledge is irreducible to physical and chemical properties.     For feminism, the problems of social relations are not subsumed by basic     biological drives, which, in turn, are derived from \"organic chemical     reactions.\" At the same time, the feminist standpoint invokes metaphors     of women's physiology to describe nature.          In sum, the mechanical and reductionist     worldview of natural science is under siege from three major movements     that have questioned the gulf separating scientific knowledge from moral     and ethical considerations. Among the weapons of criticism employed by     these movements, none is more powerful than the readings of the canon     of scientific philosophy since the post-Socratics. The evidence of what     Max Black calls \"models and metaphors\" in the laws of science reveal the     extent to which the categories of myth still pervade science and, particularly,     its inability to eliminate human purpose from the multiple issues surrounding     scientific discovery.     To be sure, science itself has     provided the impetus for much of this work. For, as historians and     philosophers of science have tried to demonstrate, recent profound     changes in the scientific picture of the world have reinserted the subject     into scientific discovery, have revived once hated theories, and have     introduced uncertainty about the question whether science \"needs\" a     teleological hypothesis to explain its discoveries. The reinstatement     of teleology and neo-Lamarckian ideas in biology, uncertainty in physics,     parapsychology and the religious connection to the big bang theory in     cosmology points to scientific communities that are philosophically     and even metaphysically rent. While the public face of science remains     resolutely rationalistic, doubt is creeping in; some scientists have     launched their own movement against corporate and military control over     research, demanding once again a return to the autonomy of scientific     work. And, as was true of physics and biology in the past, the merger of     theoretical science with philosophy has reappeared, even as some     philosophers of science insist that they have nothing to offer the     acquisition of positive knowledge -- their role is merely to clear up     misunderstandings.          Since the relativity and quantum     mechanics debates of the first third of the twentieth century, in which     theoretical physicists openly clashed on questions of interpretation of     the results of discovery, historians,          29          sociologists, and even a few philosophers of science have been given \"permission\"     to interrogate science and to suggest, however meekly, that there are     ideological elements of scientific theory. I shall discuss these developments     in some detail in Part III. For now, it is enough to remark that there     exists widespread skepticism concerning the autonomy of science within     the scientific community itself as well as social movements and a section     of the populations of industrialized countries. Some scientists, philosophers,     and social scientists are exploring the historical and social constitution     of science, especially the \"facts\" that constitute scientific knowledge.     They have concluded, in various ways, that what might be called the \"social     relations\" of science, including the worldviews that are constitutive     of scientific knowledge, are inseparable from the results of discovery.     The philosophy, history, and sociology of science explores the claim of     modern science (a) to be independent of the social/historical context     within which it works and (b) to discover \"facts\" that, even if theory-dependent,     correspond to the external world. The first debate concerns the autonomy     of science from the conditions of the production of knowledge. Since Thomas     Kuhn's suggestion (1962) that paradigm shifts in science were dependent     not only on \"shifts in perceptions,\" a concept borrowed from N. Hanson     (1958), 44 but also upon changes in the context within which     scientific discovery took place, historians and sociologists of science     have tried to get a handle on these presumably \"external\" influences upon     scientific development. Those who wish to preserve the fundamental autonomy     of science, such as Koyre, Hanson, and Kuhn himself, confine these extraideational     influences to the scientific community, defined variously in broader terms,     or, as in some recent sociological histories and studies, to the laboratory. 45      The exceptions (see Paul Forman, 1971) 46 speak of an     episteme, or cultural environment, that may influence the content of scientific     theory. However, only Marxism has provided a social/historical interpretation     that encompasses both science and technology, explaining their development     in relation to large economic, political, and ideological transformations.          Perhaps it was the mechanical     correspondence theory of scientific truth employed by Marxism after Marx     that resulted in the deafening silence with which mainstream philosophers,     historians, and social scientists greeted its accounts. When Marx and     the Marxists are discussed, it is only to dismiss them as in Koyre's summary     refutation cited above. The mainstream tradition in the sociology of science,     represented by Robert Merton and the Columbia school, confines its explorations     of the social context of science to studies of the scientific community,     particularly \"institutional and ethical factors\" such as the          30          character of scientific education, and networks of personal relations     based on schools attended and scientific organizations. 47 Even     the \"new social studies in science,\" -- grouped around the Edinburgh School     (Barry Barnes, David Bloor), Michael Mulkey, Karin Knorr-Cetina, and,     in a somewhat different vein, Steve Woolgar and Bruno Latour -- have,     in the name of abolishing the dichotomy between internalist and externalist     explanations, fashioned a microsociology of knowledge in which the actual     interactions of working scientists, their discourse concerning observations,     and their negotiations as to what they actually \"saw\" constitute scientific     facts. 48 These accounts differ from Mertonian sociology insofar     as the social studies school argues in various ways that scientific facts     are constructed socially, but the scientific community is often made nearly     identical with the social. In this connection, one of the dominant strains     of the social study of science has become ethnomethodology, a derivative     of phenomenology; recent sociology of science seeks to actually locate     the point of production of scientific knowledge as the outcome of intersubjectivity.     In recent times, only the Edinburgh School and Bruno Latour attempt to     link scientific knowledge with social interest, owing much in this respect     to the Marxist and neo-Marxist conceptions of ideology.          Although social studies of science,     including the older work of Merton, do not ignore Marxism, it is also     true that the historical perspective on science and technology that has     been closely identified with the Marxist tradition is marginal to this     work. As I shall show in Part III, historiographic works on science, following     Koyre and Kuhn, remain embedded in the problem of intertextuality, that     is, the relation of scientific ideas to philosophy, or, more broadly,     the prevailing mentality of a historical period. Missing in these accounts     are concrete studies in the social relations of science that go beyond     the laboratory or professional contexts within which scientists act.     In Part 1, I discuss the     theory of scientific discovery emanating from Marx and Engels. As we shall     see, controversies concerning this question within Marxism reveal     differences of interpretation as wide as those in the philosophy of     science and technology. Moreover, as I shall show, Marxism, following     Marx's own ambivalence, mirrors the debates in every discipline concerning     the general question of what constitutes science; the relevance of social     relations to the form and substance of scientific knowledge, that is, to     what counts as knowledge; and, more broadly, the relation of science to     what is called \"society.\"          I follow with an examination     of the Marxist tradition, in its \"orthodox\" version emanating from the     theorists of the Second and          31          Third Internationals as well as from those who may be designated as \"neo-Marxist.\"     My main point in Part II is that the transformations within Marxism tend     to follow changes in mentalities that accompany both social and cultural     developments and the ideologies embedded within them. Like natural science     itself, Marxism is not immune from the controversies of the time(s) within     which it theorizes social and natural phenomena.          At the same time, Marxism is     constantly confronted with a disruption not experienced by other perspectives.     This consists in the problem of reconciling its own claim to be a \"science,\"     in the sense of nineteenth-century physics or chemistry, with its equally     powerful axiomatic proposition that nature and history are constituted     by the social relations of production, and that the production of the     material means of social existence is at the same time the production     of humans themselves (including their mental life). Thus, if social production     is not merely the instrument through which humans survive the vicissitudes     of their external environment but constitutes the multiplicity of their     social relations, Marxism provides the clue to a radically different conception     of scientific knowledge than is contained in its own aspirations. For,     under this axiom, not only science, but Marxism itself, must be comprehended     within the framework of social relations. Both its axiomatic and its theoretical     structures must be understood as aspects of prevailing relations of production.     In this regard, the referent of scientific knowledge, is not only the     object of investigation or, as in recently discovered quantum mechanics,     the observer, but also the social matrix within which modes of thought     are constituted. That most of the leading theorists of science and technology     in the Marxist perspective have been unable to situate their own \"paradigm\"     reflexively, that is, to understand the extent to which Marxist science     contains ideological elements or, at the very least, is dependent upon     the character of those relations that constitute it, attests to the power     of the enlightenment faith that nature (and human nature) may be comprehended     directly. As I shall show in Part 11, on neo-Marxist science and Soviet     science, even when they acknowledge the social constitution of scientific     facts, the historical relativity of scientific knowledge is attenuated     by a strict adherence to a realist epistemology; according to which the     correspondence of Scientific propositions to the material world may be     established through experimental or mathematical proofs. There are, of     course, exceptions, but these have had little lasting influence on Marxism     as an intellectual movement.          One may notice striking commensurabilities     with this development in the non-Marxist historiography, sociology, and     philosophy of sci-          32          ence as well as among scientists themselves, especially those who are     also philosophers. To acknowledge that the production of knowledge is     a social process has not been commonplace in discourses on science; however,     since Kuhn, the idea is becoming more respectable. Yet, of the major movements     of thought originating in the nineteenth century, only Marxism can account     theoretically for this development (the exceptions, poststructuralist     philosophy and historiography and the sociology of knowledge, are in fundamental     respects derivative of Marxism, even if by negation). At the same time,     the countervailing tendency within Marxism toward totality bars a wholehearted     historical relativism.          Nevertheless, whereas Kuhn,     for example, alludes to social     and cultural influences on paradigm shifts in science, Marxism specifies     these in terms of economic, political, and ideological determinants. And,     it is precisely because Marx himself generates categories that make a     social analysis of science and technology possible, that Marxism, despite     its ambivalence, has produced the only coherent social theory of science,     a theory which has scandalized its opponents (for example, Karl Popper).     Only recently, however, have some working in the Marxist tradition been     willing to extend theory to the production of scientific knowledge. Others,     notably the structuralist and analytic schools, have directed their energies     to affirming Marxism 's scientificity by declaring that the social aspects     in its development are of little or no interest, except insofar as they     illuminate the degree to which Marxist propositions conform to canon of     scientific evidence and proof.          In chapters 2 and 3 I examine,     in detail, Marx's theory of science and technology. Except for comments     in letters and his notes for Capital      published as the Grundrisse,      Marx offers no separate theory of science and technology. Rather,     his theory is imbedded, almost coded, in the rich description of the labor     process developed in the first volume of Capital and in the crucial sections     on accumulation. As we shall see, Marx understands science in terms of     the domination of capital over labor. Science is subsumed under capital     in the period of the transformation of the labor process from manufacturing     to modern industrial production. Chapter 4 traces the subtle shift in     Marxist theory of science from its role in production to an epistemological     inquiry closely connected to the status of Marxism itself as a science,     and also considers the role of the productive forces in the transition     from capitalism to socialism, a preponderant concern of leading theorists     of early twentieth-century socialism, who, taking Marx literally, foresaw     that the role of science in the new social order would be even more central     than it had hitherto been in advanced capitalist societies.          33          In chapter 5, I take up the work of the Frankfurt School, which, having     taken seriously Lukacs's insistence that nature was a social category     and science ineluctably entwined with social relations, returns to the     historical focus of Marx himself. But now, the shift away from considerations     of the labor process is definitive. Rather -- like Lukacs, Horkheimer,     and Adorno -- Marcuse and Sohn-Rethel, whose theory of science is deeply     influenced by the Frankfurt critique of science, undertake an examination     of the ideological aspects of scientific assumptions and discoveries.     However, whereas Sohn-Rethel retains Lukacs's focus on the commodity form,     the Frankfurt School presupposes Marx's categories and adopts a Weberian     emphasis on forms of rationality. Chapter 6 shows how later theorists,     particularly Habermas, want to find pathways back to reason but no longer     find them through the route of science. In effect, for Habermas, science     and technology have become part of the taken-for-granted world of instrumental     reason. His is a postindustrial theory of communication that seeks to     address the problems of social relations through language. In Chapter     7 I discuss the full-throated emergence of a Marxist epistemology introduced     by Althusser through the influences of Jacques Lacan and particularly     Gaston Bachelard. I also show the affinity of this tendency with the Italian     school emanating from Galvano Della Volpe. Finally, perhaps the apogee     of this new Marxist scientism is the most recent development of analytic     Marxism, which wants to articulate Marxism with normal, positivistic scientific     method. Chapter 8 explores the history of Soviet ideology of science,     an ideology that has become official state doctrine. I show that Soviet     views of science, while ensconced in orthodox Marxist presuppositions,     parallel tendencies in non-Marxist theories of science as well.          Part III traces parallel developments     in non-Marxist discourses on science. Here, we shall see the battle joined     principally at the epistemological level, since those perspectives that     I loosely group under the tentative rubric of liberalism have no specific      social theory of economic,     political, or scientific discourse. In fact, I argue that a distinction     between Marxism and liberalism at the ideological level lies precisely     in the absence of a distinctive liberal social theory of science. Since     enlightenment ideology, especially its scientific and technological modes,     proceeds from the presuppositions of individually driven market relations,     on the one hand, and claims concerning the universality of reason, on     the other, social theory is occluded from this antinomy. At most, liberalism     appropriates conservative communitarianism as a social site. But indigenous     liberalism implies that society is constituted by individuals and that     individual choice is the foundation          34          of collective association. Thus, the sociological conception of the \"scientific     community\" as the site of scientific discovery and the court of scientific     truth. In turn, the scientific community is composed of associated individuals     united by their training and knowledge, a unity which makes possible the     determination of whether any assertion is scientifically valid.          Clearly, this conception of     the social derives from possessive individualism. There are really no     \"structures\" of social life, no relations that transcend individual determination.     More recently, Michel Foucault has advanced the idea of discursive formation     which links social groups to discourses arranged spatially. Foucault's     insistence on the inextricable link between knowledge and power suggests     that various discursive communities are also political/economic formations     and, more generally, that what counts as knowledge is entwined with domination.     Although Foucault is usually catalogued within post-Marxism, there is     no question that the referent is still historical materialism, even if     the primacy of the economic is denied.          However, there can be no returning     to the letter of historical materialist theories as they were articulated     by Marx and Engels. For as we shall see, both are imbued with the enlightenment     ideal of science as somehow resistant to the infusion of the ideologies     produced in course of the production and reproduction of capitalist social     relations. This view is attributable not only to the context in which     studies of language and discourse as sources of ideology were still in     their infancy, but also to the problems posed by evolutionist ideology.     According to this ideology, humans stand at the pinnacle of the natural     order; their unique stature is owed to their capacity to produce means     of subsistence, and thereby to produce their life. In the production of     all aspects of existence, science is the master discourse and Marxism     underscores itself as the authentic representation of mastery in the social     field, and, as metascience, in the so-called natural field as well.     At issue in this book are both     propositions and evolutionary ideology: I argue that science is a labor     process like others; that its practices constitute an intervention of a     specific kind, whose contrast with types of social and natural     interventions cannot be arranged hierarchically on a scale of truth or     adequacy; and finally that science is a discourse that narrates the world     in a special way."}, {"content": "2005-2006 Courses    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       2005-2006 Courses Quantitative Reasoning Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Natural Science I Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Natural Science II Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Conversations of the West Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 World Cultures Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Societies and the Social Sciences Fall 2005 | Spring 2006 Expressive Culture Fall 2005 | Spring 2006            Quantitative Reasoning           Quantitative  Reasoning courses are open to first-year and sophomore students.

Topics include the big bang  theory of the creation of the universe and the formation of elements  during stellar evolution; the constituents of the universe, from the  large-scale realm of the galaxies to exotic objects such as neutron  stars and black holes; the evolution of life and intelligence in the  context of the sometimes catastrophic geologic history of our planet;  and the possibilities for intelligent life in the cosmos.                 FALL 2005  V55.0203 Natural Science I: Energy and the Environment     Prof. H. Brenner (Chemistry) syllabus   Uses the principles of chemistry to analyze the environmental  implications of energy usage and policy decisions concerning energy and  the environment. Topics include the atmosphere, ozone and its  depletion, greenhouse gases, and acid rain. Case studies from the New  York City environment, such as the Hudson River, are used to focus  discussions. Finally, questions about the basis of our need for energy,  fossil fuels and their supplies, and the available alternatives are  discussed.                 FALL 2005  V55.0204 Natural Science I: Einstein's Universe     Prof. Adler (MAP) syllabus   Addresses the science and life of Einstein in the context of  20th-century physics, beginning with 19th-century ideas about light,  space, and time in order to understand why Einstein's work was so  innovative. Einstein's most influential ideas are contained in his  theories of special relativity, which reformulated conceptions of space  and time, and general relativity, which extended these ideas to  gravitation. Both these theories are explored quantitatively, together  with wide-ranging applications of these ideas, from the nuclear energy  which powers the sun to black holes and the big bang theory of the  birth of the universe.                FALL 2005  V55.0205 Natural Science I: Exploration of Light and Color      Prof. Sleator (Physics) syllabus   Color science is an interdisciplinary endeavor that incorporates both  the physics and the perception of light and color. It provides an  understanding of visual effects that dramatically enhances our  appreciation of what we see. The study of color, light, and optics has  applications to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology. We  also study the eye as both an optical and an image processing  instrument. Topics include how color is classified and measured  (colorimetry), how light is produced, how atoms and molecules affect  light, how the human retina detects light, and how lenses are used in  cameras.                FALL 2005  V55.0206 Natural Science I: From Plato to Pluto     Prof. Schucking (Physics) syllabus   Begins with the basic phenomena of astronomy: the earth and sky, the  motions of stars, sun, moon, and planets. After this introduction  considers the historical development of astronomy from antiquity to the  17th century. Concludes with the space-age exploration of the solar  system. Laboratory exercises help to familiarize students with basic  astronomical concepts.                FALL 2005  V55.0208 Natural Science I: The Human Body - The Ultimate Machine     Prof. Walker (NYU School of Medicine) syllabus   Highlights the role of mechanical principles in explaining the function  and maintenance of the human body, and the application of biomedical  engineering in devising treatments when body parts or functions fail  mechanically or biologically. From an engineering point of view, the  capabilities of the human body, are truly remarkable. The  musculoskeletal system enables the body to perform myriad movements and  functions. The cardiovascular and pulmonary systems are marvels of  fluid mechanics and transport. The various senses act as inputs to  discern and act on the external environment. The neurological system  provides the control for all activities and functions. From a  structural point of view, the human body develops and maintains itself  by the action of mechanical stimuli on complex biological systems. For  example, stresses and motions caused by body movements lead to cyclic  deformations in the cells within the tissues, producing new tissue and  activating reparative processes; and this concept applies to many other  systems in the body. Eventually some of the structures break down, a  situation for which the field of bioengineering has produced treatments  including artificial parts and organs, augments, transplants, grafts,  tissue engineered parts, and external functional aids. Supporting  topics include design methodology and guidelines on carrying out,  documenting, and presenting research. Guest speakers will present their  specialties in related areas. Student participation and continuing  assessment is emphasized.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0202 Natural Science I: The Cosmos and the Earth     Prof. Adler (MAP) syllabus   Modern scientific findings relating to major questions about the  universe and our place in it. What is the origin of the universe? How  did the elements form? Where do stars and planets come from? How did  life on Earth originate? How did intelligence develop and human beings  come to exist? Are we alone in the cosmos? Topics include the big bang  theory of the creation of the universe and the formation of elements  during stellar evolution; the constituents of the universe, from the  large-scale realm of the galaxies to exotic objects such as neutron  stars and black holes; the evolution of life and intelligence in the  context of the sometimes catastrophic geologic history of our planet;  and the possibilities for intelligent life in the cosmos.

FALL 2005 V55.0303 Natural Science II: Human Genetics      Prof. Small (Biology) syllabus   We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the  ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain  unprecedented insights into the role of heredity. Beginning with an  overview of the principles of inheritance, such as cell division and  Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern  human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new  discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how  genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene  function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science  and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as  genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and  the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse  methods that scientists employ to study heredity.

FALL 2005  V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior     Prof. Glimcher (Neural Science) syllabus   The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic  elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and  chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this  foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new  behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in  sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the  experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the  brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral  disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for  by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter  behavior and brain function.            Note : Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.                FALL 2005  V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How it Works     Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus   The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent  molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the  human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems  operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of  blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in  respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign  invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce  various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the  course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying  molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.                FALL 2005  V55.0310 Natural Science II: The Molecules of Life     Prof. Jordan (MAP) syllabus   Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new  pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those  that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of  biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical  to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional  structure that endows them with a specific function. This information  provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new  drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding,  molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure  and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the  varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to  facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular  genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is  stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug  treatments.                 FALL 2005 V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere      Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus   Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works.  This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the  global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially  crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within  the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How  did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is  life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and  the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are  humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future  within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an  exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.

SPRING 2006 V55.0305 Natural Science II: Human Origins     Prof. Disotell (Anthropology) syllabus   An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to  investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species.  This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of  different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary  relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial  Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the  use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric  humans, solving a 2,000-year-old murder mystery, the importance of  studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the  4-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.

During and since the  European Renaissance, tragedy as usually been explained as a  performance of some universal constraining reality in which humanity is  caught, or of some eternal and ubiquitous limitations by which the  human spirit is wholly bound. It is suggested that such claims have  served to make Western tragedy a \"cultural instrument\" for particular  kinds of aesthetic and political relations to different cultures. Over  the last four decades, African and Caribbean writers in particular have  turned this \"instrument\" \"back,\" writing major works that are political  and aesthetic commentaries on that Western tradition and its  impositions, as well as on their own cultures. Emphasizing this  contemporary transcultural phenomenon, Caribbean and African writings  will be set constantly against European writings, as part of an ongoing  \"conversation.\" Readings: Aeschylus' Oresteia; Job; Sophocles' Oedipus,  Antigone; Aristotle's Poetics; Rotimi's The Gods Are Not to Blame;  Bemba's Noces posthumes de Santigone (English); Nietzsche's Birth of  Tragedy; Walcott's \"What the Twilight Says\"; Euripides' Alcestis,  Bacchae; Sutherland's Edufa; Soyinka's Bacchae of Euripides; Matthew\u2019s  Passion; Shakespeare's King Lear, Othello; Carlin's Not Now, Sweet  Desdemona; Lorca's Blood Wedding; Brecht's Mother Courage; Clark's Song  of a Goat; Aidoo's Anowa; Hussein's Kinjeketile; Sofola's Wedlock of  the Gods; C\u00e9saire's A Season in the Congo.                FALL 2005 V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages          Prof. Tylus (Italian) syllabus   Reluctant Heroes and Cultures in Conflict: In much great literature,  the quest for meaning in a world that threatens to be senseless takes  on the form of an actual physical quest to the realm of the dead, to  the land of one's forefathers, or to the place of one's own death. Such  quests in turn tend to define the genre of epic. We will explore epic  poetry in the ancient world and how it was inflected by what could be  called rival claims: by women writers and characters, by a Platonism  deeply hostile to storytelling, by Christianity and Islam. As we read,  we will talk about the creation of communities within and without the  poems, and thus about literature and its relationship to religious,  social, and other cultural practices. Finally, we will discuss how  cultures and communities revise their\u2014and others'\u2014pasts in order to  create narratives conducive to present needs. How does the Hebrew Bible  revise Canaanite myths? How do the Romans rewrite works of the Greeks,  or Christians writings of the Romans? Works include Mesopotamian hymns  to Inanna; Genesis, Ruth, Mark, Luke; Homer's Iliad; poems of Sappho  and Akhmatova; selections from Plato, Augustine, Vergil's Aeneid, and  Auerbach's Mimesis; early Christian saints' lives; Sufi poetry; Dante's  Inferno; The Name of the Rose (film version).                FALL 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance         Prof. Klein (General Studies) syllabus   Argument, Violence, and Agreement in the Social Thought. Do people  assemble into tribes, city-states, principalities, nations, churches,  etc., out of fear of violence or because of some innate sociable urge?  Do they come to agreement through reason or does their \"reason\" mask  unconscious or unacknowledged capitulation to brute natural forces? Can  thinking about the nature of our reason and discourse lead us beyond  the circle of nature, or is such philosophizing simply more idealistic  covering up of the ugly predicament of humankind? Using a few trenchant  models from contemporary social theory as background, we will examine  some Western thinkers' explorations of these questions, at the same  time asking how a thinker's own civilization (with its own forms of  violence, subjugation, peace, and beauty) shapes his contribution to  the ongoing discussion. In our case this will involve examining the  very idea of \"The Renaissance\" as a rebirth of classical civilization;  and we will ask: Why \"his\" civilization? What was \"she\" doing while he  was writing? Authors: Plato, Thucydides, Epicurus, Aristotle, Tacitus,  Plutarch, Machiavelli, More, Shakespeare, Hobbes.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Manin (Politics) syllabus   An introduction to central themes of modern Western political thought  and their sources in both the Judeo-Christian tradition and ancient  Greece. Topics include: conceptions of human nature, foundations of  human society, the place of law, the notion of covenant, the sources  and nature of political authority, individuals' rights and duties.  Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Romans; Sophocles' Antigone; Thucydides'  Peloponnesian War; Plato's Republic; Aristotle's Politics; Hobbes'  Leviathan; Locke's Second Treatise on Government; Rousseau's Discourse  on the Origins of Inequality.                 FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus   \"Know yourself\" was the phrase inscribed over the entrance to the  temple of Apollo at Delphi. How did the ancient Greeks and Romans come  to know themselves and those around them\u2014as mortal men and women,  civilized or barbarian, slaves to fate or masters of their destinies,  naturally virtuous or vicious\u2014and how did Enlightenment thinkers rework  classical thought about the self? We trace the arguments of historians,  philosophers, poets, and priests in defense of their chosen paths to  self-knowledge: memory, imagination, reason, passion, taste, and  religious devotion. We ask: how do the communities we create (family,  nation, race) affect individual identity? Must we understand the past  to make sense of the present? How do philosophical ideals and literary  inventions relate to practical ideas about the truly well-lived life?  What about the unpredictable effects of love, the irrational, the  unknown, and luck? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Acts, Romans; Euripides'  Bacchae; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Symposium; Thucydides'  Peloponnesian War; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Kant's  \"What is Enlightenment?\", \"Perpetual Peace\", \"Idea for a Universal  History\"; Rousseau's Social Contract; Wollstonecraft's Vindication of  the Rights of Women; Shelley's Frankenstein.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment          Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and  the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have  important implications for society and the individual. They lead to  alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should  exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the  nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the  Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in  mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles'  Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium;  Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus;  Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise;  Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the  English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Goldwyn (French) syllabus   Focuses on voyage, discovery, errantry, and exile in key ancient and  Enlightenment texts and how these stories transformed and shaped  understanding of the world, the \"other,\" and the self. We examine the  way the Enlightenment thinkers revisited, reinterpreted, redefined,  and, at times, rejected their intellectual and cultural legacy.  Readings: Euripides' Medea; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, and Acts;  Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Swift's  Gulliver's Travels; Voltaire's Candide; Diderot's Supplement to the  Voyage of Bougainville; and Graffigny's Letters from a Peruvian Woman.                FALL 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment         Prof. Starr (English) syllabus   Important and dynamic moments in the history of the Western engagement  with concepts of the imagination. What roles does the imagination play  in religion, philosophy, and literature? What does it mean to \"imagine\"  for the writers of Hebrew scripture, for Plato, or for Descartes, Hume,  or Jane Austen? What are the limits of imagination, and what do those  limits tell us? How does imagining relate to thinking, desiring, and  knowing? Readings: Genesis, Job, Revelation; Homer's Odyssey; Plato's  Symposium and Phaedrus; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions;  Descartes' Meditations; Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding;  Swift's Gulliver's Travels, Austen's Northanger Abbey.                 FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century         Prof. Mitsis (Classics) syllabus   We will be reading, not kneeling at the shrine of, a selection of  ancient and more recent texts which, whether one likes it or not, have  set a standard of measurement for those wishing to engage in any  authentic forms of individual thinking or of moral and social  criticism. Since these texts also happen to be inescapably difficult  and complex, this course offers no reassuring thematic overviews,  dumbed-down summaries of historical contexts, or hip nods to  contemporary popular culture. What it offers instead is an opportunity  to become more practiced in the pleasures and pains of aesthetic  experience, in the rational canons of moral and political argument, and  in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude,  that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death,  or perhaps even worse, faced with eternal life. Readings from Homer,  Sophocles, Euripides, Thucydides, Plato, Lucretius, Epictetus, Hebrew  and Christian scriptures, Augustine, Mill, Marx, Nietzsche, Tolstoy,  Freud, Proust.

FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century      Prof. Patell (English) syllabus   Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is widely thought to be one of the greatest  masterpieces of American, and indeed Western, literature. This  genre-defying book mixes comic, tragic, and epic modes as it wrestles  with questions about the relationship between free will and fate that  have tantalized humankind from antiquity to the present. By studying  Melville's engagement with his classical and biblical inheritances, we  seek to understand the sources of the cosmopolitan vision from which  his novel springs. If Moby-Dick is \"the Great American Novel,\" then  what does that tell us about the nature of \"America\"? From what kind of  \"America\" does Moby-Dick arise, and how different is that \"America\"  from the one that the novel seeks to promote? In addition to Moby-Dick,  readings include Kriwaczek's In Search of Zarathustra, selections from  the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, Sophocles' Oedipus, Vergil's  Aeneid, Shakespeare's Hamlet and King Lear, selections from Emerson and  Nietzsche, George Lakoff's Moral Politics.           Note :  Offered in conjunction with the residential education Explorations  program and open to freshmen only. Selected recitation sections are  reserved for students in the residence hall living-learning community  for the course. Students in the remaining recitations need not live in  the residence hall but are also welcome to take part in the  Explorations co-curricular activities, such as museum outings, walking  tours, and trips to the theater and opera. These events are designed to  extend conversations about the course beyond the classroom into the  city beyond.                FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century          Prof. Calhoun (Sociology) syllabus   A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with  special attention to the nature of the person, faith, ethics, and the  social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people  understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical  context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes  introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1  Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's  Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions;  Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On  Liberty; Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear  and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant  Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and  Punishment.                FALL 2005 V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century     Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus   A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the  dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical  progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and  society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the  former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught.

Fleming (History) syllabus   Aims to familiarize students with the origins and recurrence of central  themes and problems in Western culture, specifically with the so-called  \"Judeo-Christian\" and Hellenic traditions--the two traditions  underpinning Western cultural development from classical antiquity  on--and the reinterpretation, reception, and, in some instances,  rejection of those traditions during the Middle Ages. Special attention  is given to the textual genres that characterized these two periods.  Texts of antiquity include the Hebrew Bible, Plato's Republic,  Sophoclean tragedies, and Homer's Iliad. Medieval texts include  readings from Chaucer, Boccaccio, Dante, and the Thousand and One  Nights. Provides a historical and social context for the texts under  consideration and an assessment of the ways in which Medieval thinkers  attempted to reconcile their own unique historical circumstances with  the legacy of the classical Judeo-Christian and Hellenic traditions.  Consideration is also given to the questions: What do we mean when we  refer to \"the West\"? Why are the \"Middle Ages\" called the \"Middle\" ages?                 SPRING 2006 V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages     Prof. Momma (English) syllabus   Introduces students to major texts from antiquity (including Hebrew and  Christian scriptures, the writings of Plato, Greek tragedy, ancient  epic, and Augustine's Confessions) and compares these with counterparts  in the Middle Ages (such as Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, the  Old English heroic poem Beowulf, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes's Arthurian Romance  Lancelot, Dante's Divine Comedy). Consider how medieval Europe  resembles or differs from the ancient Mediterranean world, and how  these varied cultures constitute the foundation of the West as we know  it. Topics include literature and performance, different genres of  writing, transmission of knowledge, the idea of human, and ethics  manifested in different belief systems.                SPRING 2006 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Gilman (English) syllabus   The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the  \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it  also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece  and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of  crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the  \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at  antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture  between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant  with the past.

These are the civilizations where  writing began; and each had a significant impact on Israel, Greece,  Rome, and, eventually, the West. Egypt and Mesopotamia are compared and  contrasted for developments such as urbanism and state formation,  imperialism, religion, warfare, family life, trade and economy,  kingship, the role of men and women, literature, cosmology, and art. We  explore literature in the broadest sense, including documents that  might otherwise simply be classed as historical.                 FALL 2005 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies             Prof. Chelkowski (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   Examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies.  An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as  operative present or as historical past, that common religious base  called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or  observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature  historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the  society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200  years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978\u201379 Islamic  Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with  American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of  interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some  60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of  power in the government and of access to the political and economic  life of the country.                FALL 2005 V55.0505 World Cultures: Africa      Prof. Beidelman (Anthropology) syllabus   Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and  societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources  sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems  in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues,  the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique  system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on  African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for  translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an  African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among  the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist  interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.                FALL 2005 V55.0507 World Cultures: Japan             Prof. Vincent (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Japanese \"culture\" has been the subject of endless theorizing by  ideologues both inside and outside Japan. As the only non-western  nation seriously to challenge the military and economic hegemony of the  West, Japan has always both demanded and resisted explanation. The  result is a bizarre mess of contradictions: Japan is alternately  depicted as a place where history either stands still in a past steeped  with \"tradition\" or accelerated into a postmodern dystopia. Students  are introduced to the study of culture and modernity through an  examination of Japan's experience over the past two centuries. Topics  include the conversion of people into populations and of place into  abstract space, the rise of nationalism and colonialism, the invention  of translation, and the rise of the \"individual.\" Readings include  literary and polemical texts that give an understanding both of the  massive changes wrought by the advent of modernity in Japan and how  those changes were understood, narrated, and politicized.                FALL 2005 V55.0509 World Cultures: The Caribbean             Prof. Khan (Anthropology) syllabus   Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history through  race, class, culture, gender, and attending to the diversity of peoples  who live on the islands. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and  mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's  global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history  of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive  transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four  centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable  influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history  of the regions differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial  economic and political structures; anthropological material on family  and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and  ideologies; and ways in which national, ethnic, and racial identities  are expressed today.                 FALL 2005 V55.0509 World Cultures: The Caribbean             Prof. Aching (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus   The Caribbean and Revolutionary Thought: Examines the Caribbean in four  units as a site where radical challenges to and within Western thought  have emerged. Begins with the 16th-century theological problem of how  to explain the existence of the American continent when these lands  were unaccounted for in the Scriptures and the debate in the Spanish  court and universities on whether the \"Indian\" possessed a soul. The  second focus is on the enigmas of freedom during the Haitian Revolution  (1791\u20131804), when slaves defeated Napoleon's army, thereby creating the  world's only successful slave rebellion and the second independent  nation-state in the hemisphere. Third, we consider the Cuban Socialist  Revolution (1959) through an interrogation of the relationship between  man and society that Fidel Castro and Che Guevara advocated. Finally,  we ask whether the Caribbean is currently undergoing a revolution based  on invigorated, neoliberal economics. Here, the focus is on Jamaica and  its long traditions of both participating in and resisting the world  economy. Materials for analysis include political speeches, films, and  song lyrics.                 FALL 2005 V55.0510 World Cultures: Russia between East and West             Prof. Kotsonis (History) syllabus   Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and  issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including  literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements  from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of  competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural  identity.                FALL 2005 V55.0511 World Cultures: Middle Eastern Societies              Prof. Fahmy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   The histories, societies, and cultures of \"the Middle East\"\u2014a  relatively recent name for a very diverse region of western Asia and  northern Africa. Focusing on the period from the heyday of Ottoman  power in Europe and the Middle East in the sixteenth century until the  present, we use a range of materials, including translated texts,  novels and short stories, films and videos, and photographs, to explore  changing forms of individual and collective identity, patterns of  social life, and modes of government. We pay special attention to how  people in the region experienced and grappled with the profound  transformations their societies underwent from the eighteenth century  onward, especially the expansion of European economic, political, and  cultural power; colonial rule; and the rise of new nation-states. We  conclude by discussing the Middle East today and some of the issues its  peoples face.                FALL 2005 V55.0512 World Cultures: China             Prof. Waley-Cohen (History) syllabus   Major themes of Chinese culture and civilization ranging from antiquity  to the early twentieth century. Topics include art and politics,  loyalty and dissent, women and gender, social organization, the  civil/military relationship, unification and fragmentation, foreign  relations, material culture (including food), science, law, belief  systems (Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism), and the role and importance  of history. Readings focus on primary source material in translation,  including classical texts, biographies, memoirs, government documents,  novels, poetry, and other personal and private writings.                FALL 2005 V55.0512 World Cultures: China             Prof. Ben-Dor (History) syllabus   China, Ancient and Imperial: A cultural history of traditional China  from some of the earliest historical records (about 1200 B.C.E.) up  through the late imperial period (about 1800 C.E.). Covers major  historical events, developments, and trends: social, political,  economic, military, philosophical, literary, and cultural. Primary  sources (read in translation) are the main focus. These include some of  the most important writings from the Chinese tradition\u2014bone  inscriptions (used for divination), early Chinese philosophy and  thought, dynastic histories, historical biographies, novels, satires,  poetry, songs, ritual manuals, diaries, scientific treatises,  philological studies, political debates, and erotic literature\u2014as well  as some Chinese television adaptations of historical novels. Takes an  interdisciplinary approach, integrating history with literary studies,  philosophy, sociology, and anthropology, in order to understand these  works in their historical context. Emphasizes the various textual  traditions that emerged in China\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism\u2014and  how knowledge was communicated, transmitted, preserved, and developed  in China and its vicinity (mainly Japan, Korea, and Vietnam).                 FALL 2005 V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel             Prof. D. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an  ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual  state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel,  when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older  origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of  reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing  projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts.                 FALL 2005 V55.0515 World Cultures: Latin America             Prof. Y\u00fadice (American Studies) syllabus   Explores the cultural, social, and political organization of indigenous  people before the period of European colonization. Studies the dynamics  of the colonial encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous  responses to European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development, and  the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow us to hear diverse voices within Latin American  society, including works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves.  Course materials also include novels, short stories, films,  photographs, and music.                FALL 2005 V55.0516 World Cultures: India             Prof. Rajagopal (Culture &amp; Communication) syllabus   By examining representations of the Indian diaspora in the United  States, the United Kingdom, and the Caribbean, we see that a fixed idea  of \"India\" is misleading in the effort to understand its changing  manifestations. We investigate the ways in which colonialism reshaped  indigenous society, as well as the currents of religious, cultural, and  political change that developed in the process, leading to Indian  nationalism and its contemporary variations.                SPRING 2006 V55.0500 World Cultures: Nations and Nationalism - Islam, Jews and the West     Prof. Berenson (History) syllabus   Considers problems of nationalism and national identity in the modern  world: what a nation is, how nations came to be, what historical  experiences particular nations have undergone, and what forms of  nationalism their peoples have displayed. In pursuing these objectives,  we examine different theories of nationalism and then look in detail at  four case studies, each representing a different form of nationalism:  1) The rise of Arab nations and nationalism amid the collapse  empire\u2014Ottoman, British, and French (1914-58); the extreme racist  nationalism epitomized by Nazi Germany (1918-45); the nationalism of  the movement for national liberation in Algeria (1954-62); and the  rival religion-tinged nationalisms of Jews and Arabs, Israelis and  Palestinians, since 1917. We conclude with some reflections on the  persistence of nationalism in our globalized world.

Through readings of  primary texts in translation, we examine and problematize prevalent  images of Islam and engage with various facets of the tradition. Often  perceived as monolithic, Islamic discourse provides a range of symbols,  concepts, and practices that have been appropriated and re-interpreted  in many ways in different historical and cultural contexts. We survey  many of the most influential trends in Islamic thought and practice  (including Islamic law, ritual, and mysticism) and trace the ways in  which they have been redefined and transformed in changing  circumstances.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies     Prof. Gilsenan (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   One of the most widespread and fastest-growing religious traditions in  the contemporary world, Islam attracts a disproportionate share of  media attention, much of it negative and distorted. Through readings of  primary texts in translation, we examine and problematize prevalent  images of Islam and engage with various facets of the tradition.

SPRING 2006 V55.0505 World Cultures: Africa      Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature) syllabus   Key concepts for understanding sub-Saharan African cultures and  societies, and ways of thinking critically and consulting sources  sensibly when studying non-Western cultures. Topics include: problems  in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues,  the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique  system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on  African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for  translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an  African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among  the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist  interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.                SPRING 2006 V55.0506 World Cultures: The Chinese and Japanese Traditions     Prof. Roberts (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Essential aspects of Asian culture\u2014Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and  Shintoism\u2014studied through careful reading of major works of philosophy  and literature. A roughly equal division between Chinese and Japanese  works is meant to give a basic understanding of the broad similarities  and the less obvious, but all-important, differences among the cultures  of Confucian Asia. One reading is a Vietnamese adaptation of a Chinese  legend. The last two readings, modern novellas from Japan and China,  show the reaction of the traditional cultures to the Western invasions.                SPRING 2006 V55.0510 World Cultures: Russia Between East and West     Prof. Borenstein (Russian &amp; Slavic Studies) syllabus   What is Russia? What does it mean to be \"Russian\"? These questions have  troubled Russians for centuries. Certainly, most nations engage in such  soul-searching at one time or another; but Russia, thanks to special  historical circumstances, has been obsessed with the problem of its own  identity. Central to this concern is an issue that would appear to be  more geographical than cultural: Is Russia a part of Europe (the West),  or of Asia (the East)? Or, is it some hybrid that must find its own  unique destiny? As we trace the development of this problem throughout  Russia's history, we also become acquainted with the major  characteristics and achievements of Russian culture, from its very  beginnings to the present day.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0512 World Cultures: China     Prof. Guthrie (Sociology) syllabus   The most populous nation on earth, China plays a crucial role in the  world economy. An understanding of China's place in the world must  begin with its modern history\u2014from the Qing Dynasty and the Western  encroachment to the recent economic reforms of the People's Republic.  Structured not as a historical chronology, but as a sampling of  approaches to Chinese society from various analytical perspectives, in  the first half we consider some of the major events, issues, and themes  that have shaped modern Chinese society, focusing on the period from  the Opium War to the present. Through various social-scientific lenses,  we examine issues of war, political upheaval and crisis, social  movements, and the structure of communist society. In the second half  we focus on modern-day Chinese society, examining the current state of  the economic reforms, human rights, and prospects for democratization.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0515 World Cultures: Latin America     Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology) syllabus   Explores the wonderful, magical, sometimes nightmarish world of Latin  America through the past and present doings of its persons, and their  representations, religious manifestations, song, dance, and literature.  Aims both to uncover the roots of Latin-Americanness in the historical  confluence of Europe, Africa, and America, and to discover how those  roots are continually remade as each generation strives to rise from  the ashes of its forebears. Case studies include the samba schools and  Candomble religion in Brazilian carnival, the role of Vodou in the  Haitian revolution and in New York City, the Mexican burlesques of  death in the Day of the Dead, and \"Indian\" saints whose processions are  associated with rites to underworld beings as well as to national  integration. At base, the course seeks to answer more fundamental  questions: What does it mean to have an identity, Latin American or  Gringo, White, Black, Indian, or Mixed? How are the collectivities  called nations, ethnicities, races, and classes brought into being and  sustained? How is the vanished past resuscitated to serve the needs of  the present? What does it mean to be Latin American in the age of  so-called globalization?                SPRING 2006 V55.0516 World Cultures: India     Prof. Goswami (History) syllabus   Introduces students to the society, culture, and economy of modern  India, from the foundation of British colonial rule in the late 18th  century to the nationalist struggle in the early 20th century, through  the lens of broader issues in historical and cultural inquiry. Examines  shifts in society and culture during the modern period from different  perspectives: British colonial agents, religious groups, the middle and  educated classes, women and peasants, and the many-faceted struggle for  independence before and during the period of Gandhi. Secondary sources  are read in conjunction with primary sources (political treatises,  novels, and film) that speak to the more general issues at hand:  colonial domination, the relationship between cultural and economic  shifts, political identities and nationalism, and collective memory and  violence.                SPRING 2006 V55.0529 World Cultures: Contemporary Latino Cultures     Prof. Mu\u00f1oz (Performance Studies) syllabus   Examines the growth and development of Latino as a distinct category of  identity out of the highly diverse populations of Latin American  background in the U.S., paying particular attention to the social  processes shaping its emergence. Provides a detailed examination of the  processes of cultural creation behind the rising growth of  transnational cultures and identities worldwide, and of the forces that  are fueling their development. We start by exploring the immigration of  Latin American peoples to U.S. cities, turn to three case studies of  emerging Latino communities, and end by examining contemporary issues  involving Latinos in urban centers, such as New York.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0536 World Cultures: Indigenous Australia     Prof. Myers (Anthropology) syllabus   The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of  interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations  of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered  into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or  positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in  feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in  New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with  their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal  people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in  their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy  and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical  range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through  ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media,  and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and  constructed.                SPRING 2006 V55.0537 World Cultures: Modern Israel      Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and  population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To  understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the  different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150  years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population  (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special  role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew  speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the  peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday  life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on  whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens.  Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are  touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the  impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight.           top of page      Societies and the Social Sciences             FALL 2005 V55.0631 Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Metropolitan Studies             Prof. N.

How have social scientists conceptualized law? What  social processes shape the formulation of law and its application to  particular cases? What role does law play in the functioning of  society? How is law implicated in social change? What issues arise when  law is used in efforts to overcome disadvantages associated with class,  race, sex, and sexual orientation?                SPRING 2006 V55.0631 Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Metropolitan Studies     Prof. Molotch (Sociology) syllabus   Considers the major approaches that have been deployed to investigate  the urban experience in the modern world and explores the historical  geography of capitalist urbanization with particular attention to North  American and Western European cities, colonial and postcolonial cities,  and the global contexts of urban development. Major topics include:  urban and regional planning, urban politics and governance,  suburbanization and regional development, gentrification and urban  social movements, the gendering and radicalization of urban space,  racial segregation, and urban design and architecture.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0640 Societies and the Social Sciences: Anthropological Perspectives     Prof. Himpele (Anthropology) syllabus   Anthropology concerns the ways in which people live in society,  especially as mediated through cultural processes. Concerned with  non-Western as well as Western ways of life and the relations between  them, it addresses the problem of difference and similarity within and  between human populations, including the use of difference to establish  or resist power within social formations. Students explore how  anthropologists use data to develop basic premises about the nature of  human societies and the foundations of distinctive regimes of  sociality, and they examine theories of social life in terms of a  commitment to grasping the perspectives, knowledge, and  lived-experience of social actors through the methodology of  ethnographic fieldwork.                SPRING 2006 V55.0660 Societies and the Social Sciences: Linguistic Perspectives      Prof. Baltin (Linguistics) syllabus   Examines language from a dual perspective: as part of mankind's  biological endowment and as a social phenomenon. Considers the  structure, universality, and diversity of human language. Introduces  the core areas of grammar: its sound system, the structures of words  and sentences, and meanings. Examines the representation of language in  the brain, first language acquisition, and processing. Introduces  linguistic universals, dialect, sociolects, and the mechanism of  linguistic change.                SPRING 2006 V55.0690 Societies and the Social Sciences: Sociological Perspectives on the Social Foundations of Public Issues     Prof. Jackson (Sociology) syllabus   Controversial issues such as abortion, welfare, the death penalty, and  affirmative action force everyone to choose sides. Students will learn  how responsible citizens can use social science and they will learn the  key assumptions and viewpoints guiding work in the various social  sciences. The class uses an innovative approach that lets you learn how  to work in groups: You have been hired as a consultant for a candidate  running for president. Working with a team of other consultants, you  have to prepare position papers that recommend ways to resolve public  disputes over divisive social issues. You have to research each issue's  history, how other countries have responded, what explains which side  people take, which \"facts\" used by advocates are true and which are  false, and what we can predict about the effects of alternative  policies. Your group has to decide how to conduct research and then  integrate your results and ideas into a joint paper. For each of the  four main issues, you will work with a different group of people. Along  with the usual library work, you will do research over the Internet,  and all position papers and commentaries will be exchanged on the class  website. The learning experience is intensive, social, and  self-directed, and challenges you to ground your beliefs and opinions  in realistic findings and theories derived from social research.

Is there a literary language that  works differently from ordinary language? What is literary style and  form? What is the position of the writer or artist in relation to  society, and what is the function of the reader? Is literature a mirror  of the world that it describes, an attempt to influence a reader's  ideas or opinions, an expression of the identity of the writer, or none  of these?                FALL 2005 V55.0720 Expressive Culture: Images     Prof. Silver (Fine Arts) syllabus   What is the place of art in an image-saturated world? We begin by  considering the power and taboo of images and the ways in which  individuals and institutions that constitute \"the art world\" classify  some of these images as works of art, turn to explore the visual and  conceptual challenges presented by major works of sculpture,  architecture, and painting, and conclude with a selection of problems  raised by art today. Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate  and question the artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and  times.

Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures  with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both  to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century  architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper  and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.                FALL 2005 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Moreno (Music) syllabus   Contemporary everyday soundscapes are saturated with sound. To some,  there is a sense of dread: music's ubiquity\u2014a sonic cacophony of  sorts\u2014might render it banal and incapable of offering little more than  superficial amusement or serving as a convenient social lubricant. To  others, music's presence confirms its status as a fundamental aspect of  human experience. We explore in a variety of ways how, why, where, and  when we make sense of music: music and/as the everyday, music and/in  the culture industry, music and/as cultural policy; music and/as  technology, music and/as identification (generational, gendered,  racial, sub-cultural, planetary, national, regional, local), music  and/as the body. Our exploration critically examines the notion of  \"expressive culture\" and engages musical forms from wide geo-cultural  spheres and historical moments. We strive to develop creative  strategies for listening through these musical forms and build a basic  vocabulary to communicate our musical impressions.                FALL 2005 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds         Prof. Ochoa-Gautier (Music) syllabus   Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We  encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons;  they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the  movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a  series of specific case studies we investigate the function and  significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic  questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and  evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical  locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural  explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time  and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.                FALL 2005 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film     Prof. Simon (Cinema Studies) syllabus   American narrative films, produced primarily during the period 1965-75,  considered as an innovative cycle of filmmaking in dialogue with  significant historical, political, and cultural transformations in  American society. Examines developments in film genre during this  period especially in relation to political and cultural change.  Narrative innovations are emphasized, with special attention to the  specificity of film form and style (e.g., editing, mise-en-sc\u00e8ne,  sound). Provides an introduction to the methods and principles of film  analysis as well as dealing with this period of filmmaking in depth.  Includes films by Kubrick, Coppola, Altman, and Scorsese.

Meets once a  week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group  excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are  exhibited.                SPRING 2006 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds     Prof. Cusick (Music) syllabus   How do human beings use sound-based cultural behaviors to negotiate,  explore, resist, sustain, or transform our sense of selfhood, identity,  and subjectivity? To explore this question, we focus on some ways that  sound-based \"expressive cultures\"\u2014especially musical ones\u2014have served  as a means for negotiating a range of sexualities and gendered  subjectivities. We examine \"queer\" or \"feminist\" issues in 20th-century  North American music from blues to disco; from queercore to musical  responses to the AIDS epidemic; from \"the problem of women composers\"  to the late-century phenomenon of a distinctively \"queer\" music  scholarship; from the musical practices of contemporary drag kings and  queens to historicized models of cross-dressing in the Western  traditions of opera and musical theatre; and from musicals as  projecting mythic ideals of gender, race, and nation to musicals as a  genre especially appealing to people with non-normative subjectivities.                SPRING 2006 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds     Prof. Roesner (Music) syllabus   The Arts of Music. People have not only developed modes of thought,  systems of belief, and diverse ways to organize themselves collectively  into societies and cultures; in all cultures and traditions they have  also engaged in creative activity of a more specifically aesthetic  nature\u2014they have expressed themselves through art. One of the most  potent modes of artistic expression is through music, a medium  cultivated in one way or another by every human society. We examine and  compare the nature, purposes, and social functions of three different  forms of musical expression\u2014music informed by a Platonic/Pythagorean  aesthetic, Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, and jazz to c.  1950\u2014raising fundamental issues about the nature and interpretation of  music while developing a basic formal, critical, and historical  vocabulary for discussion, and, directly and indirectly, relating this  discussion to an appraisal of the state of the arts today. While  devoting a considerable amount of attention to European art music from  the middle ages to the end of the twentieth century, and to three  repertories that are considered \"classical\" in most respects, we also  draw on the whole range of musics in the world today\u2014classical,  popular, and non-Western musics in all their diversities\u2014and students  are encouraged to introduce the music with which they themselves are  most familiar into the discussion where appropriate.                 SPRING 2006 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds     Prof. Stanyek (Music) syllabus   Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music.

SPRING 2006 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film      Prof. Polan (Cinema Studies) syllabus   As the U.S. moved in the 1940s from a war-time experience to a new,  postwar context, works of popular culture expressed both the hopes and  fears that came with that transition. For example, a series of postwar  films such as the well-known It's a Wonderful Life used magic figures  who descended to earth to help lost and bedraggled protagonists find  their way again in the confusions of the moment. But the way in which  George Bailey's American dream so quickly can become a nightmare  suggests an underside to 1940s optimism. In this respect, film noir, a  trend of films that started during the war but really exploded in the  postwar era, expresses a bleaker, more bitter and downbeat vision of  the historical moment. Here, heroes turn into confused losers or loners  caught in the labyrinths and dead ends of the city. Noir expresses  tensions around urban life, around sexual roles and identity, around  work and success, and so on. We examine noir both thematically and  stylistically to pinpoint its expressive commentary on social trends  and tensions, and attend to the ongoing fascination with--and frequent  revival of--noir style and subject-matter to study how the social  concerns of film noir continue to express complications in the success  story of America as a nation.      top of page              Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "2004-2005 Courses    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       2004-2005 Courses Quantitative Reasoning Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Natural Science I Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Natural Science II Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Conversations of the West Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      World Cultures Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Societies and the Social Sciences Fall 2004 | Spring 2005      Expressive Culture Fall 2004 | Spring 2005       Quantitative Reasoning           Quantitative  Reasoning courses are open to first-year and sophomore students.

Einstein's most influential ideas are contained in his  theories of special relativity, which reformulated conceptions of space  and time, and general relativity, which extended these ideas to  gravitation. Both these theories are explored quantitatively, together  with wide-ranging applications of these ideas, from the nuclear energy  which powers the sun to black holes and the big bang theory of the  birth of the universe.                FALL 2004  V55.0205 Natural Science I: Exploration of Light and Color                   Prof. Sleator (Physics) syllabus   Color science is an interdisciplinary endeavor that incorporates both  the physics and the perception of light and color. It provides an  understanding of visual effects that dramatically enhances our  appreciation of what we see. The study of color, light, and optics has  applications to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology. We  also study the eye as both an optical and an image processing  instrument. Topics include how color is classified and measured  (colorimetry), how light is produced, how atoms and molecules affect  light, how the human retina detects light, and how lenses are used in  cameras.                FALL 2004  V55.0206 Natural Science I: From Plato to Pluto                        Prof. Schucking (Physics) syllabus   Begins with the basic phenomena of astronomy: the earth and sky, the  motions of stars, sun, moon, and planets.

FALL 2004  V55.0208 Natural Science I: The Human Body - The Ultimate Machine                   Prof. Walker (NYU School of Medicine) syllabus   Highlights the role of mechanical principles in explaining the function  and maintenance of the human body, and the application of biomedical  engineering in devising treatments when body parts or functions fail  mechanically or biologically. From an engineering point of view, the  capabilities of the human body, are truly remarkable. The  musculoskeletal system enables the body to perform myriad movements and  functions. The cardiovascular and pulmonary systems are marvels of  fluid mechanics and transport. The various senses act as inputs to  discern and act on the external environment. The neurological system  provides the control for all activities and functions. From a  structural point of view, the human body develops and maintains itself  by the action of mechanical stimuli on complex biological systems. For  example, stresses and motions caused by body movements lead to cyclic  deformations in the cells within the tissues, producing new tissue and  activating reparative processes; and this concept applies to many other  systems in the body. Eventually some of the structures break down, a  situation for which the field of bioengineering has produced treatments  including artificial parts and organs, augments, transplants, grafts,  tissue engineered parts, and external functional aids. Supporting  topics include design methodology and guidelines on carrying out,  documenting, and presenting research. Guest speakers will present their  specialties in related areas. Student participation and continuing  assessment is emphasized.

SPRING 2005 V55.0207 Natural Science I: Systems of the Human Body          Prof. Brandt (Physics) syllabus   Develops the physics necessary to understanding the various  interrelated systems operating within the human body. The  skeletal-muscle system converts muscle contraction into human motion  (the science of biomechanics is relevant here). The cardiovascular  system transports blood throughout the body, carrying oxygen to the  site of muscle contractions and removing carbon dioxide and heat (fluid  dynamics). The consumed oxygen is converted into work and heat, and the  rate of oxygen consumption varies with speed in walking, running, etc.  (thermodynamics). The nervous system transports electrical signals from  the sensory perceptors to the brain and from there to the muscles;  these signals determine human reaction time, coordination, and optimal  strategies for human performance (electrodynamics and optimal control  theory). All of these systems, working together, make possible human  motion and thought.           top of page      Natural Science II           The  prerequisite for all Natural Science II courses is completion of or  exemption from Quantitative Reasoning, or completion of an approved  substitute course.

Beginning with an  overview of the principles of inheritance, such as cell division and  Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern  human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new  discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how  genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene  function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science  and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as  genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and  the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse  methods that scientists employ to study heredity.                FALL 2004  V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior                   Prof. Glimcher (Neural Science) syllabus   The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic  elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and  chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this  foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new  behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in  sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the  experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the  brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral  disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for  by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter  behavior and brain function.           Note : Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.                FALL 2004  V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How it Works                   Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus   The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent  molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the  human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems  operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of  blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in  respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign  invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce  various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the  course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying  molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.                FALL 2004  V55.0310 Natural Science II: The Molecules of Life                   Prof. Jordan (MAP) syllabus   Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new  pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those  that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of  biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical  to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional  structure that endows them with a specific function. This information  provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new  drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding,  molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure  and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the  varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to  facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular  genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is  stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug  treatments.                FALL 2004  V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere                   Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus   Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works.  This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the  global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially  crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within  the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How  did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is  life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and  the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are  humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future  within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an  exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0303 Natural Science II: Human Genetics          Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus   We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the  ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain  unprecedented insights into the role of heredity. Beginning with an  overview of the principles of inheritance, such as cell division and  Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern  human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new  discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how  genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene  function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science  and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as  genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and  the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse  methods that scientists employ to study heredity.                SPRING 2005 V55.0305 Natural Science II: Human Origins      Prof. Disotell (Anthropology) syllabus   An introduction to the approaches and methods scientists use to  investigate the origins and evolutionary history of our own species.  This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of  different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary  relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial  Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the  use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric  humans, solving a 2,000-year-old murder mystery, the importance of  studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the  4-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.                SPRING 2005 V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior          Prof. Hawken (Neural Science) syllabus   The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic  elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and  chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this  foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new  behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in  sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the  experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the  brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral  disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for  by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter  behavior and brain function.           Note : Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.

SPRING 2005 V55.0312 Natural Science II: Earth, Life, and Time          Prof. Rampino (Biology) syllabus   Over the last four billion years, life on Earth has evolved in response  to changes in the environment. At the same time, major innovations in  the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical  environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship  between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on  the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context  for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming,  tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.           top of page      Conversations of the West                 FALL 2004 V55.0400 Conversations of the West: Topics in Antiquity and Modernity - Science, Literature, and the Imagination               Prof. Freccero (Italian) syllabus   In modernity, the development of scientific investigation has  accustomed us to thinking of literature and science as widely divergent  activities, despite instances in which they may be said to have arisen  from common sources in the imagination of the West. While scientific  activity is commonly defined in terms of experimentation and  mathematical analysis, there is a creative dimension of science which  is logically prior to these institutional activities. We are thus not  concerned with the \"influence\" of science on literature, or vice-versa,  but rather with examining the imaginative themes which writers and  scientists have in common in three revolutionary moments in the history  of the West. The first is the Copernican revolution in the early  sixteenth century, the second is what has been called the  \"Machiavellian moment,\" at about the same time. The last, one that is  still with us, is the Darwinian revolution of the nineteenth century.  Like all revolutions, however, these had their antecedents and their  posterity, extending back to antiquity and forward to our own time.  Readings: Genesis, Lucretius' On the Nature of Things, Augustine's  Confessions, Dante's Inferno and Paradiso, Italo Svevo's Confessions of  Zeno, Galileo's Starry Messenger, Darwin's Origin of Species, George  Eliot's Middlemarch, Machiavelli's Prince, Shakespeare's Richard III,  Nicholas of Cusa's Learned Ignorance, Pico's Dignity of Man, Pope's  Essay on Man, Giordano Bruno's Ash Wednesday Supper, Gramsci's The  Modern Prince, selections from Plato, Ovid, John Donne.                FALL 2004  V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages               Prof. Ivry (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   God and/or Nature: Canonical and foundational texts in the Western  tradition that explain the world in religious and/or naturalistic  terms. The readings show that both perspectives are employed in most  works, a dialectical interplay ensuing between and within different  authors. Themes to be discussed include myths of origin and divinity,  happiness and the nature of the good, and eschatological visions.  Readings include selections from Hebrew and Christian scriptures and  the Quran, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Avicenna,  Maimonides, and Dante.                FALL 2004  V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages               Prof. Momma (English) syllabus   How has the world been presented and how have men and women who occupy  that space defined themselves through their relation to higher beings,  beasts, monsters, and, also, each other? Students will be encouraged to  discuss how modern concepts of humankind owe to, or depart from,  premodern learning and imaginations. Readings from Hebrew and Christian  scriptures, Plato, Greek tragedy, ancient epic, Beowulf, Laxdaela Saga,  Cervantes' Don Quixote; selections from the Arthurian poems by Chr\u00e9tien  de Troyes, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dante's Divine Comedy.                FALL 2004  V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance               Prof. Javitch (Comparative Literature) syllabus   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1 Corinthians; Homer's Odyssey;  Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; selections from  Ovid's Metamorphoses; Augustine's Confessions; Erasmus's Praise of  Folly; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince;  Montaigne's \"Apology for Raymond Sebond\"; Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part  I . After reading these works with care, and considering them in their  particular historical contexts, as we move from Greece to Rome, from  Hebrew and pagan culture to Christianity, and then to Renaissance  Europe, we will examine how these works imitate, modify, or challenge  their predecessors (e.g., the Aeneid and the Odyssey, the Confessions  and Greco-Roman ethics, Praise of Folly and 1 Corinthians; the Book of  the Courtier and the Symposium), and, also, how Renaissance authors  appropriate the thought and writings of antiquity to forge their own  modern views of the world.                FALL 2004  V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance               Prof. Low (English) syllabus   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Homer's Odyssey;  Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's  Apology and Symposium; Pico's Dignity of Man; Castiglione's Book of the  Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Milton's Paradise Lost. To understand  each of these works in its own terms, we set them against the history  and culture of their times. As we proceed, we find that the  civilizations of Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem contribute to a dialogue,  in which certain important themes appear and reappear, change, develop,  and sometimes reverse themselves. Over the millennia these  representative works have powerfully influenced their successors and  constitute a self-renewing tradition.

FALL 2004  V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment               Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus   \"Know yourself\" was the phrase inscribed over the entrance to the  temple of Apollo at Delphi. How did the ancient Greeks and Romans come  to know themselves and those around them\u2014as mortal men and women,  civilized or barbarian, slaves to fate or masters of their destinies,  naturally virtuous or vicious\u2014and how did Enlightenment thinkers rework  classical thought about the self? We trace the arguments of historians,  philosophers, poets, and priests in defense of their chosen paths to  self-knowledge: memory, imagination, reason, passion, taste, and  religious devotion. We ask: how do the communities we create (family,  nation, race) affect individual identity? Must we understand the past  to make sense of the present? How do philosophical ideals and literary  inventions relate to practical ideas about the truly well-lived life?  What about the unpredictable effects of love, the irrational, the  unknown, and luck? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Acts, Romans; Euripides'  Bacchae; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Symposium; Thucydides'  Peloponnesian War; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Kant's  \"What is Enlightenment?\", \"Perpetual Peace\", \"Idea for a Universal  History\"; Rousseau's Social Contract; Wollstonecraft's Vindication of  the Rights of Women; Shelley's Frankenstein.

The works we study continue to shape the way people  understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical  context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes  introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1  Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's  Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions;  Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On  Liberty; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and  Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic  and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.

Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and  Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and  Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's  Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in  Venice.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Gilman (English) syllabus   The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the  \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it  also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece  and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of  crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the  \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at  antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture  between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant  with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's  Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke,  Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the  Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's  Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest.                SPRING 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Klein (General Studies) syllabus   Argument, Violence, and Agreement in the Social Thought. Do people  assemble into tribes, city-states, principalities, nations, churches,  etc., out of fear of violence or because of some innate sociable urge?  Do they come to agreement through reason or does their \"reason\" mask  unconscious or unacknowledged capitulation to brute natural forces? Can  thinking about the nature of our reason and discourse lead us beyond  the circle of nature, or is such philosophizing simply more idealistic  covering up of the ugly predicament of humankind? Using a few trenchant  models from contemporary social theory as background, we will examine  some Western thinkers' explorations of these questions, at the same  time asking how a thinker's own civilization (with its own forms of  violence, subjugation, peace, and beauty) shapes his contribution to  the ongoing discussion. In our case this will involve examining the  very idea of \"The Renaissance\" as a rebirth of classical civilization;  and we will ask: Why \"his\" civilization? What was \"she\" doing while he  was writing? Authors: Plato, Thucydides, Epicurus, Aristotle, Tacitus,  Plutarch, Machiavelli, More, Shakespeare, Hobbes.                SPRING 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment      Prof. Goldwyn (French) syllabus   Focuses on voyage, discovery, errantry, and exile in key ancient and  Enlightenment texts and how these stories transformed and shaped  understanding of the world, the \"other,\" and the self. We examine the  way the Enlightenment thinkers revisited, reinterpreted, redefined,  and, at times, rejected their intellectual and cultural legacy.  Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, and Acts; Euripides' Medea;  Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Swift's  Gulliver's Travels; Voltaire's Candide; Diderot's Supplement to the  Voyage of Bougainville; and Graffigny's Letters from a Peruvian Woman.

What roles does the imagination play  in religion, philosophy, and literature? What does it mean to \"imagine\"  for the writers of Hebrew scripture, for Plato, or for Descartes, Hume,  or Jane Austen? What are the limits of imagination, and what do those  limits tell us? How does imagining relate to thinking, desiring, and  knowing? Readings: Genesis, Job, Revelation; Homer's Odyssey; Plato's  Symposium and Phaedrus; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions;  Descartes' Meditations; Hume's Treatise of Human Nature; Swift's  Gulliver's Travels; Austen's Northanger Abbey.

Since these texts also happen to be inescapably difficult  and complex, this course offers no reassuring thematic overviews,  dumbed-down summaries of historical contexts, or hip nods to  contemporary popular culture. What it offers instead is an opportunity  to become more practiced in the pleasures and pains of aesthetic  experience, in the rational canons of moral and political argument, and  in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude,  that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death,  orperhaps even worse, faced with eternal life.

An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as  operative present or as historical past, that common religious base  called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or  observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature  historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the  society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200  years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978-79 Islamic  Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with  American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of  interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some  60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of  power in the government and of access to the political and economic  life of the country.

Topics include: problems  in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues,  the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique  system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on  African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for  translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an  African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among  the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist  interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.                FALL 2004  V55.0507 World Cultures: Japan      Prof. Yoshimoto (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Examines Japanese society since the end of World War II through a study  of popular culture. Topics include: war and its aftermath, nuclear  apocalypse, the Cold War and economic recovery, consumer culture,  gender and sexuality, technology and utopianism/dystopianism, and  nostalgia for the past. The primary texts to be looked at are Japanese  animation or so-called anime. Writings on popular culture, books and  essays on history, novels and short stories, and other audio-visual  materials are used to develop critical skills in cultural analysis and  to reflect on what is or is not lost in translation of Japanese  animation.                FALL 2004  V55.0512 World Cultures: China      Prof. Guthrie (Sociology) syllabus   The most populous nation on earth, China plays a crucial role in the  world economy. An understanding of China's place in the world must  begin with its modern history\u2014from the Qing Dynasty and the Western  encroachment to the recent economic reforms of the People's Republic.  Structured not as a historical chronology, but as a sampling of  approaches to Chinese society from various analytical perspectives, the  course considers some of the major events, issues, and themes that have  shaped modern Chinese society, focusing on the period from the Opium  War to the present. Through various social-scientific lenses, we  examine issues of war, political upheaval and crisis, social movements,  the structure of communist society, and economic reform.                FALL 2004  V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel      Prof. Kawashima (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   Examines various aspects of the \"culture\" of ancient Israel from its  origins up to the Babylonian Exile (587 B.C.E.) through a close reading  and analysis of large portions of the Hebrew Bible. Focuses in  particular on Israelite religion, not just as a set of beliefs and  practices, but as a way of understanding gods, humans, the world, and  the relations among them. Topics include: myth, ritual, sacrifice, law,  and the sacred. Our method is comparative, drawing on mythic and epic  traditions of Mesopotamia, Ugarit, and Greece, in order to bring the  peculiar nature of the Hebrew Bible and biblical religion into better  focus. We address the conceptual divide between so-called \"pagan\"  religions and, for lack of a better term, the \"monotheistic\" religion  of ancient Israel. The point is not to judge the relative merits of  these two different religious systems, but to recognize and understand  their differences. Questions of historical background and literary form  (myth, epic, history) will also be taken into account.

Studies the dynamics  of the colonial encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous  responses to European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development, and  the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow us to hear diverse voices within Latin American  society, including works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves.  Course materials also include novels, short stories, films,  photographs, and music.                FALL 2004  V55.0516 World Cultures: India      Prof. Goswami (History) syllabus   Introduces students to the society, culture, and economy of modern  India, from the foundation of British colonial rule in the late 18th  century to the nationalist struggle in the early 20th century, through  the lens of broader issues in historical and cultural inquiry. Examines  shifts in society and culture during the modern period from different  perspectives: British colonial agents, religious groups, the middle and  educated classes, women and peasants, and the many-faceted struggle for  independence before and during the period of Gandhi. Secondary sources  are read in conjunction with primary sources (political treatises,  novels, and film) that speak to the more general issues at hand:  colonial domination, the relationship between cultural and economic  shifts, political identities and nationalism, and collective memory and  violence.                FALL 2004  V55.0523 World Cultures: Islam in Asia      Prof. McChesney (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   More Muslims live today in Central and South Asia than in the entire  Middle East. We consider the spread of the religion of Islam from the  Middle East, the nature of the ensuing dialogue between Muslimsand  adherents of existing religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, shamanism), and  the politics of Islam today in the Central Asian countries of the  former Soviet Union, and in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and  Bangladesh. The focus is on the nature of the dialogue and conflict  between the adherents of Islam and those of other religious traditions,  in order to clarify the economic and social issues behind conflicts  waged in the name of religion. Readings and films will make use of  indigenous materials and their representations of Islam in those  regions both historically and today.                FALL 2004  V55.0534 World Cultures: The Black Atlantic      Prof. Fischer (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus   The cultures of the African diaspora that resulted from the Atlantic  slave trade and the struggle against it, focusing on the political and  expressive cultures of the Black Atlantic, and asking how issues  concerning racial slavery, racial subordination, and racial liberation  affected the formation of national cultures from Enlightenment Europe  to the 20th century Caribbean and the United States. Special attention  will be paid to the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804), the only successful  slave revolution in Western history. Readings in the historiography of  the Atlantic of the slavery and post-slavery period will be  supplemented by readings in political philosophy, anthropology, and  literature, as well as film screenings.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies      Prof. Ben-Dor (History) syllabus   Islamic culture\u2014from Spain to China, and from pre-Islamic times to the  late Ottoman period\u2014viewed through written texts, as well as music,  visual arts, and films. Topics include: poetry, the Quran, hadith,  fiction, travel and adventure literature, philosophy, law, polemical  writing, geography and historiography, science, and love. Each theme,  literary genre, or topic is examined through several examples drawn  from varying contexts and periods. While the approach is not strictly  chronological, particular attention is paid to the historical context  giving rise to the materials under consideration.                SPRING 2005 V55.0511 World Cultures: Middle Eastern Societies      Prof. Fahmy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   The histories, societies, and cultures of \"the Middle East\"\u2014a  relatively recent name for a very diverse region of western Asia and  northern Africa. Focusing on the period from the heyday of Ottoman  power in Europe and the Middle East in the sixteenth century until the  present, we use a range of materials, including translated texts,  novels and short stories, films and videos, and photographs, to explore  changing forms of individual and collective identity, patterns of  social life, and modes of government. We pay special attention to how  people in the region experienced and grappled with the profound  transformations their societies underwent from the eighteenth century  onward, especially the expansion of European economic, political, and  cultural power; colonial rule; and the rise of new nation-states. We  conclude by discussing the Middle East today and some of the issues its  peoples face.                SPRING 2005 V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel      Prof. Schiffman (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times and  the second Temple period and the emergence of classical Judaism,  covering the period from c. 1400 B.C.E. to the third century C.E.  Topics include the achievements of these societies in law and social  organization, prophetic movements, history of Israelite religion and  early Judaism, and ancient Hebrew and Jewish literature. The Hebrew  Bible and Rabbinic literature preserve much of the creativity of  ancient Israel; and archaeological excavations in Israel and  neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in  Hebrew and related languages have added to our knowledge. In addition,  new discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls contribute greatly to our  understanding of the history of Judaism and the emergence of  Christianity. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.                SPRING 2005 V55.0515 World Cultures: Latin America      Prof. Himpele (Anthropology) syllabus   Explores the cultural, social, and political organization of indigenous  people before the period of European colonization.

SPRING 2005 V55.0516 World Cultures: India      Prof. Rajagopal (Culture &amp; Communication) syllabus   By examining representations of the Indian diaspora in the United  States, the United Kingdom, and the Caribbean, we see that a fixed idea  of \"India\" is misleading in the effort to understand its changing  manifestations. We investigate the ways in which colonialism reshaped  indigenous society, as well as the currents of religious, cultural, and  political change that developed in the process, leading to Indian  nationalism and its contemporary variations.                SPRING 2005 V55.0523 World Cultures: Islam in Asia      Prof. McChesney (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   More Muslims live today in Central and South Asia than in the entire  Middle East.

Cohen (Russian &amp; Slavic Studies) syllabus   Major periods, developments, and interpretative issues in Russian  politics, history, and society, from the 1917 revolution to the  present. The emphasis is on the Soviet experience, though the Tsarist  past and post-Soviet developments are also considered. Special  attention is given to the role of historical traditions, leadership,  ideology, ramifying events, and socioeconomic factors.                SPRING 2005 V55.0532 World Cultures: The African Diaspora      Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus   The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time,  examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of  special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering  on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of  cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to  non-African influences.                SPRING 2005 V55.0535 World Cultures: Korea and Korean Diaspora      Prof. Park (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Modern Korean history is characterized by a volatile transformation of  the nation: the national division into South and North Koreas and their  ideologically skewed relations with Korean diasporic communities during  the Cold War period, and the economic and cultural integration of the  two Koreas and the Korean diaspora in the post-Cold War era. To  understand the origins and changing processes of Korean politics, our  study embeds Korean nation formation in geopolitics and global  capitalism, in three parts: the politics and cultures of decolonization  and the \"economic miracle\" in South Korea; political ideology and  economic crisis in North Korea; and the study of Korean-Chinese,  Korean-Japanese, and Korean-American diasporic communities, as well as  their relations with both North and South Korea.           top of page      Societies and the Social Sciences                 FALL 2004 V55.0600 Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics - Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Empires and Political Imagination      Prof. Burbank (History) &amp; Prof. Cooper (History) syllabus   Throughout history, most people have lived in empires. How have empires  inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging,  and power? Comparative study of empires from the Romans to the present  expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the  nation-state is \"natural\" and necessary. We explore historians' various  approaches to studying empires and investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese,  Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as  well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other  imperial polities.                FALL 2004  V55.0600 Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics - Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Human Rights and Transitional Societies      Prof. Dixon (Sociology) syllabus   Explores the development of the rule of law and human rights in  transitional societies. Particular emphasis is given to these issues in  post-Nazi Germany and post-communist Central Europe, especially the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and the former East Germany.  After a brief history of Czechoslovakia and the constitutionalization  of the \"velvet revolution,\" we examine the historical, domestic and  international context of human rights in transitional justice. To  understand the historical context, we discuss the debates that occurred  when emerging democracies dealt with former regimes during  de-Nazification and de-communization (public access to the files of the  former secret police, purging and screening, prosecution, statutes of  limitations). We also compare similar debates in transitional regimes  in Central America, South Africa, and Iraq. To study the domestic  contexts, we examine contemporary human rights debates as they relate  to citizenship and nationalism, freedom of the press, social and  economic rights, women's rights, and discrimination against the Roma  (gypsies). Finally, we explore the international context of human  rights by analyzing human rights and European Union membership, the  application of Western legal rights, the globalization of law, and  contradictions between \"local\" and \"global\" human rights.                FALL 2004  V55.0616 Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Language of America's Ethnic Minorities      Prof. Singler (Linguistics) syllabus   Examines the role of language in communities in the United States,  specifically within African-American, Asian-American, Latino, and  Native American populations. Explores the relationship of language to  culture, race, and ethnicity, looking in particular for similarities  and differences across these communities. Considers the role that  language experiences play in current models of race and ethnicity.

SPRING 2005 V55.0660 Societies and the Social Sciences: Linguistic Perspectives      Prof. Guy (Linguistics) syllabus   Examines language from a dual perspective: as part of mankind's  biological endowment and as a social phenomenon. Considers the  structure, universality, and diversity of human language. Introduces  the core areas of grammar: its sound system, the structures of words  and sentences, and meanings. Examines the representation of language in  the brain, first language acquisition, and processing. Introduces  linguistic universals, dialect, sociolects, and the mechanism of  linguistic change.

How have social scientists conceptualized law? What  social processes shape the formulation of law and its application to  particular cases? What role does law play in the functioning of  society? How is law implicated in social change? What issues arise when  law is used in efforts to overcome disadvantages associated with class,  race, sex, and sexual orientation?           top of page      Expressive Culture                 FALL 2004 V55.0720 Expressive Culture: Images      Prof. McKelway (Fine Arts)   An introduction to the visual language and functions of art from the  cultural perspective of ancient East Asia, including some  cross-cultural comparison with South Asian and European art. Strong  emphasis is given to art forms other than painting and sculpture,  including ceramics, lacquer, metalwork, and textile design, in order to  question the ways in which individuals and institutions classify and  define works of art. Students learn vocabulary to analyze and  appreciate works of art from a variety of perspectives, including  style, technology, and literary or historical context. Coincident with  a major exhibition of Chinese art at the Metropolitan Museum, \"China:  Dawn of a Golden Age,\" students explore and write about actual works on  display in New York City.                FALL 2004  V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study      Prof. Broderick (Fine Arts) syllabus   New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for  firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban  architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts.  Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures  with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both  to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century  architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper  and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.                FALL 2004  V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Boorman (Music) syllabus   Music as Sound, Music as Communication. How does music works, what are  its elements, and how do they help it act as a communicative device? To  explore the various ways in which music has been used to communicate  different types of messages, we consider case studies of classical  music of the 18th and 19th centuries, music in Indonesia, music as a  vehicle for political messages, and new ideas about music itself.                FALL 2004  V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Cusick (Music)      Prof. Dujunco (Music) syllabus   Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We  encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons;  they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the  movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a  series of specific case studies we investigate the function and  significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic  questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and  evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical  locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural  explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time  and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.                FALL 2004  V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film      Prof. Allen (Cinema Studies) syllabus   Using the films of Alfred Hitchcock, we explore the representational  and expressive possibilities that cinema affords in the context of mass  culture, at the same time providing students with the concepts to grasp  the different ways in which films create meaning, achieve their  emotional impact, and respond in complex ways to the historical  contexts in which they are made. Hitchcock made 53 feature films in a  fifty-year career. Seeking recognition of the role of the film director  as the distinctive creative influence in the medium, he grafted  modernist strategies of visual symbolism and metaphor onto the  essentially conservative, masculine, patriotic and popular genre of the  espionage thriller. In this way he probed the idea of the formation of  the couple\u2014the sine qua non of popular narrative\u2014by connecting the  establishment of romance and social order to the problem of deciphering  the visual field and discovering truth in a world of mere appearances,  introducing a remarkable self-consciousness, as well as stylistic  sophistication, into works of mass culture.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0720 Expressive Culture: Images      Prof. Rice (Fine Arts) syllabus   What is the place of art in an image-saturated world? We begin by  considering the power and taboo of images and the ways in which  individuals and institutions that constitute \"the art world\" classify  some of these images as works of art, turn to explore the visual and  conceptual challenges presented by major works of sculpture,  architecture, and painting, and conclude with a selection of problems  raised by art today. Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate  and question the artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and  times.                SPRING 2005 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study      Prof. Broderick (Fine Arts) syllabus   New York's public art collections contain important examples of  painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as  some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a  week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group  excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are  exhibited.                SPRING 2005 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Roesner (Music) syllabus   The Arts of Music. People have not only developed modes of thought,  systems of belief, and diverse ways to organize themselves collectively  into societies and cultures; in all cultures and traditions they have  also engaged in creative activity of a more specifically aesthetic  nature\u2014they have expressed themselves through art. One of the most  potent modes of artistic expression is through music, a medium  cultivated in one way or another by every human society. We examine and  compare the nature, purposes, and social functions of three different  forms of musical expression\u2014music informed by a Platonic/Pythagorean  aesthetic, Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, and jazz to c.  1950\u2014raising fundamental issues about the nature and interpretation of  music while developing a basic formal, critical, and historical  vocabulary for discussion, and, directly and indirectly, relating this  discussion to an appraisal of the state of the arts today. While  devoting a considerable amount of attention to European art music from  the middle ages to the end of the twentieth century, and to three  repertories that are considered \"classical\" in most respects, we also  draw on the whole range of musics in the world today\u2014classical,  popular, and non-Western musics in all their diversities\u2014and students  are encouraged to introduce the music with which they themselves are  most familiar into the discussion where appropriate.                SPRING 2005 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Shohat (Art and Public Policy) &amp; Prof. Stam (Cinema Studies) syllabus   Multiculturalism, Race, and the Media. We will discuss film and the  media in terms of racial representation and multicultural history. On  the one hand, we will look critically at the stereotyped ways in which  race, ethnicity, and national identity have been portrayed in the mass  media; on the other, we will celebrate alternative, multicultural  representations. The films presented will range from Spike Lee's Do the  Right Thing to Battle of Algiers and Hearts and Minds and Lone Star,  alongside the stand-up comedy of Chris Rock and the media-making of  Michael Moore. We will talk about multicultural issues in France,  Brazil and India as well as the U.S. Some key issues and concepts will  be: contrapuntal history, colonial discourse, ethnicities-in-relation,  third world and minority film, aesthetics of resistance. Three key  texts for the course will be: Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, Unthinking  Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media, Sven Lindquist,  Exterminate All the Brutes, and James Loewen, Lies My Teacher Taught Me.      top of page                   Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
