In the    past decade, dramaturgy has left its theatrical confines to become increasingly more present in    different art-forms, particularly among the European avant-garde. Today, one talks of \u00b3dance    dramaturgy,\u00b2 \u00b3visual dramaturgy,\u00b2 even of a \u00b3macro-dramaturgy,\u00b2 aimed at promoting broad social    change. Although it is still questionable whether this explosion signifies real gain for the dramaturg --    or even for the art-forms he or she works with -- the return of the dramaturg to the avant-garde scene    has brought important consequences for the making and theorizing of performance. The blurring of    disciplinary and aesthetic boundaries being one of its most intringuing changes. In this course, we will    read from a broad range of contemporary dramaturgs, as well as from choreographers, filmmakers,    visual artists and theater directors in order to assess how the dramaturg fits less a specific role and is    more and more becoming a process facilitator, and how the dramaturg faces very specific tasks,    practical compositional problems and ethical dilemmas. We will view film, theater, dance,    performance art, and installation art to identify elements of composition, thematic fields, and mediaspecific    problems in dramaturgy. Throughout the semester, students will also be assigned to work as    dramaturgs in theatre, dance and performance art productions in NYC. This practical aspect of the    course will guide our work around specific problems in composition, editing, rehearsing,    choreographing and writing each of the productions will bring.
