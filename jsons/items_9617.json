FREN-UA 145 Approaches to Francophone Literature Prof. St\u00e9phane Gerson TR, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-4 #8249 The course examines the conceptualizing of Francophonie through the literature from a network of French-speaking countries which together form a Francophone space. It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq.

Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.  FREN-UA 965 (conducted in French ) Topics in French Literature: Slavery in the Francophone World Prof. C\u00e9cile Bishop MW, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-19 #8726 Between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century, France was responsible for the kidnapping, forced transport and brutal enslavement of over a million Africans. This course examines representations of slavery in a wide range of media including literature, film and visual arts, from the late 18th century to the present day. In addition to exploring the role of slavery in shaping French and francophone cultures, students will develop new perspectives on the power and limits of literature and art in representing violence and suffering. Authors studied include Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Claire de Duras, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Maryse Cond\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 Schwarz-Bart and Patrick Chamoiseau.

Adopting a chronological approach, we will explore the different stages of Paris\u2019 development through the analysis of numerous historical and literary texts, maps, paintings, photographs and movies. In the process, we will journey through over 2000 years of French history, discovering major political, social and artistic events, and developing a vision of the organic growth of the city.

One film is viewed per week and   analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and   poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media   and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these   media so often focus.

FREN-UA 145 Approaches to Francophone Literature Prof. St\u00e9phane Gerson TR, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-4 #8249 The course examines the conceptualizing of Francophonie through the literature from a network of French-speaking countries which together form a Francophone space. It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq. FREN-UA 991.002 La Politique des Images en France Prof. Ludovic Cortade TR, 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm 194 Mercer, 208 #6884 Ce s\u00e9minaire, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants \u00abSenior\u00bb, offre une m\u00e9thode pour comprendre l\u2019importance et l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence des images dans notre civilisation, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, en France. Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.  FRENCH ELECTIVES  FREN-UA 935 (conducted in French ) Women Writers in France Prof. Laura Hughes MW, 9:30am \u2013 10:45am 25 W. 4th St., C-4 #16734 Il s'agira, \u00e0 travers les si\u00e8cles et cinq romans de femme aux styles divers, de voir sous quels traits semble s'esquisser une \u00e9criture f\u00e9minine. L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.  FREN-UA 965 (conducted in French ) Topics in French Literature: Slavery in the Francophone World Prof. C\u00e9cile Bishop MW, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-19 #8726 Between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century, France was responsible for the kidnapping, forced transport and brutal enslavement of over a million Africans. This course examines representations of slavery in a wide range of media including literature, film and visual arts, from the late 18th century to the present day. In addition to exploring the role of slavery in shaping French and francophone cultures, students will develop new perspectives on the power and limits of literature and art in representing violence and suffering. Authors studied include Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Claire de Duras, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Maryse Cond\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 Schwarz-Bart and Patrick Chamoiseau. FREN-UA 865 (conducted in English ) Topics in French Culture: Paris in History, Art and Literature Prof. Olivier Berthe MW, 4:55pm \u2013 6:10pm 25 W. 4th St., C-9 #8267 The aim of this course is to help the student develop an intimate knowledge of France\u2019s capital city. Adopting a chronological approach, we will explore the different stages of Paris\u2019 development through the analysis of numerous historical and literary texts, maps, paintings, photographs and movies. In the process, we will journey through over 2000 years of French history, discovering major political, social and artistic events, and developing a vision of the organic growth of the city. (French majors must fill out a French Coursework Guarantee in order to receive credit towards their major requirements for this course.)  FREN-UA 883 (conducted in English) Cinema and Literature Prof. William Wolf W, 2:00pm \u2013 4:45pm Cantor 101 #6881 Exposes   the student to various modes, such as expressionism, social realism,   and the projection of the hero. One film is viewed per week and   analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and   poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media   and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these   media so often focus.

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.
