  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

This fellowship provided me with the necessary structure, freedom, and support to create a piece that I might not have completed otherwise\u00ad\u2014in my case, a piece of challenging, personal writing. Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

This fellowship provided me with the necessary structure, freedom, and support to create a piece that I might not have completed otherwise\u00ad\u2014in my case, a piece of challenging, personal writing. Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

Her most recent reporting project was a story about ten and eleven year old boys tried on conspiracy to murder charges in rural Washington state, for Buzzfeed Longform. David Grann described the article as \"Deeply reported, disturbing, important,\" and it was chosen as one of The New Yorker's Weekend Reads. Since graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Lit she has written for the New Republic on phone hacking and the London riots, for the Economist on Rebecca West and Greek cinema, as well as for the Guardian on Newcastle, bad literary marriages, and watching the same film every day for a year. She\u2019s also reviewed books for the Financial Times, Independent, and New York Times. For the last year she has been a research assistant to Patrick Radden Keefe, working on background for his articles about mining corruption in Guinea, marijuana legalisation in Washington and Colorado, and more recently pieces on insider trading in New York hedge funds as well as Swiss banks and offshore accounts.   Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money.   Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU.   Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again.   With roots in Washington, D.C. and Stuttgart, Germany, Natalie Lampert has traveled and written her way through thirty countries. Despite this, she still struggles using chopsticks. Natalie received her B.A. in English and International Relations from Elon University in 2011. She has worked in a variety of writing environments, including as a reporter for an Austrian newspaper, as managing editor of her college\u2019s literary journal, and as an intern at a publishing house in Sri Lanka. As a 2012-2013 Fulbright scholar in Sri Lanka, Natalie taught contemporary literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia.   Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation.   Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South.   Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again.   Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view.   Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more.   In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change.   Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil. She earned a B.S. in Studio Art at NYU and followed it up with an M.A. in History of Art at University College London. After working in the UK arts sector for several years, Cleuci made a career change into journalism. She has written for print and online publications in her native Brazil. Currently, she works for Cracked.com, both as a moderator for its Writers\u2019 Workshop and as a reporter for the more recent Personal Experience features. In the process, she has interviewed, among others, a Russian mail-order bride, the survivor of an end-times Christian cult and a woman with a neurological condition that prevents her from recognizing faces.   Maggie Whitehead spent the past four years in Baltimore, Maryland working for the International Rescue Committee as a caseworker for newly arrived refugees. While serving a wide refugee client base, she worked closely with trauma victims and wrote individual histories to secure disability status for refugees with psychosomatic conditions. Prior to refugee resettlement, she lived in Tamil Nadu with a dozen mischievous teenage boys, who taught her bad Indian manners and the convoluted nature of English phonetics. Despite years of communicating mainly with limited English speakers, Maggie hopes to regain her vocabulary and put it to use. She is eager to unite her passions for writing and advocacy at NYU, and plans to focus her work around the successes and trials of human migration.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Literary Reportage 2013   Elizabeth Flock &lt; elizabethflock@gmail.com &gt; is a journalist with a deep interest in social issues and foreign news reporting.

She grew up in Albany, NY, but spent the last four years in Amish country, earning a B.A. in religious studies at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. Her work experience has provided her insight into the dynamics of bagging groceries, teaching mono-skiing, selling cigars, changing diapers, providing emergency medical support, catering dinner parties and interacting with the elderly. On her own time she often reads, fluctuating between feeling enamored and dejected by the plethora of perfect sentences and stories already in existence. At NYU, she plans to write about what she loves: American spirituality as it manifests within a modern, metropolitan setting. You can find her work at www.outsideden.wordpress.com   Alistair Mackay &lt; aldmackay@gmail.com &gt; is a writer with roots in London and Sydney.

During college, she was an opinion columnist for the Minnesota Daily and completed a book-length thesis examining the intricacies of the coffee supply chain. Using grants, she met coffee producers along the Guatemalan-Mexican border, picked and processed coffee by hand, and witnessed the enthusiasm of traders and graders. Inspired by her undergraduate research and her life in Guatemala, Kelsey plans to focus her writing on issues of immigration while at NYU. When she isn\u2019t writing or grading papers, she does her crosswords in black ink, and enjoys salsa dancing, the smell of fall air, and a good cup of sustainably grown coffee.

He is online @ Seanpatrickcooper.com Michelle Dean is a recovering attorney whose wrting has appeared at The Awl, Bitch, The American Prospect and The Rumpus. A Canadian Air Force brat, she moved a lot and doesn\u2019t really feel like she\u2019s \u201cfrom\u201d anywhere too specific. But she has most recently called Montr\u00e9al, Toronto, and Brooklyn home. Michelle holds undergraduate and law degrees from McGill University. She will soon also hold an L.L.M. from the University of Toronto. While at NYU she plans to produce a series of reported pieces about the sordid business of lawyering.  Will Hunt is writing about humanity\u2019s deep-rooted, irrational relationship with caves, catacombs, tunnels and other mysterious spaces underground and out of sight. The project is based on a year-long Thomas J. Watson Fellowship during which he traveled to 13 countries around the world, exploring subterranean spaces and documenting the myths and legends attached to them. He has contributed to DISCOVER, Outside, Men's Journal and Rolling Stone. Born in Providence, RI, he has a B.A. in English and Portuguese from Middlebury College. He lives aboveground in Brooklyn. Find him online at willhunt.net. Aaron Labaree studied English at Oberlin College. Since then, he has worked in publishing, editing, and politics. He plans to write about education reform while at NYU.  Natalie Levine , originally from a small mining town in northern Ontario, currently lives in Toronto. Although she left the Canadian North for Toronto before she was a year old, she still contends that the snow, the cold, and the hockey games played on the frozen lake behind her house (watched from her crib, of course), left a permanent imprint on her life. She\u2019s not yet sure whether it was the early thrust out of, and into, two very different landscapes, or the more likely culprit of being raised with the neuroticism inherent in any Jewish upbringing, that forged her fascination with the forces that shape us and the means by which we come to terms with the decisions we make. Either way, it was that very fascination that led her to NYU, where she intends to write about the lengths and risks we all seem willing to take when finding (or creating) meaning in our lives is involved. Per Liljas has for the past four years only been back in his native Sweden during the light, (comparatively) warm summers. The rest of this time, when not daydreaming about pickled herring, he has spent freelancing for Swedish publications from Latin America, South Asia, Africa and the Middle East. During his time at NYU he will be writing about poverty reduction programs in New York. He has a B.A. in Social Anthropology and can be found online at www.perliljas.net .

Brooks is a veteran education journalist from Wayne County, Michigan who began his journalism career in 2000. Voted as one of the nation's best beat bloggers, Brooks is a former Associated Press writer, and has had his byline published in newspapers and magazines across the country.

He holds a B.S. in News/Editorial Journalism and General Political Science from Central Michigan University. For fun, he likes to travel, exercise, toy with small electronics and pretend he's a page designer.   Jessica Campbell has been reliving the traumas of adolescence for the past five years as a middle school and high school English teacher in Brooklyn, NY. She entered the New York City Teaching Fellows in 2005 and subsequently earned her MS in Teaching from Pace University. Jessica loves her students and the art of education; but, in the process of helping her students craft their writing, she realized she was sacrificing her own. Ergo, the full-time pursuit of journalism. Jessica graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania with a dual BA degree in Creative Writing and Classical Studies. During her years as an undergraduate, she wrote for The Daily Pennsylvanian, 34th Street Magazine, Merrick Life, and interned at Harper's Bazaar. In her non-existent free time she cooks large batches of vegetarian food, fashions intricate itineraries for trips to Acadia, Varenna, and Sedona, and ponders the significance of New York's ubiquitous psychics.   Kristi Goldade spent the past two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in eastern Ukraine. She taught English and started a journalism center, but mostly, survived cold weather in her dacha. Kristi earned a B.A. in English and a concentration in social justice from the University of Minnesota. While there, she wrote stories for the university's web and print publications, as well as grants for an avant-garde space, Bedlam Theatre. She grew up in the Red River Valley and still has a soft spot for small towns. This summer she's a janitor for a local technical college. When she's not shampooing carpets, she's outside on a bike.   Dan Kedmey graduated from Carleton College with a B.A. in Economics. Since then, he has worked as a research analyst at a consulting firm in Washington D.C., and then as Director of Assignment Strategy at Teach For America, a not-for-profit organization based in New York. No one ever fully understood what he did for a living, despite his best efforts to explain it to them. Their attention would wander as soon as he mentioned the word \"data.\" While he is proud of the skills he has developed in Excel over the past four years, he looks forward to closing the spreadsheets this summer and enrolling in the literary reportage program at NYU. When Dan isn't crunching numbers, he enjoys walking through Manhattan, thirty blocks at a time, and searching for restaurants that can satisfy his cravings for certain kinds of junk food.   Allyson Polsky McCabe comes to Literary Reportage from a Lectureship in the English Department at Yale University. Allyson's background is in cultural theory and rhetoric and she has published broadly in scholarly venues. However, over time she has gravitated toward narrative nonfiction and she's interested in covering the academic world from this perspective. While many aspiring writers hang up their quills to become English professors, Allyson is experiencing this process in reverse!   Andrea Mu\u00f1oz lived in Santiago until she moved to California in mid 2008. She holds a B.A. on Philosophy from Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile and worked on David Hume's epistemology for her thesis project. A contributor for El S\u00e1bado, a supplement to the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, she gravitates toward stories about immigration. She enjoys German boardgames and is currently trying to convince her neighbors of uniting efforts on buying a cow so she can learn how to make her own cheese.   Nathaniel Page grew up in a salty village on the north coast of California. His formative experiences include an angry and drunken adolescence, the death of his father in a freak saw mill accident, two frustrating interactions with women, several years spent maundering across the globe, and a lifelong struggle with his neurons. He earned a degree in philosophy from UC Santa Barbara and briefly worked as a stringer for a Los Angeles newspaper. Last year he embarked upon a spiritual journey that changed his perspective of life. He values courage, honesty, openness, and forceful resolve, and would like to be a net asset to humanity by the time he dies.   Heather Rogers grew up in the border town of El Paso, Texas, where she developed the nerve she'd need to be a freelance journalist. She earned a degree in studio art and went on to day jobs in construction and with homeless youth. Teaching herself how to use a video camera she made a short documentary on garbage in 2002. Much to her surprise the project expanded into a book, Gone Tomorrow: The Hidden Life of Garbage (The New Press 2005). Her second book, Green Gone Wrong (Scribner 2010), takes on the myth that we can buy our way out of environmental crisis. Her byline has appeared in The New York Times Magazine, Mother Jones, the American Prospect, and The Nation. Her reporting has taken her everywhere from organic farms and eco-villages to dusty rural India and the rainforest on Borneo. On days off she can be found wandering through museums, watching films, and cooking with friends.   Elaine Stuart was most recently the senior associate features/travel editor at Modern Bride, enjoying far-flung assignments in Tahiti and Turkey until Cond\u00e9 Nast closed the magazine last fall. Before that she worked at Child and interned at New York. As a freelancer, she has contributed to a number of national, regional and digital publications. She holds a B.A. in English and Psychology from Georgetown University, where she was a member and co-director of the student dance company and wrote her honors thesis on contemporary dance criticism. Prior to college, she attended high school for ballet at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and danced with the Charleston Ballet Theatre and Richmond Ballet.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Bios - 2009   Patrick Arden just left a job as a senior reporter at Metro New York. For nearly a decade, he was the managing editor of the Chicago Reader, a pioneer of the alternative-newsweekly movement. He's also been the editor-in-chief of Illinois Times, a winner of a general excellence award from the Illinois Press Association. He has published stories at Salon.com, the Chicago Sun-Times, the New York Post, and other places.   Mark Byrne graduated from Columbia College in Chicago, where he was an editor of the college newspaper. While in school, he contributed to a number of local magazines, including Chicago Magazine, where he also interned. He was the associate editor at Featherproof Books, a small literary press, and an intern at New York Magazine, in which he still enjoys an occasional byline. Most recently, he worked as a freelance editor at Popular Science. Mark grew up primarily in Wisconsin, where he successfully avoided picking up an accent.   Alexandra Cardia graduated from Oberlin College with a B.A. in Art History and English. She did her Honors work on Spanish regionalist architecture, specifically on public spaces that are both geographically rooted and globally relevant. For the past year she has worked as an editorial assistant at Cabinet, a Brooklyn-based quarterly magazine of art and culture.   Marianne Do was born in Melbourne, Australia, and raised in Saudi Arabia until she moved to Houston, Texas at the age of eleven. She graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in Architecture, and dedicated a couple of summers to teach high school students how to design buildings (not that she really had the credentials to do so). She has a weakness for makeshift shelters, hand-crafted signs, and odd renovation projects.   Katherine Don holds a B.A. in biological anthropology from Northwestern University. After graduation she meandered about in indecision, initiated short-lived careers in publishing, nonprofit management, and social work, and freelance wrote for books published by such houses as Publications International and St. Martin's Press. She believes that effective journalism must always couple with compelling narrative, and looks forward to the opportunity to prove this premise through her own writing. She is easily and overly amused by phenomena such as the triple consecutive appearance of \"in,\" sentence two above.   Clara Kim graduated from Columbia College, with B.A. in English literature and a visual art minor. After college, she went back to Korea, the country she grew up in, and spent the past two years traveling around the coastal villages, teaching English at a North Korean refugee school, and working as a freelance translator. Curious about the way people dress and write, she is also loves drawing out the natural storyteller in others.   Andrew Marantz tried a bit of everything at Brown. His interest in philosophy led him to India, where he learned Vedic epistemology and how to eat with his hands. His interest in cognitive science led him to Nepal, where he worked on a hypoxia study at Everest Base Camp. His interest in the politics of mass incarceration led him to an upstate New York prison town, which then became the subject of his undergraduate thesis. After college, he followed the herd to Brooklyn, where he worked as a freelance journalist, researcher, and conversation starter, writing for such places as Slate, Heeb, and Time Out New York. Andrew thinks the four most overrated things in life are bars, World War II movies, Sonic Youth, and home fries.   Marta Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez studied Journalism at Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona because she wanted to write. Thanks to New Journalism she discovered that literary techniques were a great tool to explain our complex world. Unfortunately, Spain offers few opportunities for in-depth reporting, not even in important media such as El Pa\u00eds, where she interned. Not wishing to stay in the same place for a long time, she went to live in Berlin and travelled constantly because of her work at a tourism magazine. New York is her new boot camp, where she will look for stories about immigration and generational conflicts, especially between women.   Robert Moor completed his B.A. in Literary Arts at Brown University. Though his studies mostly consisted of writing strange, genre-bending fiction (with literary revolutionaries like Robert Coover and Thalia Field) and fiery, student-activist journalism (contributing to and editing the College Hill Independent, the weekly Brown/RISD student newspaper), his best work strives to combine the experimental spirit of postmodern literature with the factual constraints of journalism. He is currently thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail.   Lisa Peterson-de la Cueva betrayed her Midwestern roots by moving to New York to attend Barnard College. She has a master's degree in teaching, which she used while teaching social studies to junior high students in New York City and English to adult immigrants in the Twin Cities. Her transition from teaching to writing landed her in the field of citizen journalism, where she developed a passion for subduing rancor about its validity. She has published work in various Minnesota publications including the Twin Cities Daily Planet, the MN Women's Press, the Rake, and KFAI radio.   Carrie Rothburd earned a B.A. in fine arts/photography in her native NY before moving to Wisconsin, where she completed an M.A. in educational policy studies, interned at The Progressive Magazine (where she also worked as art assistant), and worked with community-based nonprofits. During subsequent stops in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, she finished an M.A. in fiction, began to ride dressage, and adopted two dogs, three cats, and a horse. Carrie earns her living as a freelance grant-writing consultant and writes company histories for a business encyclopedia.   Jenell Schwab holds a B.S. in anthropology from the University of California at Riverside. A natural wanderer, she adopted the high Sierra Nevada as a home where she wrote furiously for a ski town press. Life was copasetic until she happened upon a rabbit hole that led her to trade the \"landlubbing\" lifestyle for a whirlwind tour of the domestic, offshore oil industry. She has been occupied recently by road trips, sailing in Puget Sound and dodging cacti in the Sonoran Desert.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Victoria Beale is a journalist who has worked in the UK, Canada and the US. Her most recent reporting project was a story about ten and eleven year old boys tried on conspiracy to murder charges in rural Washington state, for Buzzfeed Longform. David Grann described the article as \"Deeply reported, disturbing, important,\" and it was chosen as one of The New Yorker's Weekend Reads. Since graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Lit she has written for the New Republic on phone hacking and the London riots, for the Economist on Rebecca West and Greek cinema, as well as for the Guardian on Newcastle, bad literary marriages, and watching the same film every day for a year. She\u2019s also reviewed books for the Financial Times, Independent, and New York Times. For the last year she has been a research assistant to Patrick Radden Keefe, working on background for his articles about mining corruption in Guinea, marijuana legalisation in Washington and Colorado, and more recently pieces on insider trading in New York hedge funds as well as Swiss banks and offshore accounts. Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money. Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU. Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again. With roots in Washington, D.C. and Stuttgart, Germany, Natalie Lampert has traveled and written her way through thirty countries. Despite this, she still struggles using chopsticks. Natalie received her B.A. in English and International Relations from Elon University in 2011. She has worked in a variety of writing environments, including as a reporter for an Austrian newspaper, as managing editor of her college\u2019s literary journal, and as an intern at a publishing house in Sri Lanka. As a 2012-2013 Fulbright scholar in Sri Lanka, Natalie taught contemporary literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia. Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation. Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South. Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again. Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view. Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more. In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change. Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil. She earned a B.S. in Studio Art at NYU and followed it up with an M.A. in History of Art at University College London. After working in the UK arts sector for several years, Cleuci made a career change into journalism. She has written for print and online publications in her native Brazil. Currently, she works for Cracked.com, both as a moderator for its Writers\u2019 Workshop and as a reporter for the more recent Personal Experience features. In the process, she has interviewed, among others, a Russian mail-order bride, the survivor of an end-times Christian cult and a woman with a neurological condition that prevents her from recognizing faces. Maggie Whitehead spent the past four years in Baltimore, Maryland working for the International Rescue Committee as a caseworker for newly arrived refugees. While serving a wide refugee client base, she worked closely with trauma victims and wrote individual histories to secure disability status for refugees with psychosomatic conditions. Prior to refugee resettlement, she lived in Tamil Nadu with a dozen mischievous teenage boys, who taught her bad Indian manners and the convoluted nature of English phonetics. Despite years of communicating mainly with limited English speakers, Maggie hopes to regain her vocabulary and put it to use. She is eager to unite her passions for writing and advocacy at NYU, and plans to focus her work around the successes and trials of human migration.

  \u00a0   About the Program   Journalism schools produce good reporters; MFA programs train beautiful writers. In the Literary Reportage concentration, we combine the best of both. Our students pursue their own long form projects, mentored by veteran writers in reporting classes, literature seminars, writing workshops and master classes taught by working editors .   Reporting is at the center of everything Literary Reportage students do. Whether you want to write a memoir, an expose, a portrait of a person or place, an extended consideration on the subject of your passion, it all starts with reporting. We\u2019ll teach you how to do what Tom Wolfe once termed \u201cstylish reporting.\u201d Many writing programs teach memoir, and that's something you can do in Literary Reportage, as well. The difference here is that we stress reporting \u2013 adding value to personal experience by collecting relevant information from the world outside one's head. Did your sister join a cult? Part of your mission would be to learn about the cult, past and present. Are there acquaintances from days gone by who could help set a remembered story in context? Part of your job might be to find them. That way, when you sit down to fashion your narrative, you'll have a richer set of materials to work with.You will then channel that reporting into well-researched, compelling narratives, which you will publish in professional venues while at NYU and, of course, beyond.   How do you apply? Like an aspiring novelist who submits short stories to an MFA program in the hopes of writing a novel, you submit a sample of your existing work (articles, blogs, videos, podcasts, essays--published or not), and a description of what you want to do while at NYU, whether a specific project or a kind of project. Think big, but also think concretely: What particular works or authors have inspired you and your project? What journalistic forms could you imagine it taking? What models do you have in mind?   Projects can be local, national, or international in scope. But since much of your reporting will be done while in residence at NYU, your project should have an NYC dimension. Some students divide their time between their final international or national project and its local iterations. In addition, access is important. You can\u2019t report on a subject if your subject won\u2019t talk to you. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but there are some worlds, like Hollywood, that simply can\u2019t be covered by NYC-based reporters. We don\u2019t care if you change your mind later \u2013 experimentation is part of the idea. That goes for form, as well: Some Literary Reportage students want to write books, others want to write articles. Some want to combine podcasts, video, books and articles. We will teach you how to work in all of these forms. We\u2019ll teach you how to use the technology (come visit and see our high tech facilities), whether in semester-long classes or intensive, week-long workshops. (All Literary Reportage students take a month-long, non-credit introductory multimedia course covering video, audio, slideshow and web skills.) But the most important thing we teach is how think in terms of \u201cstories.\u201d Rigorously reported, well-researched, imaginative, artfully written stories.   \u00a0   How does Literary Reportage work?   The courses are divided between journalism seminars and writing workshops. The first semester leans toward the former, while the remaining semesters leans toward the latter. For an overview of the curriculum click here . Literary Reportage became a full-fledged concentration in 2009, growing out of the Portfolio honors track , in which students learned how to build a coherent body of work over the course of two semesters. It worked well, and we suspected it would work even better if students applied with projects already in mind and had more time to complete their work. How does Literary Reportage differ from other the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s other concentrations and programs? Our applicants must apply with a project in mind and, like the Global program, Literary Reportage students produce a master\u2019s project in their fourth and final semester, during which you need not be in residence.   \u00a0   Final Projects   Here are some of the final projects Literary Reportage students have produced in our first three years:   \"We Were All Going To Be Queens,\" a reported memoir about the Catholic cult Regnum Christi   \"Ballerina 2.0,\" about dancer Drew Jacoby's use of new media for self-promotion   \"Mother of Invention,\u201d a reported memoir about a single woman's decision to have a child   \u201cOn Trails,\u201d a meditation on the twists and turns of human navigation   \u201cAlone in America,\u201d a report on Korean students studying abroad   \u201cSikhing for God,\u201d a report on a New Mexican yoga cult   \u201cWrecking the House that Ruth Built,\u201d a proposal, sample chapter and outline for a book about corruption and Yankee Stadium   \u201cChristianity 2.0,\u201d a report on home worship and the reaction against the mega-church phenomenon   \u201cWhen the Facts of Life Aren\u2019t Facts,\u201d a report on sex education for students with special needs   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Master Class   The Fall 2014 Literary Reportage Master Class was taught by Sasha Weiss, the literary editor of\u00a0 Newyorker.com . Before \u00a0Before coming to\u00a0 The New Yorker , she was an editor at\u00a0 The New York Review of Books .\u00a0 Her writing has appeared on the\u00a0 Newyorker.com ,\u00a0 The Paris Review , Tablet, and elsewhere.   \u00a0     \u00a0       Upcoming Events         Program News   Congratulations to:   Laura Smith , Literary Reportage Kristian Jebsen , Magazine   Kristian Jebsen and Laura Smith, graduate students at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Carter Journalism Institute are pleased to announce a fully funded fellowship for students in, and alumni of, the Literary Reportage concentration.\u00a0 The fellowship offers an opportunity to develop a major essay, memoir, or feature piece during a month-long residency. Writers will work on their manuscript during weekly consultations with faculty editors, and round-table discussions with the other participants. By placing writers in a situation designed to challenge and stimulate their creativity, the program encourages the exploration of new ideas in journalism and experimentation with writing a piece that might otherwise be difficult to complete. The fellowship covers round trip airfare to Banff, and food and lodging during the month at the Banff Centre for the Arts.

Besides room and board, the Centre gives each writer a private cabin in the forested Leighton Artists\u2019 Colony, and plenty of time to write... I did not want to leave.

Her most recent reporting project was a story about ten and eleven year old boys tried on conspiracy to murder charges in rural Washington state, for Buzzfeed Longform. David Grann described the article as \"Deeply reported, disturbing, important,\" and it was chosen as one of The New Yorker's Weekend Reads. Since graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Lit she has written for the New Republic on phone hacking and the London riots, for the Economist on Rebecca West and Greek cinema, as well as for the Guardian on Newcastle, bad literary marriages, and watching the same film every day for a year. She\u2019s also reviewed books for the Financial Times, Independent, and New York Times. For the last year she has been a research assistant to Patrick Radden Keefe, working on background for his articles about mining corruption in Guinea, marijuana legalisation in Washington and Colorado, and more recently pieces on insider trading in New York hedge funds as well as Swiss banks and offshore accounts.   Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money.   Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU.   Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again.

She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia.   Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation.   Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South.   Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again.   Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view.   Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more.   In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change.   Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil.

Maggie Whitehead spent the past four years in Baltimore, Maryland working for the International Rescue Committee as a caseworker for newly arrived refugees. While serving a wide refugee client base, she worked closely with trauma victims and wrote individual histories to secure disability status for refugees with psychosomatic conditions. Prior to refugee resettlement, she lived in Tamil Nadu with a dozen mischievous teenage boys, who taught her bad Indian manners and the convoluted nature of English phonetics. Despite years of communicating mainly with limited English speakers, Maggie hopes to regain her vocabulary and put it to use. She is eager to unite her passions for writing and advocacy at NYU, and plans to focus her work around the successes and trials of human migration.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Literary Reportage 2013   Elizabeth Flock &lt; elizabethflock@gmail.com &gt; is a journalist with a deep interest in social issues and foreign news reporting.

Although she left the Canadian North for Toronto before she was a year old, she still contends that the snow, the cold, and the hockey games played on the frozen lake behind her house (watched from her crib, of course), left a permanent imprint on her life. She\u2019s not yet sure whether it was the early thrust out of, and into, two very different landscapes, or the more likely culprit of being raised with the neuroticism inherent in any Jewish upbringing, that forged her fascination with the forces that shape us and the means by which we come to terms with the decisions we make. Either way, it was that very fascination that led her to NYU, where she intends to write about the lengths and risks we all seem willing to take when finding (or creating) meaning in our lives is involved.

Prior to college, she attended high school for ballet at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and danced with the Charleston Ballet Theatre and Richmond Ballet.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Literary Reportage Bios - 2009   Patrick Arden just left a job as a senior reporter at Metro New York. For nearly a decade, he was the managing editor of the Chicago Reader, a pioneer of the alternative-newsweekly movement. He's also been the editor-in-chief of Illinois Times, a winner of a general excellence award from the Illinois Press Association. He has published stories at Salon.com, the Chicago Sun-Times, the New York Post, and other places.   Mark Byrne graduated from Columbia College in Chicago, where he was an editor of the college newspaper. While in school, he contributed to a number of local magazines, including Chicago Magazine, where he also interned. He was the associate editor at Featherproof Books, a small literary press, and an intern at New York Magazine, in which he still enjoys an occasional byline. Most recently, he worked as a freelance editor at Popular Science. Mark grew up primarily in Wisconsin, where he successfully avoided picking up an accent.   Alexandra Cardia graduated from Oberlin College with a B.A. in Art History and English. She did her Honors work on Spanish regionalist architecture, specifically on public spaces that are both geographically rooted and globally relevant. For the past year she has worked as an editorial assistant at Cabinet, a Brooklyn-based quarterly magazine of art and culture.   Marianne Do was born in Melbourne, Australia, and raised in Saudi Arabia until she moved to Houston, Texas at the age of eleven. She graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in Architecture, and dedicated a couple of summers to teach high school students how to design buildings (not that she really had the credentials to do so). She has a weakness for makeshift shelters, hand-crafted signs, and odd renovation projects.   Katherine Don holds a B.A. in biological anthropology from Northwestern University. After graduation she meandered about in indecision, initiated short-lived careers in publishing, nonprofit management, and social work, and freelance wrote for books published by such houses as Publications International and St. Martin's Press. She believes that effective journalism must always couple with compelling narrative, and looks forward to the opportunity to prove this premise through her own writing. She is easily and overly amused by phenomena such as the triple consecutive appearance of \"in,\" sentence two above.   Clara Kim graduated from Columbia College, with B.A. in English literature and a visual art minor. After college, she went back to Korea, the country she grew up in, and spent the past two years traveling around the coastal villages, teaching English at a North Korean refugee school, and working as a freelance translator. Curious about the way people dress and write, she is also loves drawing out the natural storyteller in others.   Andrew Marantz tried a bit of everything at Brown. His interest in philosophy led him to India, where he learned Vedic epistemology and how to eat with his hands. His interest in cognitive science led him to Nepal, where he worked on a hypoxia study at Everest Base Camp. His interest in the politics of mass incarceration led him to an upstate New York prison town, which then became the subject of his undergraduate thesis. After college, he followed the herd to Brooklyn, where he worked as a freelance journalist, researcher, and conversation starter, writing for such places as Slate, Heeb, and Time Out New York. Andrew thinks the four most overrated things in life are bars, World War II movies, Sonic Youth, and home fries.   Marta Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez studied Journalism at Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona because she wanted to write. Thanks to New Journalism she discovered that literary techniques were a great tool to explain our complex world. Unfortunately, Spain offers few opportunities for in-depth reporting, not even in important media such as El Pa\u00eds, where she interned. Not wishing to stay in the same place for a long time, she went to live in Berlin and travelled constantly because of her work at a tourism magazine. New York is her new boot camp, where she will look for stories about immigration and generational conflicts, especially between women.   Robert Moor completed his B.A. in Literary Arts at Brown University. Though his studies mostly consisted of writing strange, genre-bending fiction (with literary revolutionaries like Robert Coover and Thalia Field) and fiery, student-activist journalism (contributing to and editing the College Hill Independent, the weekly Brown/RISD student newspaper), his best work strives to combine the experimental spirit of postmodern literature with the factual constraints of journalism. He is currently thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail.   Lisa Peterson-de la Cueva betrayed her Midwestern roots by moving to New York to attend Barnard College. She has a master's degree in teaching, which she used while teaching social studies to junior high students in New York City and English to adult immigrants in the Twin Cities. Her transition from teaching to writing landed her in the field of citizen journalism, where she developed a passion for subduing rancor about its validity. She has published work in various Minnesota publications including the Twin Cities Daily Planet, the MN Women's Press, the Rake, and KFAI radio.   Carrie Rothburd earned a B.A. in fine arts/photography in her native NY before moving to Wisconsin, where she completed an M.A. in educational policy studies, interned at The Progressive Magazine (where she also worked as art assistant), and worked with community-based nonprofits. During subsequent stops in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, she finished an M.A. in fiction, began to ride dressage, and adopted two dogs, three cats, and a horse. Carrie earns her living as a freelance grant-writing consultant and writes company histories for a business encyclopedia.   Jenell Schwab holds a B.S. in anthropology from the University of California at Riverside. A natural wanderer, she adopted the high Sierra Nevada as a home where she wrote furiously for a ski town press. Life was copasetic until she happened upon a rabbit hole that led her to trade the \"landlubbing\" lifestyle for a whirlwind tour of the domestic, offshore oil industry. She has been occupied recently by road trips, sailing in Puget Sound and dodging cacti in the Sonoran Desert.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Victoria Beale is a journalist who has worked in the UK, Canada and the US. Her most recent reporting project was a story about ten and eleven year old boys tried on conspiracy to murder charges in rural Washington state, for Buzzfeed Longform. David Grann described the article as \"Deeply reported, disturbing, important,\" and it was chosen as one of The New Yorker's Weekend Reads. Since graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in English Lit she has written for the New Republic on phone hacking and the London riots, for the Economist on Rebecca West and Greek cinema, as well as for the Guardian on Newcastle, bad literary marriages, and watching the same film every day for a year. She\u2019s also reviewed books for the Financial Times, Independent, and New York Times. For the last year she has been a research assistant to Patrick Radden Keefe, working on background for his articles about mining corruption in Guinea, marijuana legalisation in Washington and Colorado, and more recently pieces on insider trading in New York hedge funds as well as Swiss banks and offshore accounts. Alex Brokaw received his B.A. in English and Creative Writing from Emory University in 2011. Following school he helped run a literary journal before taking work as a copywriter. Then, after someone asked him if he wouldn\u2019t mind writing a few articles, he began as a financial reporter. The work was enjoyable, and he continued as a reporter on and off for the next two years, covering areas such as agribusiness, global trade, and emerging economies. Somewhere along the line he ran across digital currencies, didn\u2019t pay too much attention, and then, months later came back around. He\u2019s been building his coverage of the emerging space ever since. He\u2019s particularly interested in the impact of the technology behind digital currencies to things that do and don\u2019t have to do with money. Jaspal Chana is a recent graduate of the University of Durham with a degree in Theology &amp; Religion. During this time he has spent a year living in Sweden, interned at an English language newspaper in Dubai, written a number of commentary pieces for the university newspaper and featured as a fortnightly columnist on a student website writing about the artistic value of various aspects of popular culture. Through his studies he has become particularly interested in the role of religion in the American political system as well as the relationship between personal identity, nation and culture, which he hopes to explore through the religion/journalism program at NYU. Michelle Kim is a native of South Korea and has worked at the Seoul bureau of Thomson Reuters for the past year. She wrote a number of features on North Korea, especially on the regime\u2019s human rights abuse and the reunion of war-torn families. While interviewing North Korean defectors, she found the lighter conversations they shared just as intriguing as their harrowing accounts of midnight escapes and prison camp atrocities. Their hopes for marriage and family, what school life was like in a democratic society and the new dreams they cultivated\u2014these topics were not shocking news items, but added personality to each of their tales. So during her time at NYU, she hopes to bond with North Korean defectors who may be living in the New York area and write longer, detailed narratives of each individual\u2019s experience. Michelle earned a B.A. in International Studies from Ewha Womans University in 2013, with concentrations in Diplomacy and Asian Studies. She loves the smell of old library books and reading her favorite novels over and over again. With roots in Washington, D.C. and Stuttgart, Germany, Natalie Lampert has traveled and written her way through thirty countries. Despite this, she still struggles using chopsticks. Natalie received her B.A. in English and International Relations from Elon University in 2011. She has worked in a variety of writing environments, including as a reporter for an Austrian newspaper, as managing editor of her college\u2019s literary journal, and as an intern at a publishing house in Sri Lanka. As a 2012-2013 Fulbright scholar in Sri Lanka, Natalie taught contemporary literature at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. She works during summer months for National Geographic, leading student expeditions focused on creative writing and photography. At NYU, she plans to write about meditation and its practitioners, exploring the juxtaposition of insight meditation\u2019s increasing popularity in urban epicenters such as New York City and the rise of Buddhist extremism in South Asia. Hannah McCarthy is a graduate of Bennington College, where she earned her B.A. in Philosophy and Theatre. After completing her thesis work on Brecht and the power of the theatrical event, she became interested in community ritual and the theatrics of religious worship. Writing for the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Gazette, Hannah explored the peculiar rites of the insular year-round community of artists, business owners and fisherman. She spent the following year travelling the U.S. in a beat-up white 2001 Odyssey (named Hal), researching religion and the desire for community across generations and geographies. In the late nights and wee morning hours between farming, fundraising for a couple of non-profits and working as a film producer, Hannah has written about these various microcosms. She intends to continue this work while at NYU, concentrating the shifting liturgical landscape of a spiritually displaced younger generation. Michela Pfeifer is Austrian but - after studying in France and the UK and working as a \u201cspin doctor\u201d in the European Parliament in Brussels for several years\u2013 she would more appropriately define herself as a \u201cEuropean above all\u201d. After ghost-writing speeches and articles for politicians, mainly in the field of human rights and the Middle East, she turned to journalism after reporting on her recent trip to South America in Revolve, a Brussels-based environmentalist magazine. She has notably written on renewable energy, environment and sustainability, democracy and fundamental rights. In \u201canother\u201d life, she spent six months learning yoga in India, worked in banking in the Principality of Liechtenstein and was a member of the Austrian national gymnastics team. Michela speaks German, English, French and Spanish and holds a degree in Foreign Languages with Business, a postgraduate in Translating for Cinema and a MA in International Politics from the University of Paris-South. Raella Rayside spent her entire life building her dance career. She loved the idea of evoking emotion with nothing but her body, and tirelessly studied technique and body conditioning to become an expert at it. She started at NYU as a dance major, but under her parent\u2019s insistence and her conscience\u2019s pleas for something more stable she wandered into an introductory journalism class. It wasn\u2019t until her second year that she discovered the art of literary journalism. She was enthralled by the ideas of long-form narrative and the personal essay, and quickly realized that she had a gift for storytelling on paper as well. Raella graduated in 2013 from NYU with a BFA in dance and a BA in journalism. She is excited to continue honing her craft as a writer and a narrator and can\u2019t wait to put pen to paper again. Renee Saleh studied modern literature at the University of California, Santa Cruz, a concentration that encouraged her study of the literature produced by socially and economically depoliticized ethnic groups. She became increasingly interested in the manifestation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict here in the United States, and particularly in the microcosm of New York City. She maintains an open-minded curiosity about the essence of identity and stubbornness inherent to a conflict such as this one, and hopes to eventually write long-form pieces regarding her own identity and relationship to the conflict. Post 9/11 Islamophobia is another interest of hers, as she plans to use that concept as one of many lenses under which she will parse the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since graduation, she has had experience working with a couple different non profits, both of which were socio-political by nature and have solidified her desire to combine her love of the written word with greater social issues that have heavily impacted her own world view. Lindsey Smith struggles to flip pancakes, fried eggs, and other flat things in pans. She can't dance to save her life, and should stay away from singing in public, for everyone's sake. Despite these deficits, she graduated from Stanford University in 2011 with a BA in Italian and English: Creative Writing. In 2008-2009, she went to Lecce, Italy as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, where she studied sociology, economics, anthropology, psychology, and (bewilderingly) Spanish at the Universit\u00e0 del Salento. There, \"in the heel of the boot,\" Lindsey was first exposed to the complicated interplay between organized crime and social norms, a relationship that has fascinated her since and will anchor her research at NYU. After graduating, she worked in venture philanthropy in the Bay Area, vetting, selecting, and coaching a portfolio of start-up nonprofits. During that time, she also wrote on topics from family, to football, to books, for literary and philanthropic publications including, most recently, Narrative Magazine. As always, she is eager to learn and do so much more. In 1986 Giulia Alexandra Smythies was conceived in a small flat in the center of London. For six months prior to her conception, her starving parents had subsisted on nothing but small packets of jaffa cakes. Their baby was born fat and curly-headed, with an unquenchable thirst for chocolate. They named her Giulia, after an Alpine mountain range in Italy, the country of their birth. Without realising it, Giulia grew up confused about her identity. Not only did she speak three languages, have two passports, and live in Alabama, Italy, Seattle, and Germany, but nobody could actually pronounce her name. In 2012 her search for meaning led her to Aboriginal Australia where she connected with Mundanara Bayles and her elders, Lilla Watson and Mary Graham. In a speech given at the 1985 United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Nairobi, Lilla Watson is famous for saying, \"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound with mine, then let us walk together.\" Giulia believes that a society is only as healthy as its sickest member and that as long as there is injustice for some, there will be suffering by all. She is at NYU to learn the art of creating change. Cleuci de Oliveira hails from Brasilia, Brazil. She earned a B.S. in Studio Art at NYU and followed it up with an M.A. in History of Art at University College London. After working in the UK arts sector for several years, Cleuci made a career change into journalism. She has written for print and online publications in her native Brazil. Currently, she works for Cracked.com, both as a moderator for its Writers\u2019 Workshop and as a reporter for the more recent Personal Experience features. In the process, she has interviewed, among others, a Russian mail-order bride, the survivor of an end-times Christian cult and a woman with a neurological condition that prevents her from recognizing faces. Maggie Whitehead spent the past four years in Baltimore, Maryland working for the International Rescue Committee as a caseworker for newly arrived refugees. While serving a wide refugee client base, she worked closely with trauma victims and wrote individual histories to secure disability status for refugees with psychosomatic conditions. Prior to refugee resettlement, she lived in Tamil Nadu with a dozen mischievous teenage boys, who taught her bad Indian manners and the convoluted nature of English phonetics. Despite years of communicating mainly with limited English speakers, Maggie hopes to regain her vocabulary and put it to use. She is eager to unite her passions for writing and advocacy at NYU, and plans to focus her work around the successes and trials of human migration.

A journalism background is not required. Along with the completed application, the applicant must provide one official transcript from each undergraduate or graduate institution attended, three letters of recommendation, and three writing samples. These samples should be indicative of the applicant's best overall work and need not have been published. A statement of purpose, which should adhere to the guidelines listed in the journalism application form, is also required.   Students who enroll in the graduate journalism program score, on average, above 600 on the verbal test of the Graduate Record Examinations (GREs) and at 5.0 on the GRE analytical writing test, and have an undergraduate grade point average of above 3.0. No specific GRE subject test is necessary. International applicants must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) unless English is their native language or they have completed their undergraduate education at an institution where English is the primary language of instruction. A minimum TOEFL score of 100 on the Internet-based test is required, or a score of 250 on the computer-based test or 600 on the paper-based test is required. For the computer- and paper-based tests, a minimum score of 5.0 on the Test of Written English (TWE) is required. (For the cultural reporting and criticism concentration, a score of 6.0 is required.) International applicants MUST have a fluent command of written English.   The GREs and TOEFL are given periodically throughout the year. Specific test dates can be obtained by calling the Educational Testing Service, 609-921-9000, or by visiting their Web site at www.ets.org .   Applications are accepted for fall admission only. Forms may be downloaded from the GSAS website . Please adhere to the deadline dates published in the GSAS Application Appendix. Applications submitted after the due date are considered on a rolling admission basis if seats remain, but many programs fill rapidly.   Prospective students are invited to visit the department during the fall and spring academic terms to learn more about the program. We can arrange for you to sit in on a class and suggest you check Course Listings for what might coincide with your visit. To schedule a visit, please contact graduate.journalism@nyu.edu . Please note that visits should be scheduled well in advance if you wish to meet with faculty.   For first consideration from a limited pool for merit aid, we recommend that applications arrive by Jan 15, but will continue to consider submissions on a rolling basis through August 2015.     How To Apply to Literary Reportage   Have a question about Literary Reportage? Please contact Professor Robert Boynton at robert.boynton@nyu.edu .   The online application is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) admissions  website .   Come visit us at our new state-of-the-art facility at 20 Cooper Square. Applicants are encouraged to attend classes and talk to current and past students.   Read the stories and books listed in the \"Get up to Speed\" section on our archived Portfolio.   Here are some questions to think about while applying:   Describe your project. Do some research and reporting before you respond. Ideas are essential. And just as essential are specific stories-real names, real places-through which you can explore those ideas. Describe the portfolio of work you would like to complete during your studies at NYU. Which form \u2014 or combination of forms -- could you imagine your project taking? A series of reported pieces, profiles, a multi-part series, an investigation, a book proposal? Some combination of these? What might the title of your portfolio be? Think of a mock headline that captures the spirit and content of the prospective body of work. We expect your work to evolve as you rethink your original ideas, so your agenda is not set in stone.   Describe your existing \"body of work\" as a journalist, blogger, critic or just someone who writes. What have been your major themes? Where do your strengths and weaknesses lie as a writer or journalist?   What kinds of experiences inform your desire to become a journalist? What are your commitments, passions and interests? Tell us about yourself.                                                 Arthur L.
