Description       What are human rights? This course will provide an introduction to the different ways people have thought about the political, ethical and legal foundation for rights claims. It will also look at the world of human rights activism and how different organizations and social movements have used human rights discourse to fight for a wide range of issues, such as women\u2019s rights, access to housing and redress for war crimes. We will explore human rights through the work of philosophers, lawyers, journalists, activists and film directors. Readings will be wide ranging and include Karl Marx, Immananuel Kant, Charles Taylor, Martha Nussabum, Philip Alston, Makau Mutau, Katherine Franke, Mahmud Mamdani, Ken Roth, Teju Cole and others. We will also read and analyze international human rights instruments. We will also watch films such as War Don Don (Rebecca Richman Cohen\u2019s film on post-conflict human rights prosecutions in Sierra Leone) and The Pinochet Case (Patricio Guzman\u2019s film tracking accountability for human rights violations during Chile\u2019s military regime).

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Description       What are human rights? This course will provide an introduction to the different ways people have thought about the political, ethical and legal foundation for rights claims. It will also look at the world of human rights activism and how different organizations and social movements have used human rights discourse to fight for a wide range of issues, such as women\u2019s rights, access to housing and redress for war crimes. We will explore human rights through the work of philosophers, lawyers, journalists, activists and film directors. Readings will be wide ranging and include Karl Marx, Immananuel Kant, Charles Taylor, Martha Nussabum, Philip Alston, Makau Mutau, Katherine Franke, Mahmud Mamdani, Ken Roth, Teju Cole and others. We will also read and analyze international human rights instruments. We will also watch films such as War Don Don (Rebecca Richman Cohen\u2019s film on post-conflict human rights prosecutions in Sierra Leone) and The Pinochet Case (Patricio Guzman\u2019s film tracking accountability for human rights violations during Chile\u2019s military regime).

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.
