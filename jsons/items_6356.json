Description       This course uses literature, social theory, and film to explore the role of \u201curban space\u201d in mediating social movements and everyday life. We\u2019ll address the following questions: What makes a city \u201curban\u201d? Is \u201curban consciousness\u201d a necessary condition for understanding how society works and who modern people are? How can we understand the city as an object of social conflict and social change, and yet also as a political community seeking to shape its own destiny?
