Beth Bechky, UC Davis   The Work of Innovation: Community, Practice, and Materiality | Abstract | Bio | Video | Article   Public Lecture, November 9, 2011   Science Under Scrutiny: The Work and Culture of a Crime Lab | Abstract   Faculty and PhD Research Seminar, November 11, 2011   Abstract: The Work of Innovation: Community, Practice, and Materiality   Contrary to the popular &quot;lone genius&quot; image of innovation, we know that the actual work of innovation is a collective activity. A focus on this work demonstrates three aspects of organization that are key to understanding innovation: community, practice, and materiality. Community membership structures people&#39;s learning in organizations, and boundaries between communities can therefore be both barriers to and opportunities for innovation. Everyday work practices create organizational cultures that enable collective creativity, rapid coordination, and recovery from surprises. Finally, the materiality of the workplace can facilitate problem-solving, communication, and symbolic support for innovation.   Abstract: Science Under Scrutiny: The Work and Culture of a Crime Lab   Crime laboratories exemplify the complexity of doing science in the public eye. Forensic scientists working to discover the scientific &quot;truth&quot; in the evidence are also keenly aware that they work within the legal system and are engaged in science in the service of justice. This ethnography of a crime lab explores the ways in which law and science intermingle in the daily work of forensic scientists. I show how scrutiny in legal, public, and professional arenas affects organizational and individual practice. For instance, professional comparisons of other forensic subfields to forensic biology have resulted in &quot;DNA envy&quot; within the forensic science community. This is not just status envy, but is characterized by controversies over changing analytic and reporting practices. I analyze several such controversies that demonstrate the tension between scientific objectivity and analyst judgment and illustrate how institutional scrutiny is changing the practice of forensic science.   About Beth Bechky   Beth Bechky, our first Investigatio Scholar in Residency, is an associate professor of organizational behavior and technology management at the University of California, Davis. Her research focuses on how technical, science, and creative workers get things done together. As an ethnographer of work and occupations, Beth&#39;s approach to studying organization and innovation highlights the practices and material affordances of the workplace. Some recent projects have explored how problems are solved among technicians, engineers and assemblers on an R&amp;D manufacturing line, how work is coordinated on film production sets, and what enables the collective creativity of consultants and engineers.

We are also interested in exploring the \u201cecological transciptome\u201d \u2013 the dynamic gene networks found in plants in ecological environments. This work combines concepts and techniques in evolutionary and quantitative genomics, developmental biology, evolutionary ecology, and computational biology.    Genetics of Plant Domestication    Crops are plant species that have evolved in a cultural context to provide food and other products for human society. Crop species are fascinating subjects for evolutionary study, since they are examples of species that have undergone rapid diversification under intense selection pressures. They also permit us to understand the dynamic interface between genetics, evolution and human culture. We are studying the evolution of genes in rice ( Oryza sativa ). By using tools of molecular and evolutionary genomics, these studies provide insights into the processes and mechanisms that accompany cultural selection on plant species during domestication events.    The Evolution of Multicellularity and Social Behaviour    The model protist Dictyostelium discoideum has been a model for the study of social biology as well as the evolution of multicellularity. We are integrating techniques and approaches in population genetics, genomics, systems biology and glycomics to study kin discrimination and recognition in this social microbe.

Ryan Jacoby, IDEO   Leading Innovation: Process Is No Substitute | Abstract | Bio | Video   Articles - poly.edu | fastcodesign.com   Public Lecture, February 8, 2011   Abstract   Much of the discussion on innovation has centered on the structures, systems, and tools to instill innovation processes and competencies in organizations. Yet, most such initiatives fail. What gives? Tools and processes are not enough. Innovation is fundamentally a human endeavor, one that must not only be managed, but also led. Luckily these leadership behaviors can be developed. In this talk, Ryan will, through stories, explore common innovation leadership pitfalls and share a model for how to lead innovation.   About Ryan Jacoby   Ryan Jacoby co-leads IDEO&#39;s New York location. Prior to his current role he helped pioneer and grow the Business Design discipline for the firm. Ryan is passionate about designing new experiences for users and with an emphasis on Venture Design and Growth and Innovation Strategy.

He is often referred to as the first &quot;graduate&quot; from Stanford&#39;s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.   Beth Bechky, UC Davis   The Work of Innovation: Community, Practice, and Materiality | Abstract | Bio | Video | Article   Public Lecture, November 9, 2011   Science Under Scrutiny: The Work and Culture of a Crime Lab | Abstract   Faculty and PhD Research Seminar, November 11, 2011   Abstract: The Work of Innovation: Community, Practice, and Materiality   Contrary to the popular &quot;lone genius&quot; image of innovation, we know that the actual work of innovation is a collective activity. A focus on this work demonstrates three aspects of organization that are key to understanding innovation: community, practice, and materiality. Community membership structures people&#39;s learning in organizations, and boundaries between communities can therefore be both barriers to and opportunities for innovation. Everyday work practices create organizational cultures that enable collective creativity, rapid coordination, and recovery from surprises. Finally, the materiality of the workplace can facilitate problem-solving, communication, and symbolic support for innovation.   Abstract: Science Under Scrutiny: The Work and Culture of a Crime Lab   Crime laboratories exemplify the complexity of doing science in the public eye. Forensic scientists working to discover the scientific &quot;truth&quot; in the evidence are also keenly aware that they work within the legal system and are engaged in science in the service of justice. This ethnography of a crime lab explores the ways in which law and science intermingle in the daily work of forensic scientists. I show how scrutiny in legal, public, and professional arenas affects organizational and individual practice. For instance, professional comparisons of other forensic subfields to forensic biology have resulted in &quot;DNA envy&quot; within the forensic science community. This is not just status envy, but is characterized by controversies over changing analytic and reporting practices. I analyze several such controversies that demonstrate the tension between scientific objectivity and analyst judgment and illustrate how institutional scrutiny is changing the practice of forensic science.   About Beth Bechky   Beth Bechky, our first Investigatio Scholar in Residency, is an associate professor of organizational behavior and technology management at the University of California, Davis. Her research focuses on how technical, science, and creative workers get things done together. As an ethnographer of work and occupations, Beth&#39;s approach to studying organization and innovation highlights the practices and material affordances of the workplace. Some recent projects have explored how problems are solved among technicians, engineers and assemblers on an R&amp;D manufacturing line, how work is coordinated on film production sets, and what enables the collective creativity of consultants and engineers. She is currently completing an ethnography of a crime laboratory.

We are also interested in exploring the \u201cecological transciptome\u201d \u2013 the dynamic gene networks found in plants in ecological environments. This work combines concepts and techniques in evolutionary and quantitative genomics, developmental biology, evolutionary ecology, and computational biology.    Genetics of Plant Domestication    Crops are plant species that have evolved in a cultural context to provide food and other products for human society. Crop species are fascinating subjects for evolutionary study, since they are examples of species that have undergone rapid diversification under intense selection pressures. They also permit us to understand the dynamic interface between genetics, evolution and human culture. We are studying the evolution of genes in rice ( Oryza sativa ). By using tools of molecular and evolutionary genomics, these studies provide insights into the processes and mechanisms that accompany cultural selection on plant species during domestication events.    The Evolution of Multicellularity and Social Behaviour    The model protist Dictyostelium discoideum has been a model for the study of social biology as well as the evolution of multicellularity. We are integrating techniques and approaches in population genetics, genomics, systems biology and glycomics to study kin discrimination and recognition in this social microbe.
