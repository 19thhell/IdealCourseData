Studies show that good nutrition and regular meals from an early age protect against negative outcomes later in life. Mealtimes also offer a prime opportunity to build skills and strengthen relationships; families should aim to have meals together \u2013 whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner \u2013 at least five times per week.   As a parent, you are responsible for setting guidelines for your child regarding healthy eating habits. The most basic guidelines include determining when, where, and what your child eats. It is important to establish a routine around eating, and to be consistent. Schedule regular meal and snack times and discourage eating outside of those times. Additionally, meals and snacks should be eaten at the table, without screens present, and with clear rules set about acceptable mealtime behaviors. Finally, be sure to offer your child exposure to a wide variety of healthy foods that taste good, and try to represent all 5 food groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy) daily.   Mealtimes should be relaxed and friendly, and should provide room for children to explore new foods as their appetites vary and expand.\u00a0 When presenting new foods, remember that it can take 10-15 tries before your child accepts the food, so keep including it in meals even if he/she rejects it at first. By the same token, do not force your child to eat foods or quantities he/she does not want to eat. Remember, children are much better than adults at self-regulating food intake, and most children will naturally eat when hungry and stop when full.   Some children do have trouble eating properly despite being offered a wide variety of healthy foods and a safe environment in which to try new things. Signs and symptoms of problematic eating include a restricted diet (child only eats a small number of foods), fatigue (child does not consume enough food to provide enough energy to get through the day), gagging or vomiting upon smelling or tasting food, and difficulty swallowing food. If you notice that your child is struggling with these or other food-related issues, you can try some techniques to normalize eating behavior. One such technique, called food chaining, involves slowly transitioning your child from a food that he or she really enjoys to healthier or additional alternatives.   Do not hesitate to consult your pediatrician, a dietician, or one of our feeding disorder specialists if you are concerned or confused about how to help your child eat properly. As previously stated, proper diet and nutrition are some of the most important things to focus on during your child\u2019s earliest years.
