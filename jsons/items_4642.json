Generally, subject headings for books in history follow a specific pattern:   Place name -- Subdivision -- Time period .      Place names can be names of countries, regions or cities.  Subdivisions , as listed below in the examples, are standard and can be used with various place names. They describe the particular emphasis of the book.  Time period refers to the years covered by the book; time period designations vary according to place.     The following examples illustrate possible subject searches for the history of 19-century Great Britain:                Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period              s = Great Britain          History --     History --     Intellectual life --     Social conditions --     Economic conditions --     Politics and government --     Foreign relations --              19th century     Victoria, 1837-1901     19th century     19th century     1760-1860     19th century     1800-1837                 You can find information on all Western European countries by following this general pattern.     Also find information on interdisciplinary subjects with the alternate pattern:                Subject      Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period                  s = Women --     s = Middle classes --              France --     England --              History --     History --              19th century     19th century                 For more information, consult the Library of Congress Subject Headings , a 4-volume set which contains the subject headings used in BobCat and other library catalogs.

Generally, subject headings for books in history follow a specific pattern:   Place name -- Subdivision -- Time period .      Place names can be names of countries, regions or cities.  Subdivisions , as listed below in the examples, are standard and can be used with various place names. They describe the particular emphasis of the book.  Time period refers to the years covered by the book; time period designations vary according to place.     The following examples illustrate possible subject searches for the history of 19-century Great Britain:                Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period              s = Great Britain          History --     History --     Intellectual life --     Social conditions --     Economic conditions --     Politics and government --     Foreign relations --              19th century     Victoria, 1837-1901     19th century     19th century     1760-1860     19th century     1800-1837                 You can find information on all Western European countries by following this general pattern.     Also find information on interdisciplinary subjects with the alternate pattern:                Subject      Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period                  s = Women --     s = Middle classes --              France --     England --              History --     History --              19th century     19th century                 For more information, consult the Library of Congress Subject Headings , a 4-volume set which contains the subject headings used in BobCat and other library catalogs.

Generally, subject headings for books in history follow a specific pattern:   Place name -- Subdivision -- Time period .      Place names can be names of countries, regions or cities.  Subdivisions , as listed below in the examples, are standard and can be used with various place names. They describe the particular emphasis of the book.  Time period refers to the years covered by the book; time period designations vary according to place.     The following examples illustrate possible subject searches for the history of 19-century Great Britain:                Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period              s = Great Britain          History --     History --     Intellectual life --     Social conditions --     Economic conditions --     Politics and government --     Foreign relations --              19th century     Victoria, 1837-1901     19th century     19th century     1760-1860     19th century     1800-1837                 You can find information on all Western European countries by following this general pattern.     Also find information on interdisciplinary subjects with the alternate pattern:                Subject      Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period                  s = Women --     s = Middle classes --              France --     England --              History --     History --              19th century     19th century                 For more information, consult the Library of Congress Subject Headings , a 4-volume set which contains the subject headings used in BobCat and other library catalogs.
