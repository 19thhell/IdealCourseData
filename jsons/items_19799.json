Timely progress on this scientific challenge demands a well-coordinated effort involving experts in plasma science, computer science, and applied mathematics. Plasmas in the edge region of large tokamaks are in a kinetic regime with complex geometry. Issues include (i) a large pedestal pressure gradient in a weak ion collisionality regime; (ii) a non-stationary spatially inhomogeneous loss boundary in velocity space coming from a magnetic separatrix; (iii) non-Maxwellian distribution functions; (iv) irregular wall geometry, and (v) interplay between neoclassical and turbulence physics. The microturbulence and neoclassical physics time scale must be studied kinetically, while the faster and larger scale MHD modes are more efficiently studied with a fluid code. A massively parallel edge turbulence PIC code will be developed to enable self-consistent investigations of electromagnetic microturbulence and neoclassical-neutral dynamics. As an end product, an integrated code framework to study the dynamical pedestal-ELM cycle will be developed by coupling the kinetic code with an existing two-fluid code using the most advanced computer science technologies. Routines from a state-of-the-art neutrals code will be integrated into the package providing a realistic kinetic neutral recycling physics capability, enhanced by the most advanced atomic physics data support.
