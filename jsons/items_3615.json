Under the Historical and Sustainable Architecture program, offered in conjunction with London\u2019s Sir John Soane Museum, students will study with British architects, designers, builders, and developers, who are leaders in the field of adaptive reuse and sustainable architecture.       \u201cIn an era when the demolition of older buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric, but also as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable,\u201d said Program Director Mosette Broderick, a clinical associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Art History and director of its Urban Design program. \u201cThis program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures.\u201d     In September, the first group of students will arrive in London for an academic year studying methods to effect the adaptive re-use of older buildings. The nine-month program will concentrate on solutions in the United Kingdom, which graduates will be able to translate to their home countries.       \u201cThe program relies on professionals who have successfully reused both important and modest older buildings, adapting them to new uses and integrating them into new projects built around, over, and even under historic structures,\u201d Broderick added. \u201cOur students will have the rare opportunity to study with these leading practitioners.\u201d       The curriculum extends sustainable practices beyond architecture and building into the realm of urban design. Students will examine successful strategies for reviving entire districts, cities, and regions around repurposed historic buildings in areas as diverse as the London Docklands and the older industrial regions of Germany.           \u201cThese examples suggest new possibilities for post-industrial, Rust Belt cities in the U.S., such as Buffalo and Cleveland, where the numerous historic buildings provide resources to be adapted for new uses, not liabilities to be demolished,\u201d Broderick observed.   The M.A. in Historical and Sustainable Architecture is the first academic program to unite the topics of sustainable architecture, adaptive reuse, and historic preservation within a single curriculum. Combining the multiple perspectives of finance, environmentalism, education, tourism, and government policy, this program will explore older buildings as assets to real estate development.

This will help you improve your Spanish language skills while being immersed in the rhythms of Madrile\u00f1o life.   Locations of homestays are scattered throughout the city which also helps you to get acquainted with the many neighborhoods (barrios) of Madrid as you navigate the excellent public transportation systems. Homestays are generally located in older buildings, not modern high-rises.                                    Click below to view Homestay Details                                                    Homestay Details                               Homestay providers are usually host mothers (se\u00f1oras) with comfortable accommodations whose children have moved away. We also have some nuclear families with children. In most cases the se\u00f1oras have hosted NYU students for many, many years.   Meals   There are two homestay options: a) includes \u201ccontinental\u201d breakfast and one hot meal (usually dinner) and b) access to the kitchen (buy your own food, cook your own meals and clean up afterwards). There are homestays that accept students with special dietary requirements and food allergies.     There is no kitchen access if you have a meal plan. If you choose to have kitchen rights over a meal plan, expect less interaction with your host family.   Requesting Roommates   All students who want to live with each other must specify this on the housing application, which will be made available to admitted students by the New York-based NYU Madrid site representative. If there are no doubles available students will be &quot;upgraded&quot; to a single. Keep in mind that few se\u00f1oras house two students in separate rooms.   Things to Know       Rooms are single or double occupancy with internet access     Shared bathrooms   You are encouraged to practice Spanish all the time, thus improving your language skills as well as immersing in the Spanish culture   If you choose to let your homestay provider cook for you, you get authentic Spanish homemade meals everyday   Included each week: two loads of wash; cleaning of your room; change of sheets/towel   Be respectful at all times as you are living in someone else's home   NYU Madrid will try to match you up as best as possible with your requested needs   Electricity and water are expensive in Spain. Students are encouraged to conserve energy by switching off lights when not using them and closing window blinds on hot days.                          Apartments     Apartments are not owned by NYU. They have been rented out by former students who have recommended them.   They are scattered throughout the city which also helps you get acquainted with the many neighborhoods of Madrid, which has an excellent public transportation system. Apartments are generally located in older buildings, not modern high-rises.   Please be aware that you are entering into a legal contract (duration of the full semester) when you sign the lease with the landlord. NYU is not involved in this agreement and is not able to break the lease on your behalf. Please be sure to read the Leases and Payments page . If you choose this option, please share this information with your parents.

Please keep in mind that furnished apartments in Madrid for short-term rentals are usually adequate and comfortable; they are not luxury apartments. Apartments are reserved based on availability and the landlord's discretion.   Meals   Students in apartments will have access to a kitchen. Students are responsible for their own meals and will either cook or eat out.   Requesting an Apartment   Students interested in living in an apartment may submit this choice when they complete the online housing preference system. Requesting an apartment used by a past student is not a guarantee for assignment. The NYU Madrid housing coordinator will match students to apartments that have been recommended but we cannot guarantee given the limited availability. However, some students will be assigned to a homestay.   Things to Know     Apartments can accommodate two, three and four people per unit   The vast majority of bedrooms are single rooms     Permission from the landlord is required for overnight guests   No parties allowed   The NYU Madrid housing coordinator serves as an intermediary between landlord and student                          General Room Details     Please be prepared for differences - remember you are not in the United States - so services and amenities you take for granted may not be available.              Bedrooms are considerably smaller than in the US   All accommodations include bed, desk, chair, and a closet in the bedroom as well as internet access     Bed sheets, pillows, towels, blankets, as well as dishes, kitchen utensils, pots and pans are provided   Washing machines, televisions, refrigerators, and microwaves are standard features    Air-conditioning is extremely rare                      NYU Global Housing License     Your signature on the student housing application, completion of the electronic application, or your acceptance of an assigned space or a room key, signifies your agreement to and acceptance of all of the terms of the NYU Global Housing License, including without limitation any provisions relating to meal plans, if applicable.

Under the Historical and Sustainable Architecture program, offered in conjunction with London\u2019s Sir John Soane Museum, students will study with British architects, designers, builders, and developers, who are leaders in the field of adaptive reuse and sustainable architecture.       \u201cIn an era when the demolition of older buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric, but also as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable,\u201d said Program Director Mosette Broderick, a clinical associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Art History and director of its Urban Design program. \u201cThis program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures.\u201d     In September, the first group of students will arrive in London for an academic year studying methods to effect the adaptive re-use of older buildings. The nine-month program will concentrate on solutions in the United Kingdom, which graduates will be able to translate to their home countries.       \u201cThe program relies on professionals who have successfully reused both important and modest older buildings, adapting them to new uses and integrating them into new projects built around, over, and even under historic structures,\u201d Broderick added. \u201cOur students will have the rare opportunity to study with these leading practitioners.\u201d       The curriculum extends sustainable practices beyond architecture and building into the realm of urban design. Students will examine successful strategies for reviving entire districts, cities, and regions around repurposed historic buildings in areas as diverse as the London Docklands and the older industrial regions of Germany.           \u201cThese examples suggest new possibilities for post-industrial, Rust Belt cities in the U.S., such as Buffalo and Cleveland, where the numerous historic buildings provide resources to be adapted for new uses, not liabilities to be demolished,\u201d Broderick observed.   The M.A. in Historical and Sustainable Architecture is the first academic program to unite the topics of sustainable architecture, adaptive reuse, and historic preservation within a single curriculum. Combining the multiple perspectives of finance, environmentalism, education, tourism, and government policy, this program will explore older buildings as assets to real estate development.

This will help you improve your Spanish language skills while being immersed in the rhythms of Madrile\u00f1o life.   Locations of homestays are scattered throughout the city which also helps you to get acquainted with the many neighborhoods (barrios) of Madrid as you navigate the excellent public transportation systems. Homestays are generally located in older buildings, not modern high-rises.                                    Click below to view Homestay Details                                                    Homestay Details                               Homestay providers are usually host mothers (se\u00f1oras) with comfortable accommodations whose children have moved away. We also have some nuclear families with children. In most cases the se\u00f1oras have hosted NYU students for many, many years.   Meals   There are two homestay options: a) includes \u201ccontinental\u201d breakfast and one hot meal (usually dinner) and b) access to the kitchen (buy your own food, cook your own meals and clean up afterwards). There are homestays that accept students with special dietary requirements and food allergies.     There is no kitchen access if you have a meal plan. If you choose to have kitchen rights over a meal plan, expect less interaction with your host family.   Requesting Roommates   All students who want to live with each other must specify this on the housing application, which will be made available to admitted students by the New York-based NYU Madrid site representative. If there are no doubles available students will be &quot;upgraded&quot; to a single. Keep in mind that few se\u00f1oras house two students in separate rooms.   Things to Know       Rooms are single or double occupancy with internet access     Shared bathrooms   You are encouraged to practice Spanish all the time, thus improving your language skills as well as immersing in the Spanish culture   If you choose to let your homestay provider cook for you, you get authentic Spanish homemade meals everyday   Included each week: two loads of wash; cleaning of your room; change of sheets/towel   Be respectful at all times as you are living in someone else's home   NYU Madrid will try to match you up as best as possible with your requested needs   Electricity and water are expensive in Spain. Students are encouraged to conserve energy by switching off lights when not using them and closing window blinds on hot days.                          Apartments     Apartments are not owned by NYU. They have been rented out by former students who have recommended them.   They are scattered throughout the city which also helps you get acquainted with the many neighborhoods of Madrid, which has an excellent public transportation system. Apartments are generally located in older buildings, not modern high-rises.   Please be aware that you are entering into a legal contract (duration of the full semester) when you sign the lease with the landlord. NYU is not involved in this agreement and is not able to break the lease on your behalf. Please be sure to read the Leases and Payments page .

Please keep in mind that furnished apartments in Madrid for short-term rentals are usually adequate and comfortable; they are not luxury apartments.

It is the first academic programme to unite the topics of sustainable architecture, adaptive reuse and historic preservation within a single curriculum.   Sponsored by the Urban Design and Architecture Studies programme of the Art History Department at New York University, the M.A. will benefit from the New York programme\u2019s tradition of interdisciplinary analysis and its broad, humanistic perspective on urban design. Uniting finance, environmentalism, education, tourism, and government policy, it will explore older buildings as assets to real estate development. The curriculum provides academic training and encourages students to find experiential learning opportunities.    British architects, designers, builders and developers are leaders in the field of adaptive reuse and sustainable architecture.For this reason, the programme is based in London, where our faculty consists of the city\u2019s innovative architects and designers. Working under restrictive historic protection orders, these designers have successfully reused both important and modest older buildings, adapting them to new uses and integrating them into new projects built around, over, and even under historic structures. Our students will have the rare opportunity to study with these leading practitioners.    We welcome a diverse student body, including recent American college graduates and young professionals, as well as applicants from other nations. Graduates will shape the urban environment as city planners, public administrators, non-profit advocates, public and private consultants, and real estate developers.

Student Reviews;   &quot;My favourite part of the program has been the experiences based on London's resources. It has been great to attend lectures by professionals working at the forefront of such a new field. It has been extreamly beneficial for our instructors to incorporate work from their practices and to demonstrate how what we are learning applies to areas, buildings and economies right now, in and around London.&quot;         &quot;The Independent Study program was exceptional in the education it provided. Through this course, we were able to tailor our lecture choices to our interests. The course provided us with a reason and an opportunity to venture into the architectural world. The information gathered from these lectures will be remembered and useful for the rest of my education&quot;                 Explore      Restaurants    Things to do    Local Travel    Regional Travel                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
