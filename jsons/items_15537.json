It offered me a further valuable perspective on the work I had been doing on environmental health and safety regulation and trade/competition. It provided a unique opportunity to discuss with academics their leading work on the implications of globalization. Whether their work was at a general level or on a specific subject, discussions were stimulating and relevant as Professors Kingsbury and Stewart focused the seminar on drawing parallels with and implications for students\u2019 work. The student work also covered a broad range of subjects and discussions allowed for cross-referencing of each other\u2019s work and that of the visiting academics.   Robert Yezerski (LL.B. \u201903, University of Sydney)   The great achievement of the Globalization and Its Discontents Colloquium is that it explores the common challenges that the phenomenon of globalization poses for regulatory fields as diverse as genetically modified foods, competition law, and international criminal law. The course focuses heavily on institutional design and explores the ways in which regulation may be achieved beyond the ordinary channels of international law and politics. Perhaps the best aspect of the colloquium is that it brings together a range of experts (from both inside and outside the Law School), exposing students to the leading scholarship in a diverse range of fields.   Students were required to prepare reaction papers to the various speakers, and most speakers spent considerable time discussing these responses during their presentations. This meant that students were able to engage the guest speakers directly, voicing their own perspectives, opinions, and objections. The overall experience of the colloquium was therefore one of collaboration and debate, rather than mere exposition. My colloquium paper proposed development of an international system of criminal liability for oil-tanker owners who violate environmental regulatory requirements.

This event is the first of four in the Democratizing the Green City event series .     New York\u2019s fame as a capital of sustainable urbanism keeps growing. With this continued growth, it is important to distinguish between genuine ecological enhancements and mere green marketing. To what extent have greening efforts in New York and other cities in the North and South served first and foremost as \u201cluxury ecologies\u201d, which improve the local environment at the cost of social displacement? What potential is there for urban greening to be anchored to social justice projects? In the context of global city development strategies, how much can grassroots struggles for ecological services like essential water and sanitation infrastructure achieve?    We seek to investigate these questions by exploring the link between ecological enhancement and social displacement across North and South, from Mumbai to New York, probing municipal policymakers\u2019 and grassroots activists\u2019 challenges and opportunities.    Julian Brash is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Monclair State University, is the author of the acclaimed Bloomberg\u2019s New York: Class and Governance in the Luxury City (2011). His current research focuses on the High Line and other new public parks in New York City.    Nikhil Anand is Assistant Professor of Geography, Environment and Society and the University of Minnesota and Associate of PUKAR (Partners for Urban Knowledge, Action, and Research), has written extensively in geography and anthropology on the political ecology of urban infrastructures and their social and material relations, with a focus on Mumbai.    Miriam Greenberg is Associate Professor of Sociology and Director of the Urban Studies Research Cluster at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is the author of Branding New York: How a City in Crisis was Sold to the World (2009). Her current research addresses the varying discourses and practices of \u201curban sustainability\u201d.    Following the speakers\u2019 opening remarks and a brief round of responses, the audience will join in a discussion moderated by Hillary Angelo , a PhD candidate in Sociology at NYU who has written extensively on urban political ecology, and whose dissertation tracks a century of urban greening in Germany\u2019s Ruhr region.     The Democratizing the Green City event series   is collaboration between IPK's Cities, Cultures, and Climate Change working group and the Urban Democracy Lab at Gallatin.
