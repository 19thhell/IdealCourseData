Dominick received his BS in Mechanical Engineering from NYU-Poly in 2013, and Flavia and Youngsu are PhD candidates in Mechanical Engineering at the University. Flavia will also receive a degree in Hydrology from Sapienza University in Rome through a joint degree program. Youngsu and Flavia are researchers in Prof. Maurizio Porfiri&#8217;s lab.    The Center&#8217;s Science of Smart Cities (SoSC) program may have wrapped up its latest run in August on NYU-Poly&#8217;s campus, but we are pleased to announce a new, international project centered on this initiative. \u00a0A team from NYU-Poly, along with the New York Academy of Science&#8217;s K12 outreach program , will travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia September 20 through October 3 to work with the National University of\u00a0Malaysia\u00a0(Universiti Kebangsaan\u00a0Malaysia\u00a0or UKM) .

At the end of the day we learned about new renewable resources like a hydrogen fuel cell. I did an activity in which\u00a0I demonstrated the workings of a hydrogen fuel cell. I used nickel plates placed in water connected to a battery. This created a reaction that seperated the H2O into H2 and O. The H2 is used to generate energy. This produces no harmful waste and is a efficient way to generate cleaner electricity. \u00a0 Continue reading\u00a0\u2192                        This entry was posted in Science of Smart Cities on July 11, 2013 by Ben Esner .

The goal for this trip is to adapt the Science of Smart Cities curriculum&#8217;s urban infrastructure, transportation, and wireless communications units for Malaysian high school students. In Malaysia, this adapted program is known as the Science of Smart Communities or\u00a0 Bitara STEM and this trip follows-up on the Center&#8217;s first trip last September.

Science of Smart Cities Travels to Malaysia                            Off to Malaysia: the Center&#8217;s Dominick Dennisur (L) with Flavia Tauro and Youngsu Cha. Dominick received his BS in Mechanical Engineering from NYU-Poly in 2013, and Flavia and Youngsu are PhD candidates in Mechanical Engineering at the University. Flavia will also receive a degree in Hydrology from Sapienza University in Rome through a joint degree program. Youngsu and Flavia are researchers in Prof. Maurizio Porfiri&#8217;s lab.    The Center&#8217;s Science of Smart Cities (SoSC) program may have wrapped up its latest run in August on NYU-Poly&#8217;s campus, but we are pleased to announce a new, international project centered on this initiative. \u00a0A team from NYU-Poly, along with the New York Academy of Science&#8217;s K12 outreach program , will travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia September 20 through October 3 to work with the National University of\u00a0Malaysia\u00a0(Universiti Kebangsaan\u00a0Malaysia\u00a0or UKM) . This global partnership adapts the SoSC curriculum and program for Malaysian middle school students and launches &#8220;The Science of Smart Communities&#8221;, or as it will be known in Malaysia, Bitara STEM .

NGC STEM professionals worked with NYU-Poly students to integrate its advanced wireless communication work for the City of New York into the SoSC curriculum. \u00a0As part of the program, middle school students spend a day at NGC with practicing engineers and technologists examining the real-world use of wireless technology in cities, learning how wireless networks are built and in workshops exploring creative applications that put the power of moving a lot of data around quickly to use in improving urban quality of life. \u00a0   To get research assist all people can apply website of coolessay.net/cheap_essays This website is not difficult to work with and very useful for college students   In case you are searching for professional essay writers website See Writercheap and find writercheap com All tasks and papers delivers on time   For my projects at college I need papercheap web site This is definitely good service of papercheap.co.uk Superior cost and rapid performing is supplied   buy targeted facebook fans with best price.

Renewable Resources Experiments                           Via David, a Brooklyn middle school student in NYU-Poly&#8217;s Science of Smart Cities program.   &#8230;Towards the end of the day,\u00a0I learned about power storage.\u00a0I learned that\u00a0I should save as much energy as possible and ways to improve our energy grid by incorporating network communication. At the end of the day we learned about new renewable resources like a hydrogen fuel cell. I did an activity in which\u00a0I demonstrated the workings of a hydrogen fuel cell. I used nickel plates placed in water connected to a battery. This created a reaction that seperated the H2O into H2 and O. The H2 is used to generate energy. This produces no harmful waste and is a efficient way to generate cleaner electricity. \u00a0 Continue reading\u00a0\u2192                        This entry was posted in Science of Smart Cities on July 11, 2013 by Ben Esner .
