Such changes may be of any nature, including, but not limited to, the elimination of programs, classes, or activities; the relocation or modification of the content of any of the foregoing; and the cancellation of scheduled classes or academic activities. Payment of tuition or attendance of any class shall constitute a student's acceptance of the administration\u2019s rights as set forth in the above paragraph.   The following academic policies and procedures are specific to noncredit students. Students should also review the schoolwide academic policies and procedures .            Expand All   Collapse All          Id Cards        NYU School of Professional Studies students enrolled in degree or diploma programs and declared professional certificate candidates are issued NYU photo ID cards. Noncredit students enrolled in courses, seminars, and conferences, or those with undeclared status in a certificate program, are issued a Building Access Pass that provides access to classroom buildings.   Replacements for lost NYU photo ID cards can be obtained at the NYU Card Center . One piece of photo ID is required to get a replacement card. The fees for replacements are $15 for the first replacement; $50 for the second; and $75 for the third.     More information on the NYUCard                 Arrears Policy        The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain.   Noncredit Grade Issuance   Grades are issued to students entirely by the faculty of record to provide a measurement of:     how much the student has learned of the delivered body of knowledge   how effectively the student is able to use that knowledge, and   other optional standards, such as class participation and, if essential to coursework, actual class attendance/lateness record (such attendance requirements are established by the faculty).     The grade finally awarded can also be influenced by other factors, such as:     whether the student\u2019s work is handed in by a clearly defined deadline   whether the student\u2019s work is complete and follows the directions of the assignment   the quality of grammar and composition   conformance to clearly defined coursework content specifications     All grading criteria should be completely explained by the instructor in the course syllabus, which will be either distributed or available for download from Blackboard at the beginning of the semester.               Grade Reporting        Instructors are to report test and project grades to students within one week of the work being handed in during the semester so that students are immediately aware of their performance in the course to date.   The University Registrar posts grades to student records by their student identification number (the student identification number, which begins with \u201cN,\u201d is printed on the student\u2019s course schedule) within four weeks of course completion. Final grades should be submitted by the faculty member for all students registered in continuing education courses within 72 hours of the last session of class, with the exception of R-prefixed courses (one-day seminars), which are not assigned grades.   A student may request, in writing to the instructor, a non-evaluative grade. A copy of this request must be filed with the department by the instructor.     Nonevaluative Grade Form           Students may also take courses on a Pass/Fail basis. A grade of P (Pass) does not count toward the completion of a professional certificate program.     Pass/Fail Request Form           In the case of extenuating circumstances, such as a serious illness or a family problem (this does not include work commitments or conflicts), and at the discretion of the instructor, an Incomplete Pass (IP) or Incomplete Fail (IF) may be granted, provided that the student has completed at least 50 percent of the coursework. This is subject to the instructor and student entering into a written agreement that details what must be completed for a grade to be issued and the deadline by which the work must be completed. The instructor or department has the authority to accept or deny a request for an Incomplete.     Incomplete Contract Form                 Obtaining Grades        Grades are posted throughout the semester as courses end. Students can access their grades online through ALBERT , NYU's web-based, university-wide student information system. To access ALBERT , you must have an activated NYU NetID. To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate your NetID using your University ID number. From any Internet-connected computer, go to the NYU Start page , enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome . Once your account is activated, go to NYUHome and sign in using your NetID and the password you chose. If you encounter a problem activating your NYUHome account, contact the ITS Client Services Helpline at (212) 998-3333 or e-mail askits@nyu.edu . After logging into NYUHome , click on the &quot;Academics&quot; tab and then click on &quot;Albert Login.&quot; Once in ALBERT, click on &quot;Student Center,&quot; and in the drop down menu on the left, choose &quot;Grades.&quot;   The Office of the University Registrar maintains individual records of students enrolled in the School's noncredit programs and is the only department authorized to record an official grade. An official transcript may be requested online or in writing by either faxing (212) 995-4154 or sending a signed letter to:   Transcripts, Office of the University Registrar  New York University, P.O. Box 910  New York, NY 10276-0910   Please note: Final grades are not mailed to students.               Change of Grade        Once recorded, grades cannot be changed unless some omission or error occurred in the grading process. If this occurs, the faculty of record must complete a change of grade on behalf of the student. Final grades are subject to revision by faculty with the approvals of the program director for one semester following the term in which the course was offered, except for approved IP/IF assigned grades. After one semester has elapsed, all grades recorded in the University Records Office, other than an IP/IF, become a permanent part of the academic record, and no changes are allowed. IP/IF grades may be changed up to one year from the date the grade was originally reported.               Noncredit Grade Review        A student may petition for a review of a grade only after he/she has made an objective review of his/her performance in the course. The grade review should be initiated and completed in a timely manner and no later than the immediate following term, whether the student takes classes or not.     The student initially requests of the instructor an explanation of a grade or evaluation. The student discusses any additional questions, determines if the faculty is willing to change the grade, and verifies that no calculation error has been made.   If the student is not satisfied and wishes to pursue the grade review process, the student submits a letter to the director of the program outlining any objections to the grade. The student should submit a copy of all documents to support the position of a grade change.     The director of the program will investigate and submit a written response to the student within 30 days of receiving the appeal with a final response. There is no other appeal. Please call (212) 998-7200 if you need more information regarding submitting a grade appeal.               Noncredit Courses and Continuing Education Units (CEUS)        Noncredit courses do not carry credit that can be applied toward an NYU degree. If you are unsure whether or not a course carries credit, please contact the appropriate department.   Just as credits have made it possible to carry degree work from one school to another, the CEU is used nationally to document the type, quality, and duration of continuing education work. A CEU is generally equal to 10 class hours (50-minute hours) in a course where grades are issued. To earn CEUs, the grade must be A, B, C, D, or Pass.   The NYU School of Professional Studies is a qualified sponsor for New Jersey Continuing Professional Education and holds a continuing education sponsor agreement with the New York State Department of Education, which authorizes the granting of continuing education credit in the following subject areas: accounting, auditing, taxation, advisory services, and specialized knowledge and applications related to specialized industries. Courses outside of these areas will not be recognized for credit under this agreement. For the acceptability of courses offered in Finance and Accounting; Law, Taxation, and Paralegal Studies; Architecture, Engineering, and Construction; and Real Estate, call (212) 998-7200.               Noncredit Changes, Withdrawals, and Refunds        Additions (added courses) to your noncredit program may be made by telephone, fax, mail, online, or in person.   Program changes (drop/adds) may be made via the Web, in person, or by fax.   Withdrawals: Students who wish to withdraw from, or for any reason find it impossible to complete a continuing education course should officially withdraw. Requests to withdraw from noncredit courses can be made online at any time at scps.nyu.edu/drop or up until one day before class starts via ALBERT , NYU\u2019s web-based, university-wide student information system. To access ALBERT , you must have an activated NYU NetID. To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate your NetID using your University ID number. From any Internet-connected computer, go to the NYU Start page, enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome . Once your account is activated, go to NYUHome and sign in using your NetID and the password you chose. If you encounter a problem activating your NYUHome account, contact the ITS Client Services Helpline at (212) 998-3333 or e-mail askits@nyu.edu . After logging into NYUHome , students click on the &quot;Academics&quot; tab and then click on &quot;Albert Login.&quot; Once in ALBERT, click on &quot;Student Center,&quot; and in the drop-down menu on the left, choose &quot;Enrollment: Drop.&quot;   Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. Cancellation of payment does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce indebtedness to the University; in this case, a penalty of $25 for late payment and $10 for stop-payment (subject to change without notice) must be charged. Students of any other NYU school must withdraw with their specific academic department.   Refund Policy: Refunds are computed based on the date and time the written or electronic notice of withdrawal is received by the Office of Noncredit Student Services. In addition, refunds for noncredit courses and seminars are based on the number of class sessions for the course that have met between start date of the course and withdrawal\u2014not by the number of sessions a student has attended.   Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle a student to a refund\u2014nor to a cancellation of tuition still due.   Students are eligible for a 100% tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date. The registration fee is nonrefundable.         If the class has already started, the refund schedule is as follows.   For noncredit courses (containing the designation &quot;CE&quot;) and seminars (containing the designation &quot;CS&quot;):     For courses with six or more sessions\u201475% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.   For courses with four or five sessions\u201460% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.   For courses with one to three sessions\u2014no refund is given after the first scheduled session.     For seminars that contain the designation &quot;CS&quot; and conferences containing the prefix &quot;SCPS&quot;: Procedures and policies for refunds vary by department.   For online courses: Refunds for online courses are calculated differently from on-site courses. Students are eligible for a 100 percent tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date. Students are eligible for a 60 percent tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before having logged into the course four times or within the first two weeks of the course. After the fourth login, or the second week, students are not eligible to receive any tuition refund for courses taken through the NYU School of Professional Studies.   For travel programs : Refunds for noncredit travel programs differ by department. Please note the specific policies for your program at the time of registration.               Discipline        NYU reserves the right to refuse enrollment in or admittance to any continuing education course to any student who engages in conduct deemed by the NYU School of Professional Studies, in its sole discretion, as interfering with the learning experience or safety of any person in the NYU community. Misconduct should be reported to the Office of Noncredit Student Services at (212) 998-7200. The Office of Noncredit Student Services will provide a referral to the appropriate academic director or administrator, who will hear the complaint and render a final decision. Laws prohibiting harassment on the basis of race, gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship status, or any other legally protected status are observed and enforced.   Students are expected to familiarize themselves and comply with academic regulations and established practices of the University and the NYU School of Professional Studies. If, pursuant to such regulations or practices, the withdrawal of a student is required before the end of the term for which tuition has been paid, a refund will be made according to the standard schedule for refunds.               Policy on Student Conduct        Introduction  Students enrolled in noncredit courses at the NYU School of Professional Studies can take advantage of the privileges afforded all members of the NYU academic community for the duration of their enrollment. This relationship gives rise to certain privileges, such as access to facilities and assistance from faculty members and staff, and imposes certain responsibilities, including complying with all applicable NYU rules and policies governing student conduct.   Policy Statement  Students enrolled in noncredit courses are expected to demonstrate appropriate professional and personal behavior in the classroom, on campus, on-site visits, at internships, and in other situations applicable to their role as NYU students. They are expected to practice civility and respect in their interactions with others in the University community; to abide by the principles of academic integrity; to represent honestly their noncredit status in the University; and to refrain from conducting themselves in ways that compromise the reputation, academic processes, or regular operations of the University.   Behavior subject to disciplinary action includes: behavior that violates University rules of conduct; the policies of the NYU School of Professional Studies ; any local, state, or federal laws; and conduct deemed by the School not to comply with the expectations described in this policy or interfering with the learning experience, safety, or well-being of any person in the NYU community, wherever any such behavior occurs. Examples of conduct that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, harassing students, faculty, and staff members; contributing to an unsafe environment; interfering with academic classes or events; disrupting University functions, programs, and activities; compromising the academic or administrative process by making excessive and unreasonable demands on faculty members or administrative staff; accessing or using NYU facilities or files (including electronic files) without authorization; jeopardizing the health, well-being, or safety of any member of the NYU community; causing damage to School or University facilities, property, or equipment; and the inappropriate use of University electronic services (e.g., running a business, public flaming, spamming, and any other form of electronic/e-mail harassment).   Disciplinary Sanctions  Students engaging in violations of this policy may be directed by the School's faculty or staff members to leave the classroom or other educational setting immediately. Any student determined by the head of the department to have engaged in violations of this policy shall be subject to the imposition of further sanctions, such as, but not limited to, suspension from the course for a stated period, dismissal from the course or program, prohibition from future enrollment, and notation on the student\u2019s record. The NYU School of Professional Studies shall have sole discretion in determining whether a violation of this policy has occurred. The student may request an appeal of the sanction, in writing, within seven (7) days of notice of the sanction. The divisional dean (or, if there is none, the associate dean for academic affairs) will review the appeal and render a decision, which shall be final and binding.                 For further information about the University-wide policies: http://www.nyu.edu/student.affairs/policies/   Registration Fees   For noncredit courses, the registration fee is either $10 or $20, depending on the total cost of the course or courses for which you register. If the total of your tuition is $99 or less, your registration fee is $10. If the total of your tuition is $100 or more, the fee is $20. The maximum $20 registration fee is payable only once each semester, no matter how many times you add courses. Registration fees are nonrefundable.   Note: This fee schedule does not apply to the programs requiring Credit Registration.               Reduced Rates for Older Adults        The NYU School of Professional Studies offers many courses to older adults at reduced rates. If you are 65 or older, you can receive a 25% discount on most noncredit courses (except where otherwise indicated). Reduced rates are not automatically applied. At the time of registration, the applicant must request the discount. Students requesting the Older Adult discount cannot register using the Web, and they may not use the Web to make a change of program. Reduced rates are not retroactively applied upon completion of the registration process. Proof of age (such as a Medicare card, driver\u2019s license, or passport) is required at in-person registration, and a copy of proof of age must be sent to the Office of Non-Credit Student Services if you are registering by telephone, fax, or mail. The reduced rate may not be used in conjunction with any other offer, and the highest discount prevails. The Older Adult discount does not apply to conferences and seminars that contain the designation &quot;CS&quot; and conferences (prefix &quot;SCPS&quot;), credit courses, or computer-lab based instruction.

Pass/Fail Request Form           In the case of extenuating circumstances, such as a serious illness or a family problem (this does not include work commitments or conflicts), and at the discretion of the instructor, an Incomplete Pass (IP) or Incomplete Fail (IF) may be granted, provided that the student has completed at least 50 percent of the coursework. This is subject to the instructor and student entering into a written agreement that details what must be completed for a grade to be issued and the deadline by which the work must be completed. The instructor or department has the authority to accept or deny a request for an Incomplete.     Incomplete Contract Form                 Obtaining Grades        Grades are posted throughout the semester as courses end. Students can access their grades online through ALBERT , NYU's web-based, university-wide student information system. To access ALBERT , you must have an activated NYU NetID. To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate your NetID using your University ID number. From any Internet-connected computer, go to the NYU Start page , enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome . Once your account is activated, go to NYUHome and sign in using your NetID and the password you chose. If you encounter a problem activating your NYUHome account, contact the ITS Client Services Helpline at (212) 998-3333 or e-mail askits@nyu.edu . After logging into NYUHome , click on the &quot;Academics&quot; tab and then click on &quot;Albert Login.&quot; Once in ALBERT, click on &quot;Student Center,&quot; and in the drop down menu on the left, choose &quot;Grades.&quot;   The Office of the University Registrar maintains individual records of students enrolled in the School's noncredit programs and is the only department authorized to record an official grade. An official transcript may be requested online or in writing by either faxing (212) 995-4154 or sending a signed letter to:   Transcripts, Office of the University Registrar  New York University, P.O. Box 910  New York, NY 10276-0910   Please note: Final grades are not mailed to students.               Change of Grade        Once recorded, grades cannot be changed unless some omission or error occurred in the grading process. If this occurs, the faculty of record must complete a change of grade on behalf of the student. Final grades are subject to revision by faculty with the approvals of the program director for one semester following the term in which the course was offered, except for approved IP/IF assigned grades. After one semester has elapsed, all grades recorded in the University Records Office, other than an IP/IF, become a permanent part of the academic record, and no changes are allowed. IP/IF grades may be changed up to one year from the date the grade was originally reported.               Noncredit Grade Review        A student may petition for a review of a grade only after he/she has made an objective review of his/her performance in the course. The grade review should be initiated and completed in a timely manner and no later than the immediate following term, whether the student takes classes or not.     The student initially requests of the instructor an explanation of a grade or evaluation. The student discusses any additional questions, determines if the faculty is willing to change the grade, and verifies that no calculation error has been made.   If the student is not satisfied and wishes to pursue the grade review process, the student submits a letter to the director of the program outlining any objections to the grade. The student should submit a copy of all documents to support the position of a grade change.     The director of the program will investigate and submit a written response to the student within 30 days of receiving the appeal with a final response. There is no other appeal. Please call (212) 998-7200 if you need more information regarding submitting a grade appeal.               Noncredit Courses and Continuing Education Units (CEUS)        Noncredit courses do not carry credit that can be applied toward an NYU degree. If you are unsure whether or not a course carries credit, please contact the appropriate department.   Just as credits have made it possible to carry degree work from one school to another, the CEU is used nationally to document the type, quality, and duration of continuing education work. A CEU is generally equal to 10 class hours (50-minute hours) in a course where grades are issued. To earn CEUs, the grade must be A, B, C, D, or Pass.   The NYU School of Professional Studies is a qualified sponsor for New Jersey Continuing Professional Education and holds a continuing education sponsor agreement with the New York State Department of Education, which authorizes the granting of continuing education credit in the following subject areas: accounting, auditing, taxation, advisory services, and specialized knowledge and applications related to specialized industries. Courses outside of these areas will not be recognized for credit under this agreement. For the acceptability of courses offered in Finance and Accounting; Law, Taxation, and Paralegal Studies; Architecture, Engineering, and Construction; and Real Estate, call (212) 998-7200.               Noncredit Changes, Withdrawals, and Refunds        Additions (added courses) to your noncredit program may be made by telephone, fax, mail, online, or in person.   Program changes (drop/adds) may be made via the Web, in person, or by fax.   Withdrawals: Students who wish to withdraw from, or for any reason find it impossible to complete a continuing education course should officially withdraw. Requests to withdraw from noncredit courses can be made online at any time at scps.nyu.edu/drop or up until one day before class starts via ALBERT , NYU\u2019s web-based, university-wide student information system. To access ALBERT , you must have an activated NYU NetID. To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate your NetID using your University ID number. From any Internet-connected computer, go to the NYU Start page, enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome . Once your account is activated, go to NYUHome and sign in using your NetID and the password you chose. If you encounter a problem activating your NYUHome account, contact the ITS Client Services Helpline at (212) 998-3333 or e-mail askits@nyu.edu . After logging into NYUHome , students click on the &quot;Academics&quot; tab and then click on &quot;Albert Login.&quot; Once in ALBERT, click on &quot;Student Center,&quot; and in the drop-down menu on the left, choose &quot;Enrollment: Drop.&quot;   Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. Cancellation of payment does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce indebtedness to the University; in this case, a penalty of $25 for late payment and $10 for stop-payment (subject to change without notice) must be charged. Students of any other NYU school must withdraw with their specific academic department.   Refund Policy: Refunds are computed based on the date and time the written or electronic notice of withdrawal is received by the Office of Noncredit Student Services. In addition, refunds for noncredit courses and seminars are based on the number of class sessions for the course that have met between start date of the course and withdrawal\u2014not by the number of sessions a student has attended.   Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle a student to a refund\u2014nor to a cancellation of tuition still due.   Students are eligible for a 100% tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date. The registration fee is nonrefundable.         If the class has already started, the refund schedule is as follows.   For noncredit courses (containing the designation &quot;CE&quot;) and seminars (containing the designation &quot;CS&quot;):     For courses with six or more sessions\u201475% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.   For courses with four or five sessions\u201460% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.   For courses with one to three sessions\u2014no refund is given after the first scheduled session.     For seminars that contain the designation &quot;CS&quot; and conferences containing the prefix &quot;SCPS&quot;: Procedures and policies for refunds vary by department.   For online courses: Refunds for online courses are calculated differently from on-site courses. Students are eligible for a 100 percent tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date. Students are eligible for a 60 percent tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before having logged into the course four times or within the first two weeks of the course. After the fourth login, or the second week, students are not eligible to receive any tuition refund for courses taken through the NYU School of Professional Studies.   For travel programs : Refunds for noncredit travel programs differ by department. Please note the specific policies for your program at the time of registration.               Discipline        NYU reserves the right to refuse enrollment in or admittance to any continuing education course to any student who engages in conduct deemed by the NYU School of Professional Studies, in its sole discretion, as interfering with the learning experience or safety of any person in the NYU community. Misconduct should be reported to the Office of Noncredit Student Services at (212) 998-7200. The Office of Noncredit Student Services will provide a referral to the appropriate academic director or administrator, who will hear the complaint and render a final decision. Laws prohibiting harassment on the basis of race, gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship status, or any other legally protected status are observed and enforced.   Students are expected to familiarize themselves and comply with academic regulations and established practices of the University and the NYU School of Professional Studies. If, pursuant to such regulations or practices, the withdrawal of a student is required before the end of the term for which tuition has been paid, a refund will be made according to the standard schedule for refunds.               Policy on Student Conduct        Introduction  Students enrolled in noncredit courses at the NYU School of Professional Studies can take advantage of the privileges afforded all members of the NYU academic community for the duration of their enrollment. This relationship gives rise to certain privileges, such as access to facilities and assistance from faculty members and staff, and imposes certain responsibilities, including complying with all applicable NYU rules and policies governing student conduct.   Policy Statement  Students enrolled in noncredit courses are expected to demonstrate appropriate professional and personal behavior in the classroom, on campus, on-site visits, at internships, and in other situations applicable to their role as NYU students. They are expected to practice civility and respect in their interactions with others in the University community; to abide by the principles of academic integrity; to represent honestly their noncredit status in the University; and to refrain from conducting themselves in ways that compromise the reputation, academic processes, or regular operations of the University.   Behavior subject to disciplinary action includes: behavior that violates University rules of conduct; the policies of the NYU School of Professional Studies ; any local, state, or federal laws; and conduct deemed by the School not to comply with the expectations described in this policy or interfering with the learning experience, safety, or well-being of any person in the NYU community, wherever any such behavior occurs. Examples of conduct that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, harassing students, faculty, and staff members; contributing to an unsafe environment; interfering with academic classes or events; disrupting University functions, programs, and activities; compromising the academic or administrative process by making excessive and unreasonable demands on faculty members or administrative staff; accessing or using NYU facilities or files (including electronic files) without authorization; jeopardizing the health, well-being, or safety of any member of the NYU community; causing damage to School or University facilities, property, or equipment; and the inappropriate use of University electronic services (e.g., running a business, public flaming, spamming, and any other form of electronic/e-mail harassment).   Disciplinary Sanctions  Students engaging in violations of this policy may be directed by the School's faculty or staff members to leave the classroom or other educational setting immediately. Any student determined by the head of the department to have engaged in violations of this policy shall be subject to the imposition of further sanctions, such as, but not limited to, suspension from the course for a stated period, dismissal from the course or program, prohibition from future enrollment, and notation on the student\u2019s record. The NYU School of Professional Studies shall have sole discretion in determining whether a violation of this policy has occurred. The student may request an appeal of the sanction, in writing, within seven (7) days of notice of the sanction. The divisional dean (or, if there is none, the associate dean for academic affairs) will review the appeal and render a decision, which shall be final and binding.                 For further information about the University-wide policies: http://www.nyu.edu/student.affairs/policies/   Registration Fees   For noncredit courses, the registration fee is either $10 or $20, depending on the total cost of the course or courses for which you register. If the total of your tuition is $99 or less, your registration fee is $10. If the total of your tuition is $100 or more, the fee is $20. The maximum $20 registration fee is payable only once each semester, no matter how many times you add courses. Registration fees are nonrefundable.   Note: This fee schedule does not apply to the programs requiring Credit Registration.               Reduced Rates for Older Adults        The NYU School of Professional Studies offers many courses to older adults at reduced rates. If you are 65 or older, you can receive a 25% discount on most noncredit courses (except where otherwise indicated). Reduced rates are not automatically applied. At the time of registration, the applicant must request the discount. Students requesting the Older Adult discount cannot register using the Web, and they may not use the Web to make a change of program. Reduced rates are not retroactively applied upon completion of the registration process. Proof of age (such as a Medicare card, driver\u2019s license, or passport) is required at in-person registration, and a copy of proof of age must be sent to the Office of Non-Credit Student Services if you are registering by telephone, fax, or mail. The reduced rate may not be used in conjunction with any other offer, and the highest discount prevails. The Older Adult discount does not apply to conferences and seminars that contain the designation &quot;CS&quot; and conferences (prefix &quot;SCPS&quot;), credit courses, or computer-lab based instruction.

Such changes may be of any nature, including, but not limited to, the elimination of programs, classes, or activities; the relocation or modification of the content of any of the foregoing; and the cancellation of scheduled classes or academic activities. Payment of tuition or attendance of any class shall constitute a student's acceptance of the administration\u2019s rights as set forth in the above paragraph.   The following academic policies and procedures are specific to noncredit students. Students should also review the schoolwide academic policies and procedures .            Expand All   Collapse All          Id Cards        NYU School of Professional Studies students enrolled in degree or diploma programs and declared professional certificate candidates are issued NYU photo ID cards. Noncredit students enrolled in courses, seminars, and conferences, or those with undeclared status in a certificate program, are issued a Building Access Pass that provides access to classroom buildings.   Replacements for lost NYU photo ID cards can be obtained at the NYU Card Center . One piece of photo ID is required to get a replacement card. The fees for replacements are $15 for the first replacement; $50 for the second; and $75 for the third.     More information on the NYUCard                 Arrears Policy        The University reserves the right to deny registration and withhold information regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of tuition, fees, loans, or other charges (including charges for housing, dining, or other activities or services) for as long as any arrears remain.   Noncredit Grade Issuance   Grades are issued to students entirely by the faculty of record to provide a measurement of:     how much the student has learned of the delivered body of knowledge   how effectively the student is able to use that knowledge, and   other optional standards, such as class participation and, if essential to coursework, actual class attendance/lateness record (such attendance requirements are established by the faculty).     The grade finally awarded can also be influenced by other factors, such as:     whether the student\u2019s work is handed in by a clearly defined deadline   whether the student\u2019s work is complete and follows the directions of the assignment   the quality of grammar and composition   conformance to clearly defined coursework content specifications     All grading criteria should be completely explained by the instructor in the course syllabus, which will be either distributed or available for download from Blackboard at the beginning of the semester.               Grade Reporting        Instructors are to report test and project grades to students within one week of the work being handed in during the semester so that students are immediately aware of their performance in the course to date.   The University Registrar posts grades to student records by their student identification number (the student identification number, which begins with \u201cN,\u201d is printed on the student\u2019s course schedule) within four weeks of course completion. Final grades should be submitted by the faculty member for all students registered in continuing education courses within 72 hours of the last session of class, with the exception of R-prefixed courses (one-day seminars), which are not assigned grades.   A student may request, in writing to the instructor, a non-evaluative grade. A copy of this request must be filed with the department by the instructor.     Nonevaluative Grade Form           Students may also take courses on a Pass/Fail basis. A grade of P (Pass) does not count toward the completion of a professional certificate program.     Pass/Fail Request Form           In the case of extenuating circumstances, such as a serious illness or a family problem (this does not include work commitments or conflicts), and at the discretion of the instructor, an Incomplete Pass (IP) or Incomplete Fail (IF) may be granted, provided that the student has completed at least 50 percent of the coursework. This is subject to the instructor and student entering into a written agreement that details what must be completed for a grade to be issued and the deadline by which the work must be completed. The instructor or department has the authority to accept or deny a request for an Incomplete.     Incomplete Contract Form                 Obtaining Grades        Grades are posted throughout the semester as courses end. Students can access their grades online through ALBERT , NYU's web-based, university-wide student information system. To access ALBERT , you must have an activated NYU NetID. To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate your NetID using your University ID number. From any Internet-connected computer, go to the NYU Start page , enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome . Once your account is activated, go to NYUHome and sign in using your NetID and the password you chose. If you encounter a problem activating your NYUHome account, contact the ITS Client Services Helpline at (212) 998-3333 or e-mail askits@nyu.edu . After logging into NYUHome , click on the &quot;Academics&quot; tab and then click on &quot;Albert Login.&quot; Once in ALBERT, click on &quot;Student Center,&quot; and in the drop down menu on the left, choose &quot;Grades.&quot;   The Office of the University Registrar maintains individual records of students enrolled in the School's noncredit programs and is the only department authorized to record an official grade. An official transcript may be requested online or in writing by either faxing (212) 995-4154 or sending a signed letter to:   Transcripts, Office of the University Registrar  New York University, P.O. Box 910  New York, NY 10276-0910   Please note: Final grades are not mailed to students.               Change of Grade        Once recorded, grades cannot be changed unless some omission or error occurred in the grading process. If this occurs, the faculty of record must complete a change of grade on behalf of the student. Final grades are subject to revision by faculty with the approvals of the program director for one semester following the term in which the course was offered, except for approved IP/IF assigned grades. After one semester has elapsed, all grades recorded in the University Records Office, other than an IP/IF, become a permanent part of the academic record, and no changes are allowed. IP/IF grades may be changed up to one year from the date the grade was originally reported.               Noncredit Grade Review        A student may petition for a review of a grade only after he/she has made an objective review of his/her performance in the course. The grade review should be initiated and completed in a timely manner and no later than the immediate following term, whether the student takes classes or not.     The student initially requests of the instructor an explanation of a grade or evaluation. The student discusses any additional questions, determines if the faculty is willing to change the grade, and verifies that no calculation error has been made.   If the student is not satisfied and wishes to pursue the grade review process, the student submits a letter to the director of the program outlining any objections to the grade. The student should submit a copy of all documents to support the position of a grade change.     The director of the program will investigate and submit a written response to the student within 30 days of receiving the appeal with a final response. There is no other appeal. Please call (212) 998-7200 if you need more information regarding submitting a grade appeal.               Noncredit Courses and Continuing Education Units (CEUS)        Noncredit courses do not carry credit that can be applied toward an NYU degree. If you are unsure whether or not a course carries credit, please contact the appropriate department.   Just as credits have made it possible to carry degree work from one school to another, the CEU is used nationally to document the type, quality, and duration of continuing education work. A CEU is generally equal to 10 class hours (50-minute hours) in a course where grades are issued. To earn CEUs, the grade must be A, B, C, D, or Pass.   The NYU School of Professional Studies is a qualified sponsor for New Jersey Continuing Professional Education and holds a continuing education sponsor agreement with the New York State Department of Education, which authorizes the granting of continuing education credit in the following subject areas: accounting, auditing, taxation, advisory services, and specialized knowledge and applications related to specialized industries. Courses outside of these areas will not be recognized for credit under this agreement. For the acceptability of courses offered in Finance and Accounting; Law, Taxation, and Paralegal Studies; Architecture, Engineering, and Construction; and Real Estate, call (212) 998-7200.               Noncredit Changes, Withdrawals, and Refunds        Additions (added courses) to your noncredit program may be made by telephone, fax, mail, online, or in person.   Program changes (drop/adds) may be made via the Web, in person, or by fax.   Withdrawals: Students who wish to withdraw from, or for any reason find it impossible to complete a continuing education course should officially withdraw. Requests to withdraw from noncredit courses can be made online at any time at scps.nyu.edu/drop or up until one day before class starts via ALBERT , NYU\u2019s web-based, university-wide student information system. To access ALBERT , you must have an activated NYU NetID. To access your NYUHome account for the first time, you will need to activate your NetID using your University ID number. From any Internet-connected computer, go to the NYU Start page, enter your NetID, and follow the instructions to set up a password and access NYUHome . Once your account is activated, go to NYUHome and sign in using your NetID and the password you chose. If you encounter a problem activating your NYUHome account, contact the ITS Client Services Helpline at (212) 998-3333 or e-mail askits@nyu.edu . After logging into NYUHome , students click on the &quot;Academics&quot; tab and then click on &quot;Albert Login.&quot; Once in ALBERT, click on &quot;Student Center,&quot; and in the drop-down menu on the left, choose &quot;Enrollment: Drop.&quot;   Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. Cancellation of payment does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce indebtedness to the University; in this case, a penalty of $25 for late payment and $10 for stop-payment (subject to change without notice) must be charged. Students of any other NYU school must withdraw with their specific academic department.   Refund Policy: Refunds are computed based on the date and time the written or electronic notice of withdrawal is received by the Office of Noncredit Student Services. In addition, refunds for noncredit courses and seminars are based on the number of class sessions for the course that have met between start date of the course and withdrawal\u2014not by the number of sessions a student has attended.   Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle a student to a refund\u2014nor to a cancellation of tuition still due.   Students are eligible for a 100% tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date. The registration fee is nonrefundable.         If the class has already started, the refund schedule is as follows.   For noncredit courses (containing the designation &quot;CE&quot;) and seminars (containing the designation &quot;CS&quot;):     For courses with six or more sessions\u201475% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.   For courses with four or five sessions\u201460% refund if the student withdraws before the third scheduled session. No refund thereafter.   For courses with one to three sessions\u2014no refund is given after the first scheduled session.     For seminars that contain the designation &quot;CS&quot; and conferences containing the prefix &quot;SCPS&quot;: Procedures and policies for refunds vary by department.   For online courses: Refunds for online courses are calculated differently from on-site courses. Students are eligible for a 100 percent tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before the official start date. Students are eligible for a 60 percent tuition refund if they withdraw from the course before having logged into the course four times or within the first two weeks of the course. After the fourth login, or the second week, students are not eligible to receive any tuition refund for courses taken through the NYU School of Professional Studies.   For travel programs : Refunds for noncredit travel programs differ by department. Please note the specific policies for your program at the time of registration.               Discipline        NYU reserves the right to refuse enrollment in or admittance to any continuing education course to any student who engages in conduct deemed by the NYU School of Professional Studies, in its sole discretion, as interfering with the learning experience or safety of any person in the NYU community. Misconduct should be reported to the Office of Noncredit Student Services at (212) 998-7200. The Office of Noncredit Student Services will provide a referral to the appropriate academic director or administrator, who will hear the complaint and render a final decision. Laws prohibiting harassment on the basis of race, gender, color, religion, age, national origin, ethnicity, disability, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship status, or any other legally protected status are observed and enforced.   Students are expected to familiarize themselves and comply with academic regulations and established practices of the University and the NYU School of Professional Studies. If, pursuant to such regulations or practices, the withdrawal of a student is required before the end of the term for which tuition has been paid, a refund will be made according to the standard schedule for refunds.               Policy on Student Conduct        Introduction  Students enrolled in noncredit courses at the NYU School of Professional Studies can take advantage of the privileges afforded all members of the NYU academic community for the duration of their enrollment. This relationship gives rise to certain privileges, such as access to facilities and assistance from faculty members and staff, and imposes certain responsibilities, including complying with all applicable NYU rules and policies governing student conduct.   Policy Statement  Students enrolled in noncredit courses are expected to demonstrate appropriate professional and personal behavior in the classroom, on campus, on-site visits, at internships, and in other situations applicable to their role as NYU students. They are expected to practice civility and respect in their interactions with others in the University community; to abide by the principles of academic integrity; to represent honestly their noncredit status in the University; and to refrain from conducting themselves in ways that compromise the reputation, academic processes, or regular operations of the University.   Behavior subject to disciplinary action includes: behavior that violates University rules of conduct; the policies of the NYU School of Professional Studies ; any local, state, or federal laws; and conduct deemed by the School not to comply with the expectations described in this policy or interfering with the learning experience, safety, or well-being of any person in the NYU community, wherever any such behavior occurs. Examples of conduct that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, harassing students, faculty, and staff members; contributing to an unsafe environment; interfering with academic classes or events; disrupting University functions, programs, and activities; compromising the academic or administrative process by making excessive and unreasonable demands on faculty members or administrative staff; accessing or using NYU facilities or files (including electronic files) without authorization; jeopardizing the health, well-being, or safety of any member of the NYU community; causing damage to School or University facilities, property, or equipment; and the inappropriate use of University electronic services (e.g., running a business, public flaming, spamming, and any other form of electronic/e-mail harassment).   Disciplinary Sanctions  Students engaging in violations of this policy may be directed by the School's faculty or staff members to leave the classroom or other educational setting immediately. Any student determined by the head of the department to have engaged in violations of this policy shall be subject to the imposition of further sanctions, such as, but not limited to, suspension from the course for a stated period, dismissal from the course or program, prohibition from future enrollment, and notation on the student\u2019s record. The NYU School of Professional Studies shall have sole discretion in determining whether a violation of this policy has occurred. The student may request an appeal of the sanction, in writing, within seven (7) days of notice of the sanction. The divisional dean (or, if there is none, the associate dean for academic affairs) will review the appeal and render a decision, which shall be final and binding.                 For further information about the University-wide policies: http://www.nyu.edu/student.affairs/policies/   Registration Fees   For noncredit courses, the registration fee is either $10 or $20, depending on the total cost of the course or courses for which you register. If the total of your tuition is $99 or less, your registration fee is $10. If the total of your tuition is $100 or more, the fee is $20. The maximum $20 registration fee is payable only once each semester, no matter how many times you add courses. Registration fees are nonrefundable.   Note: This fee schedule does not apply to the programs requiring Credit Registration.               Reduced Rates for Older Adults        The NYU School of Professional Studies offers many courses to older adults at reduced rates. If you are 65 or older, you can receive a 25% discount on most noncredit courses (except where otherwise indicated). Reduced rates are not automatically applied. At the time of registration, the applicant must request the discount. Students requesting the Older Adult discount cannot register using the Web, and they may not use the Web to make a change of program. Reduced rates are not retroactively applied upon completion of the registration process. Proof of age (such as a Medicare card, driver\u2019s license, or passport) is required at in-person registration, and a copy of proof of age must be sent to the Office of Non-Credit Student Services if you are registering by telephone, fax, or mail. The reduced rate may not be used in conjunction with any other offer, and the highest discount prevails. The Older Adult discount does not apply to conferences and seminars that contain the designation &quot;CS&quot; and conferences (prefix &quot;SCPS&quot;), credit courses, or computer-lab based instruction.
