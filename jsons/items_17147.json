Among other techniques, ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) are discussed. UGWs offer large monitoring ranges compared to ultrasounds maintaining good sensitivity from a single probe position with the complete coverage of the waveguide cross-section. Compared to global vibrations, often employed for SHM, guided waves provide increased sensitivity to smaller defects due to the larger frequencies. However, these advantages can be fully exploited only once the complexities of guided wave propagation are unveiled for the given test structure. UGWs are useful at the component level but global approaches (for instance based on global vibration) are needed when the understanding of larger systems is necessary.   The seminar will focus on numerical predictions of dynamic vibration in complex structural components and results of several experimental and field tests performed by the author. Numerical simulations are based on a Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method. This approach can also be coupled with Boundary Elements to account for leakage induced attenuation. The numerical approach is able to model wave properties (such as speed and attenuation) in waveguides of arbitrary cross-section, with a large number of layers and accounting for viscoelastic material damping. These solutions are essential in the interpretation of experimental results and are necessary to develop a Structural Health Monitoring strategy based on Guided Waves.   Some relevant applications are presented such as defect detection in railroad tracks, stress monitoring and damage detection in concrete bridge structural components and impact location/identification in composite structural components. Finally, the talk includes also additional NDE and SHM activities currently conducted by the presenter.   ________________________________________   Biosketch   Ivan Bartoli received his Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Bologna, Italy in 2001, where he worked until 2002 as a researcher.
