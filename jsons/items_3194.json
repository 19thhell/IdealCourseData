In the new location, students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural, artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood, as well as to get to know the city through faculty-led visits and walking tours. The program offers regular day trips to places outside of the city, such as Chantilly, Giverny, and Versailles, and weekend excursions to locations that have included Avignon, the Loire Valley, Mont-Saint-Michel, and La Rochelle. These trips allow students to further embrace the richness, depth, and diversity of French history and civilization.

Students with a limited background in French enroll in Program I, where all courses except for language are taught in English. Students proficient in French participate in Program II, which features a variety of courses taught in French. All students take a French language course appropriate to their level.   Coursework is enhanced by faculty-led trips in and around Paris, to world-renowned museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e Picasso or to smaller galleries and exhibits, as well as to the opera, ballet, and theatre. Students receive a University of Paris student card and may take courses at the University of Paris or at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques (Sciences Po).
