Our mission is to teach every medical student to practice medicine with compassion, intellectual discipline, lifelong curiosity and professionalism. To achieve this, the Department plays a vital role in each of the four years of medical school.   During the first 18 months of medical school, students take two courses, Foundations of Medicine and Practice of Medicine, which are vital to this mission. The Practice of Medicine (POM) course consists of three elements: Introduction to Bedside Diagnosis (IBD), Patient Longitudinal Ambulatory Care Experience (PLACE), and Patient Physician and Society (PPS). The Foundations of Medicine (FOM) course provides students with newly organized organ-based modules that introduce clinically relevant basic scientific principles. All of the leadership and more than 80% of faculty for these courses are members of the Department of Medicine. The Department is also directly responsible for four of the nine clerkships: Medicine, Ambulatory Care, Critical Care, and Advanced Medicine. These clerkships rely on supervised patient care responsibility that fosters the development of each student into a mature and professional clinician.      The implementation of The Curriculum for the 21st Century (C21) has expanded the Department of Medicine\u2019s teaching roles. In addition to a large number of electives, the Department offers four newly organized \u201cSelectives\u201d in Cardiology, Palliative Care, Health Policy, and Global Health. Each selective is designed to be more rigorous than traditional electives. The Department is also at the forefront of developing innovative interdepartmental curricula, and holds leadership positions in every newly developed \u201cPillar\u201d (a pillar is a core topic such as colon cancer that is revisited multiple times during the career of each student) and the \u201cintersessions\u201d (one week courses that students take between clerkship blocks).      \u00a0   Students also have the opportunity to participate in research with mentoring departmental faculty members. Sometimes their participation is limited to summer projects, but in many cases their research activities continue beyond that period, as, for instance, in fulfillment of the Honors Program requirement for an eighteen week commitment. The Department also provides a mentor to all students who wish to have a career in medicine during the residency application process.      The Department is continually reassessing and improving its teaching programs during the monthly Education Council Meetings. With the ongoing efforts to implement C21 and all future challenges, the faculty members of the Department of Medicine are dedicated to training future generations of physicians.

Critical to learning cultural competency is an experiential, hands-on approach in a clinical community setting.      Practice of Medicine     The POM module establishes a patient-centered program and continuity of care forum that will facilitate learner-centered anchoring of mechanisms of disease principles in conjunction with the development of culturally competent clinical skills.      P.L.A.C.E. Program     The goals of PLACE within the Practice of Medicine module are to provide students a clinical site in which they learn about clinical medicine and interdisciplinary care while developing a patient panel that they can follow at various venues overa a longitudinal period.
