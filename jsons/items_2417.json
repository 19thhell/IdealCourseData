The Guide covers the different disciplines that fall under the umbrella of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. Use the tabs above for information about specific types of resources.   A General Overview of the Collection   Bobst Library&rsquo;s collection of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies consists of approximately 300,000 volumes in various European languages as well as Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Ottoman Turkish. The collections main strengths are the history of the Arab Middle East, Arabic and Persian literatures, Islamic Law and Turkish and Ottoman Studies. In addition to the print volumes, the library is subscribed to a large number of electronic databases and resources that can be used by the NYU community globally. With its online Afghanistan Digital Library and its participation in the Arabic Collection Online (ACO), Bobst Library is also a leading institution in the digital humanities in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. The online Afghanistan Digital Library project digitizes books printed in Afghanistan between 1930 and 1971 and makes this material available to readers world-wide. The ACO is a collaborative project of several research libraries (Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, the American University in Beirut, and NYU) that intends to create an open-access digital database of 7,000 Arabic books that were published over the course of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries.   Bobst library also holds a sizeable collection of Middle Eastern movies and sound recordings. In addition, the library houses (at the Tamiment Library) the Shaheen Collection , the largest collection in the country on the representation of Arabs and Muslims in American popular culture.                                                       Transliteration/Romanization                 All the bibliographic entries in Bobcat are Romanized. More recent entries have in addition to the Romanized fields parallel fields in the vernacular scripts.   While the Romanization of Arabic is fairly standardized both in terms of vowels and consonants, the Romanization of Ottoman Turkish , Persian and other Middle Eastern and Islamic languages is much less so (especially as far as the vocalization is concerned).   When searching in Arabic, note that t he taa marbuta is transliterated as h in non-compound nouns ( sirah, nubuwwah ). The &ndash;yya suffix is transliterated as &ndash; iyah .  Also note that the  masculine possessive suffix is not vocalized and appears as h.   It is advisable not to skip the stop words in Arabic like ( min, il&aacute;, &lsquo;l&aacute;) from title search. You can skip them from Keyword search. As for waw - it is advisable to be separated with a space from the word if the word includes al-ta'rif.

Sir\u0101j al-taw\u0101r\u012bkh or The History of Afghanistan was commissioned as an official national history by the Afghan prince, later amir, Habib Allah Khan (reigned 1901-1919). The author, Fayz Muhammad Khan, better known as &ldquo;Katib&rdquo; (The Writer), was a scribe at the royal court. For more than twenty years, he had full access to government archives and oral sources and thus presents an unparalleled picture of the country from its founding in 1747 until the end of the nineteenth century. The roots of much of the fabric of Afghanistan&rsquo;s society today&mdash;tribe and state relations, the rule of law, gender issues, and the economy&mdash;are elegantly and minutely detailed in this immense work.

Most of the places depicted are within the boundaries of modern-day Turkey, but buildings and sites in Iraq, Lebanon, Greece and other countries are also included.   The American University of Beirut Jafet Library's Poster Collection   Arab Image F oundation   Archnet is a globally-accessible, intellectual resource focused on architecture, urbanism, environmental and landscape design, visual culture, and conservation issues related to the Muslim world. Archnet&rsquo;s mission is to provide ready access to unique visual and textual material to facilitate teaching, scholarship, and professional work of high quality. Officially launched in 2002 as a partnership between the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Archnet has since evolved into the largest open, online architectural library with a focus on Muslim cultures. Its digital archives form a comprehensive resource on architecture, urban design, landscape, development, and related issues. Archnet provides a bridge for interested persons to learn how to enhance the quality of the built environment, to compensate for lack of resources for students and faculty in academic institutions, and to highlight the culture and traditions of Islam.
