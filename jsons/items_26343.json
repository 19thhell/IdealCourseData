The opening measures reval the clarity of the structure, the theme being stated as an arpeggiation of the tonic G Major triad in second inversions, being answered by the argpeggiation of the dominant sevent in root position. The theme itself is a co,plex structure made up of simple structures. Measures 1-10 are a contrasting period form with a two measure extension coupled to a parallel period form (mm. 11-18). The cadence at measure 18 serves as the end of the second period form and the beginning of the transition (mm. 18-27) to the dominant to prepare for the second theme. Notice how the textures provide contrast within this highly unified statement of the theme: the first four measures are unison with rests creating an openness to the texture, the next four plus extension use a contrasting interation of a g-pedal tone and steady, connected and rhythmically vital eighth-note activity. The second half of the theme begins with a legao duo in the upper strings with imitation in the lower voices, and the transition to the dominant is based on the texture and material presented in measures 5-10.   In this opening passage (the first half of the Exposition) the classical ideals of balance, symmetry, clarity, contrast, restraint, moderation, proportion, and form are revealed. Notice how the contrasting sections of texture tend to balance each other. The symmetry of period form is the basic organizing force, the two period forms are joined to form a double period form for the structure of the first theme. Mozart avoids the predictability of this symmetry through the use of the extension and using an elision (the end of a section serving as the beginning of the next). Even at its most robust statement (the opening measures and the transition), the energy is restrained, contained within the limits of moderation. There is nothing to excess here.     By clicking on the first page, you can listen to the first movement of this very popular classical work. It is a testament to the work that with all of its performances and recordings, the music remains refresh and vital, a true test of a \"classic\" in the more popular use of the term.   Each movement of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik provides a microcosm of style and form of the late 18th Century musical style. The first movement is exemplary of sonata allegro form, with themes that are extraordinary in their structure, each serving to balance the contrasting thematic material. The development is concise, but highly concentrated, and the recapitulation with the codetta closes the movement. The second movement combines theme and variations with elements of Rondo ultimately encased in a large ABA song form with the B section providing a dark and somewhat agitated contrast to the tranquil opening theme. The third movement is a beautifully structure Minuet, and the closing movement a strikingly refreshing Rondo Sonata. This music was composed relatively late in Mozart's life (K525). Only a mature Mozart could have rendered such elegance in such a seemingly simple syntax, and by looking at all four movements, we have virtually the major forms and stylistic practices distilled to their essence.        A Moment of Confluence: The Brevity of &quot;High Classicism&quot;   There were several factors at work that seemed coalesce in the years 1750-1800 that brought about the conditions under which the high classical style emerged:     Haydn's experience with St&uuml;rm und Drang, empfindsamkeit, obbligato accompaniment and other rhetorical practices common to the time gave him the opportunity to synthesize and refine these elements into his musical style.    In general, there was a deep awareness of compositional techniques and styles which were eclectic and comprehensive. These were a part of the rhetoric of expression which was a deep concern for composers, musicians, and the aristocracy.    Mozart's contact with the international music scene, including Italian and French styles as well as the music of the the Mannheimers, the Viennese School, and the Bach sons enabled him to fuse international, eclectic musical practices into a highly personal style which developed even deeper with his knowledge of Haydn's music, especially the string quartets.    Haydn's efficient classical style seemed to undergo further development as he knew of Mozart's work with the string quartets and the symphonies.    French empirical rationalism had spread throughout Europe, England, and the American colonies. This philosophical stance reinforced classical ideals of rational form, symmetrical structures, balance, restraint, and moderation.    There was a spirit of experimentation with the rise of instrumental technology which led to the development of idiosyncratic instrumental styles, especially in the context of orchestral music. New approaches to the orchestra as a fixed performance ensemble influenced consolidation of form, textural development and contrast, and a strong sense of structural functions (including the use of dynamics and texture) within form. These factors eventually became evident in the emergence of the symphony, the classical concerto, and chamber music, most notably, the string quartet.    The patronage of the arts by the Church yielded to the dominance of patronage by the aristocracy (which was on a equal footing with the Church in the Baroque Era) in the latter half of the 18th Century. The social culture of the aristocracy was reflected in the classical musical style. However, the aristocracy itself began to decline in power throughout the 18th Century. More and more, the musical performers and musicians had to become entrepreneural, seeking to sell their services and their music through public concerts and through publication.    The industrial revolution was contributing to the idea of mass production and the replaceable part. Even Napoleon's modern army reflected this new social value. Previous armies had waged war in which the skills of individual warriors were emphasized. Napoleon turned the army into battalions with functions, so that if one battalion was wiped out, another could be put in its place. Human beings, as part of a complex war machine, became replaceable parts. Underlying the concept of mass production is basic structure stripped to its essence, along with the concept of functional parts. Structure and function become a point of emphasis in classical style.   The orchestra began to emerge as a reflection of this mechanical model. Many \"machines\" for making music were improved and developed (such as the piano with its hammer and levers). The orchestra developed into sections with functions. Because the orchestra demanded greater attention to creating a mixture of sections and control over dynamics and articulations, it needed the shaping and control of a director. The conductor (as foreman of this large and complex musical machine) finally became indispensable. During Mid-Century musical practice the Baroque approach of conducting from the keyboard alternated with the use of the conductor in front of the orchestra.    The Freemasons had come into existence in England and the society spread to Europe and to the American Colonies, often making claims to antiquity. The Freemasons were secret societies fostering the ideal of freedom. Freedom in the days of the monarchies and ruling families was looked on as subversive to the ruling classes. But it is clear that the Freemasons played major roles in the American and French Revolution. Mozart, a Freemason, introduced Haydn to Freemasonry and Haydn was inducted into a sister lodge to Mozart's lodge. Their first associations appear to have come from the meetings and musical performance as part of the masonry activities. Beethoven was also inducted into the Freemasons as was Schubert later on. The impact of Freemasonry on the music and social activities of the times has largely been ignored or underestimated. These secret societies were necessary since open advocacy for the freedom of the individual was regarded as treason by the royal ruling class. The rise of the Freemason movement coincides with the decline of power of the wealthy families and the ruling courts of the royal descendents.      Whereas the Baroque Period was a period of some 150 years, the classical period appears almost as a brief \"hiatus\" which dominates musical practice for about 30 years before yielding to the forces of romanticism which had been held in check by aristocracy which embraced the rationalist philosophy.   This remarkable confluence of forces set the conditions which produced a tremendous amount of music in such a brief time. Major forms which persist through this century were established and solidified. Developmental techniques for transforming musical material were extended and refined. The genre and musical compositions created by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven have become a body of works which may be one of the greatest legacies of the 18th Century.   The romantic elements were more a part of the \"common culture,\" and the collapse of the hold of aristocracy over the individuals in society, which began with the American Revolution and spread to Europe with the French Revolution, helped to support the surge of Romanticism that permeated the arts of the 19th Century. Beethoven, whose heritage was that of Haydn and Mozart was already a part of the new Zeitgeist, the new spirit which was capturing the imagination of artists and philosophers of the 19th Century. His first symphony serves both as homage to classical style and the signaling of a new energy and spirit that would find full fruition by the time of his Symphony No. 3."}]},

Gilbert All Rights Reserved           Baroque Style    The classical style would reflect a much simpler approach to sound in time than had been the Baroque style which was a highly complex polyphonic musical texture, whose energy was derived from the rhythmic continuo, the unity of texture, and the continuous organic development of a motivic \"germ\" which was the essence of the musical substance of each specific form. The term \"baroque\" was originally a perjorative that was used to describe a style that was too ornamental, even too sentimental and bombastic for the tastes of the aristocracy in the late 18th Century. The picture above of a concert in a Baroque Concert Hall  reveals the highly ornamented archtectural style of the Baroque era which was reflected in the musical style as well. A detail of this Baroque orchestral concert reveals the setup of the orchestra with some audience on the stage as well as dignitaries seating in the middle of the orchestra perhaps the 17th version of \"surround sound.\"    In general, architecture, furniture, and sculpture reflected the ornate tastes of people in the Baroque era. Underlying the basic structure was the substance which gave expression to the structure. The organ in the Baroque church as pictured here shows the ornate treatment of the pipes and superstucture of the organ. Such ornamentation reflects two important points: ornamentation can be a way of individualizing and personalizing the general, and ornamentation also lends itself to a great deal of attention paid to detail. In musical practice the musician had to be highly accomplished in the art of ornamentation in order to improvise over a basic structure. In Da Capo settings the return to the A section always was invested with the improvisation of the performer which provided a deepening of the expressive range of the materials. Baroque ornamentation produces a rich and complex effect which the 18th Century interpreted as too bombastic and confusing. The 18th Century was more concerned with the universality of expression.   In Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major (1st movement), we have an excellent example of the concerto grosso style. The work itself is in concerto grosso form with three movements (fast-slow-fast), with the middle movement using only the solo instruments plus continuo (continuo consisted of a keyboard instrument, usually harpsichord, plus a bass instrument, such as cello).  You can select the music at the right to follow an excerpt of the score with the music. Concerto grosso style refers to the alternation of orchestra, ripieno (the ripieno consisting of the solo instruments with continuo), and tutti (orchestra + ripieno). The continuo is always present. The harpsichordist read from the bass line and improvised the upper voices according to a figured bass which described the arrangement of the intervals above the bass.   The Baroque style was strongly influenced by the Doctrine of Affections and the values emphasized the unity of affect (i.e., unity of mood) within the same movement. If there was a \"contrasting section,\" it was consider a shading of the original affect. This was reflected in the music as a unity of texture. The main shift in texture is simply the alternation of the performing groups which also controlled the dynamic levels. The musical material was derived from the opening motive was appeared in the first measure. This motive then underwent continuous development and modulated to the diatonically related keys. The larger the form, the more keys that are included. The use of tonality and modulation was a major factor in sustaining larger forms. This first movement is in three sections. The continuous steady rhythm and overlapping of the orchestra and ripieno often disguises the \"seams\" that denote sections, although in this movement Bach helps us by bringing the instruments to a brief halt for half a beat before resuming with a unison orchestral passage that signals the third section and the return to the key, much the way a recapitulation works in sonata form."}, {"content": "NYU Course: Music Literature--The Classical Period: Prelude to Classicism                                                                                     E85.2073: Music Literature: The Classical Period  Prelude to Classicism   Copyright 1997-98 John V. Gilbert All Rights Reserved          PRELUDE TO THE CLASSIC PERIOD IN MUSIC   The danger in any historical account of a period in examining what preceded the period lies in the tendency to relegate the \"preceding era\" as less important than the destination, and the composers and musicians as \"also-rans,\" who were ultimately \"losers\" to the true geniuses of the Classical Period. Thus I wish to point out that I am using the idea of \"Prelude\" to Classical Music not in any sense of suggesting that the music and composers are less important than the Baroque period that came before or the Classical Period that came after. It is important to discard any biases in order to understand the richness of Mid-Century music in the 18th Century. It is a rich period of musical creativity and experimentation. One will find delightful and challenging syntheses of stylistic practices, a mixture of Baroque, romantic, and Classical features. There are many fine composers and performers during this era.    Diversity of Practices   It was the richness of experimentation and a shift in cultural values that lead to the dissolution of Baroque artistic values. The shift from a unity of mood and texture within a movement and a work to a deliberate inclusion of contrasting moods and textures is one of the strongest underlying musical practices that accounts for radical departures from the Baroque ideal. This one conceptual approach to content affects structure and form as well as the syntactical articulations. Whereas a shift in texture would denote a major demarcation structurally in the Baroque era, a shift in texture in Classical practice is a building block of a section. Up until this period in musical practice, composers had been concerned with the manipulation of pitch melodically and harmonically over time, and the alternation of timbre over time. How the creation of musical textures and the changing and alternation of textures over time became just as important as pitch considerations in establishing form.   Moreover, the concerto grosso of the Baroque addressed the presence of the emerging virtuoso performer. In fact a major feature of the concerto grosso as a form is that the composer would utilize whatever virtuoso performers might be available for a particular performance. Therefore, the only set groups for the Baroque orchestra are the continuo and strings. The \"concertino\" (small group of soloists) changed from work to work. But there was growing emphasis on the virtuosity of performance. This virtuosity had been linked also to the improvisational powers of soloists in the Baroque where the performers could really showcase their performance prowess. This virtuosity began to demand greater skills in the orchestra, and greater uniformity in orchestral articulation. The conductor emerges during this time as an important interpreter and dictator over the technical performance of the orchestra.      Models and Styles  Leonard Ratner points out the importance of understanding what he describes as \"topics\" (models) and \"styles\" which were familiar to composers and musicians of the 18th Century. He derives these ideas from the practice of rhetoric of this age, a discipline which helped articulate the idea of musical expression, and the devices available to the composer and musician to express specific musical ideas and feelings. Ratner describes the musical practice of the 18th Century being guided by the rhetoric of the period as follows:       From its contacts with worship, poetry, drama, entertainment, dance,   ceremony, the military, the hunt, and the life of the lower classes,   music in the early 18th century developed a thesaurus of   characteristic figures, which formed rich legacy for classic   composers. Some of these figures were associated with various   feelings and affections; others had a picturesque flavor. They are   designated here as topics ---subjects for musical discourse. Topics   appear as fully worked-out pieces, i.e., types, or as figures and   progressions within a piece, i.e., styles. The distinction between types   and styles is flexible; minuets and marches represent complete types   of composition, but they also furnish styles for other pieces. (Ratner,   p. 9)   Ratner's \"topics\" (i.e. themes, models, or techniques) are organized into \"Types\" and \"Styles\" with some additional comments on pictorialism, word painting, and use of topics.   For \"Types\", Ratner describes dances as an important source for Types. The dance forms all share a similar superficial structure, but the dances of the 18th Century embody feeling. There is no question that the dances of the 18th Century are derived from the popular culture and developed more elaborately in the Baroque dance suites. Composers chose dances to include in the suites in relationship to the occasion. Unity of affect was an important factor in the Baroque dance suites. By the middle of the 18th Century, unity of mood or affect was replaced by contrast, and dance forms and the spirit of their content were used in instrumental settings such as sinfonia. The relationship of the dance form to the sonata form is certainly apparent and Beethoven later achieves this fusion of forms in his scherzo-trio third movement form of the symphony.   Because the dances were compact, they were perfect as models of composition. Mozart is known to have used dance models to teach composition, and often dance forms are present in classical works, even though the name of the movement or composition may not be identified as a dance.  Under \"Dances\", Ratner lists Minuet and Related Types. The minuet is by far the most common dance which attracted composers of the 18th Century. This is largely because of its presence in the Symphony, but also because of its valued status among the aristocracy. Ratner includes other triple meter dances such as \"Waltzes, L&auml;ndler, allemandes, Schleifer (sliding dances), and Swabian allemandes...\" These were livelier and simpler than the more courtly minuet.   Also under dances was the Polonaise, another triple meter dance which was somewhat serious and deliberate in style. The dance features a pause on a syncopation or the last beat of the measure. According to Ratner's sources the polonaise fell out of favor in mid-century but returns in the classical period as a quick dance. Dances included under types in the duple meter are the Bour&eacute;e, a lively dance, the Countredanse, a standard in the ballet of classical times brilliant and simple (not ornate), and the Gavotte with a cesura appearing on the second quarter note of the measure with this rhythmic pattern retain throughout. The Gavotte is used both as a lively tempo form and a slow form. The compound meter included dances such as the Gigue, a lively dance in 6/8 meter and the Siciliano which was performed in a slow, languishing tempo. The Gigue itself disappeared during the classical era, but its style was retained in the finales of classical compositions.   According to Ratner, the March was used both ceremonially and as a dance in the 18th Century. The March used the duple meter, dotted rhythms, and a sense of bravado which developed the association with parades, the battlefield and authority in general. It was to this world of authority what the minuet was to royalty, nobility, and court life in general.   Dances and dance styles find their way into classical practice through social dances, theatrical dances, and what Ratner describes as \"...speculative treatment of dance material.\" Composers appropriate these styles into their concert music in sonatas, symphonies, concertos and music for the church and theatre.   For \"Styles, Ratner makes a convincing case for the formal acquisition of various styles as a part of the composer's training in the 18th Century. Included in these styles are the following:    Military and Hunt Music using fanfares and hunting signals which had emerged as part of the ceremony of the hunt and the military occasions, including parades played by the town bands.  Singing Style  a lyrical, melodic style in a moderate tempo with generally slow rhythmic durations and a narrow range, often associated with the Italian bel canto.   The Brilliant Style which featured rapid passages to display virtuoso skills or powerful feeling.  The French Overture with its \"slow-fast-slow\" arrangement of sections and typical dotted rhythms in the slow tempo.  Musette and Pastorale  with a sustained base drone and pastoral-like tune above the drone.  Turkish Music  which brings the colorful use of triangles, drums, cymbals, and wind instruments to the classical texture.  St&uuml;rm und Drang (Storm and Stress)  a term borrowed from the play St&uuml;rm und Drang is used to refer to music expressing intense, subjective feelings.  Empfindsamkeit  a personal, intimate and often sentimental style.  The Strict Style/The Learned Style  all of the above styles became known as free or \"galant\" style associated with theatre and chamber music as opposed to the strict or bound style which was fugal in character and was associated with the church.  Fantasia characterized by sudden contrasts, chromaticism, elaborate figures, shifting tonalities, all conveying a somewhat improvisational style.       An Emerging Synthesis of Diverse Practices  We can see that these emerging styles and models gave concrete identity to materials which could be contrasted. The principle of unity at this time becomes linked to the concept of control through contrast. This will cause composers to develop rather profound approaches to the musical content to establish unity within contrast.   It is also important to note the characteristics of national stylistic practices and their roles in the synthesis of a new style. The Rococo and style galant provided an emphasis on articulation and ornamentation which lent itself especially well to French keyboard music providing a spontaneous, improvisational quality. It was almost as though the French predilection had removed the highly polyphonic ornamentation of the Baroque for a simpler, more melodic manifestation of ornamentation. The Italian bel canto style of the opera with an emphasis on lyrical melody supported by simple accompaniment brought a fresh contrast to the highly polyphonic style of northern Europe. Northern Europe with its strict or bound style was given to fugal and imitative writing producing complex interaction of musical materials. It is the fusion and even the relegation of function of these practices to musical forms that contributes heavily to the development of classical style.     In addition, the styles and divergent practices provide a certain architectural approach to musical texture. Indeed, musical texture becomes a musical factor to be controlled over time as important to musical structure as the control of pitch over time (through melody and harmony) has played in establishing musical form. Musical texture might be described as a structuring of figuration to establish structural areas within a composition as well as providing a need for transitions and overlapping of textures which must be regarded as coupled to the \"process of tonality\" as established by sonata \"form.\" Sonata as form is quite misleading. The sonata is a process much more than it is a form. As classical style takes on definite characteristics, the shaping of music texture as a structural element is evident. Alternation of textures and repetition of textures becomes an additional unifying feature.   A sense of proportion to musical sections is an important underlying consideration for the overall form.

Gilbert All Rights Reserved           Ideals of Western Art as Manifest in the &quot;New&quot; Classicism of the 18th Century   The \"high classic style\" is beautifully epitomized in Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik .  The opening measures reval the clarity of the structure, the theme being stated as an arpeggiation of the tonic G Major triad in second inversions, being answered by the argpeggiation of the dominant sevent in root position. The theme itself is a co,plex structure made up of simple structures. Measures 1-10 are a contrasting period form with a two measure extension coupled to a parallel period form (mm. 11-18). The cadence at measure 18 serves as the end of the second period form and the beginning of the transition (mm. 18-27) to the dominant to prepare for the second theme. Notice how the textures provide contrast within this highly unified statement of the theme: the first four measures are unison with rests creating an openness to the texture, the next four plus extension use a contrasting interation of a g-pedal tone and steady, connected and rhythmically vital eighth-note activity. The second half of the theme begins with a legao duo in the upper strings with imitation in the lower voices, and the transition to the dominant is based on the texture and material presented in measures 5-10.   In this opening passage (the first half of the Exposition) the classical ideals of balance, symmetry, clarity, contrast, restraint, moderation, proportion, and form are revealed. Notice how the contrasting sections of texture tend to balance each other. The symmetry of period form is the basic organizing force, the two period forms are joined to form a double period form for the structure of the first theme. Mozart avoids the predictability of this symmetry through the use of the extension and using an elision (the end of a section serving as the beginning of the next). Even at its most robust statement (the opening measures and the transition), the energy is restrained, contained within the limits of moderation. There is nothing to excess here.     By clicking on the first page, you can listen to the first movement of this very popular classical work. It is a testament to the work that with all of its performances and recordings, the music remains refresh and vital, a true test of a \"classic\" in the more popular use of the term.   Each movement of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik provides a microcosm of style and form of the late 18th Century musical style. The first movement is exemplary of sonata allegro form, with themes that are extraordinary in their structure, each serving to balance the contrasting thematic material. The development is concise, but highly concentrated, and the recapitulation with the codetta closes the movement. The second movement combines theme and variations with elements of Rondo ultimately encased in a large ABA song form with the B section providing a dark and somewhat agitated contrast to the tranquil opening theme. The third movement is a beautifully structure Minuet, and the closing movement a strikingly refreshing Rondo Sonata. This music was composed relatively late in Mozart's life (K525). Only a mature Mozart could have rendered such elegance in such a seemingly simple syntax, and by looking at all four movements, we have virtually the major forms and stylistic practices distilled to their essence.        A Moment of Confluence: The Brevity of &quot;High Classicism&quot;   There were several factors at work that seemed coalesce in the years 1750-1800 that brought about the conditions under which the high classical style emerged:     Haydn's experience with St&uuml;rm und Drang, empfindsamkeit, obbligato accompaniment and other rhetorical practices common to the time gave him the opportunity to synthesize and refine these elements into his musical style.    In general, there was a deep awareness of compositional techniques and styles which were eclectic and comprehensive. These were a part of the rhetoric of expression which was a deep concern for composers, musicians, and the aristocracy.    Mozart's contact with the international music scene, including Italian and French styles as well as the music of the the Mannheimers, the Viennese School, and the Bach sons enabled him to fuse international, eclectic musical practices into a highly personal style which developed even deeper with his knowledge of Haydn's music, especially the string quartets.    Haydn's efficient classical style seemed to undergo further development as he knew of Mozart's work with the string quartets and the symphonies.    French empirical rationalism had spread throughout Europe, England, and the American colonies. This philosophical stance reinforced classical ideals of rational form, symmetrical structures, balance, restraint, and moderation.    There was a spirit of experimentation with the rise of instrumental technology which led to the development of idiosyncratic instrumental styles, especially in the context of orchestral music. New approaches to the orchestra as a fixed performance ensemble influenced consolidation of form, textural development and contrast, and a strong sense of structural functions (including the use of dynamics and texture) within form. These factors eventually became evident in the emergence of the symphony, the classical concerto, and chamber music, most notably, the string quartet.    The patronage of the arts by the Church yielded to the dominance of patronage by the aristocracy (which was on a equal footing with the Church in the Baroque Era) in the latter half of the 18th Century. The social culture of the aristocracy was reflected in the classical musical style. However, the aristocracy itself began to decline in power throughout the 18th Century. More and more, the musical performers and musicians had to become entrepreneural, seeking to sell their services and their music through public concerts and through publication.    The industrial revolution was contributing to the idea of mass production and the replaceable part. Even Napoleon's modern army reflected this new social value. Previous armies had waged war in which the skills of individual warriors were emphasized. Napoleon turned the army into battalions with functions, so that if one battalion was wiped out, another could be put in its place. Human beings, as part of a complex war machine, became replaceable parts. Underlying the concept of mass production is basic structure stripped to its essence, along with the concept of functional parts. Structure and function become a point of emphasis in classical style.   The orchestra began to emerge as a reflection of this mechanical model. Many \"machines\" for making music were improved and developed (such as the piano with its hammer and levers). The orchestra developed into sections with functions. Because the orchestra demanded greater attention to creating a mixture of sections and control over dynamics and articulations, it needed the shaping and control of a director. The conductor (as foreman of this large and complex musical machine) finally became indispensable. During Mid-Century musical practice the Baroque approach of conducting from the keyboard alternated with the use of the conductor in front of the orchestra.    The Freemasons had come into existence in England and the society spread to Europe and to the American Colonies, often making claims to antiquity. The Freemasons were secret societies fostering the ideal of freedom. Freedom in the days of the monarchies and ruling families was looked on as subversive to the ruling classes. But it is clear that the Freemasons played major roles in the American and French Revolution. Mozart, a Freemason, introduced Haydn to Freemasonry and Haydn was inducted into a sister lodge to Mozart's lodge. Their first associations appear to have come from the meetings and musical performance as part of the masonry activities. Beethoven was also inducted into the Freemasons as was Schubert later on. The impact of Freemasonry on the music and social activities of the times has largely been ignored or underestimated. These secret societies were necessary since open advocacy for the freedom of the individual was regarded as treason by the royal ruling class. The rise of the Freemason movement coincides with the decline of power of the wealthy families and the ruling courts of the royal descendents.      Whereas the Baroque Period was a period of some 150 years, the classical period appears almost as a brief \"hiatus\" which dominates musical practice for about 30 years before yielding to the forces of romanticism which had been held in check by aristocracy which embraced the rationalist philosophy.   This remarkable confluence of forces set the conditions which produced a tremendous amount of music in such a brief time. Major forms which persist through this century were established and solidified. Developmental techniques for transforming musical material were extended and refined. The genre and musical compositions created by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven have become a body of works which may be one of the greatest legacies of the 18th Century.   The romantic elements were more a part of the \"common culture,\" and the collapse of the hold of aristocracy over the individuals in society, which began with the American Revolution and spread to Europe with the French Revolution, helped to support the surge of Romanticism that permeated the arts of the 19th Century. Beethoven, whose heritage was that of Haydn and Mozart was already a part of the new Zeitgeist, the new spirit which was capturing the imagination of artists and philosophers of the 19th Century. His first symphony serves both as homage to classical style and the signaling of a new energy and spirit that would find full fruition by the time of his Symphony No. 3."}, {"content": "NYU Course: Music Literature--The Classical Period: Baroque Style                                                                                     E85.2073: Music Literature: The Classical Period  Baroque Style   Copyright 1997-98 John V. Gilbert All Rights Reserved           Baroque Style    The classical style would reflect a much simpler approach to sound in time than had been the Baroque style which was a highly complex polyphonic musical texture, whose energy was derived from the rhythmic continuo, the unity of texture, and the continuous organic development of a motivic \"germ\" which was the essence of the musical substance of each specific form. The term \"baroque\" was originally a perjorative that was used to describe a style that was too ornamental, even too sentimental and bombastic for the tastes of the aristocracy in the late 18th Century. The picture above of a concert in a Baroque Concert Hall  reveals the highly ornamented archtectural style of the Baroque era which was reflected in the musical style as well. A detail of this Baroque orchestral concert reveals the setup of the orchestra with some audience on the stage as well as dignitaries seating in the middle of the orchestra perhaps the 17th version of \"surround sound.\"    In general, architecture, furniture, and sculpture reflected the ornate tastes of people in the Baroque era. Underlying the basic structure was the substance which gave expression to the structure. The organ in the Baroque church as pictured here shows the ornate treatment of the pipes and superstucture of the organ. Such ornamentation reflects two important points: ornamentation can be a way of individualizing and personalizing the general, and ornamentation also lends itself to a great deal of attention paid to detail. In musical practice the musician had to be highly accomplished in the art of ornamentation in order to improvise over a basic structure. In Da Capo settings the return to the A section always was invested with the improvisation of the performer which provided a deepening of the expressive range of the materials. Baroque ornamentation produces a rich and complex effect which the 18th Century interpreted as too bombastic and confusing. The 18th Century was more concerned with the universality of expression.   In Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major (1st movement), we have an excellent example of the concerto grosso style. The work itself is in concerto grosso form with three movements (fast-slow-fast), with the middle movement using only the solo instruments plus continuo (continuo consisted of a keyboard instrument, usually harpsichord, plus a bass instrument, such as cello).  You can select the music at the right to follow an excerpt of the score with the music. Concerto grosso style refers to the alternation of orchestra, ripieno (the ripieno consisting of the solo instruments with continuo), and tutti (orchestra + ripieno). The continuo is always present. The harpsichordist read from the bass line and improvised the upper voices according to a figured bass which described the arrangement of the intervals above the bass.   The Baroque style was strongly influenced by the Doctrine of Affections and the values emphasized the unity of affect (i.e., unity of mood) within the same movement. If there was a \"contrasting section,\" it was consider a shading of the original affect. This was reflected in the music as a unity of texture. The main shift in texture is simply the alternation of the performing groups which also controlled the dynamic levels. The musical material was derived from the opening motive was appeared in the first measure. This motive then underwent continuous development and modulated to the diatonically related keys. The larger the form, the more keys that are included. The use of tonality and modulation was a major factor in sustaining larger forms. This first movement is in three sections. The continuous steady rhythm and overlapping of the orchestra and ripieno often disguises the \"seams\" that denote sections, although in this movement Bach helps us by bringing the instruments to a brief halt for half a beat before resuming with a unison orchestral passage that signals the third section and the return to the key, much the way a recapitulation works in sonata form."}, {"content": "NYU Course: Music Literature--The Classical Period: Prelude to Classicism                                                                                     E85.2073: Music Literature: The Classical Period  Prelude to Classicism   Copyright 1997-98 John V. Gilbert All Rights Reserved          PRELUDE TO THE CLASSIC PERIOD IN MUSIC   The danger in any historical account of a period in examining what preceded the period lies in the tendency to relegate the \"preceding era\" as less important than the destination, and the composers and musicians as \"also-rans,\" who were ultimately \"losers\" to the true geniuses of the Classical Period. Thus I wish to point out that I am using the idea of \"Prelude\" to Classical Music not in any sense of suggesting that the music and composers are less important than the Baroque period that came before or the Classical Period that came after. It is important to discard any biases in order to understand the richness of Mid-Century music in the 18th Century. It is a rich period of musical creativity and experimentation. One will find delightful and challenging syntheses of stylistic practices, a mixture of Baroque, romantic, and Classical features. There are many fine composers and performers during this era.    Diversity of Practices   It was the richness of experimentation and a shift in cultural values that lead to the dissolution of Baroque artistic values. The shift from a unity of mood and texture within a movement and a work to a deliberate inclusion of contrasting moods and textures is one of the strongest underlying musical practices that accounts for radical departures from the Baroque ideal. This one conceptual approach to content affects structure and form as well as the syntactical articulations. Whereas a shift in texture would denote a major demarcation structurally in the Baroque era, a shift in texture in Classical practice is a building block of a section. Up until this period in musical practice, composers had been concerned with the manipulation of pitch melodically and harmonically over time, and the alternation of timbre over time. How the creation of musical textures and the changing and alternation of textures over time became just as important as pitch considerations in establishing form.   Moreover, the concerto grosso of the Baroque addressed the presence of the emerging virtuoso performer. In fact a major feature of the concerto grosso as a form is that the composer would utilize whatever virtuoso performers might be available for a particular performance. Therefore, the only set groups for the Baroque orchestra are the continuo and strings. The \"concertino\" (small group of soloists) changed from work to work. But there was growing emphasis on the virtuosity of performance. This virtuosity had been linked also to the improvisational powers of soloists in the Baroque where the performers could really showcase their performance prowess. This virtuosity began to demand greater skills in the orchestra, and greater uniformity in orchestral articulation. The conductor emerges during this time as an important interpreter and dictator over the technical performance of the orchestra.      Models and Styles  Leonard Ratner points out the importance of understanding what he describes as \"topics\" (models) and \"styles\" which were familiar to composers and musicians of the 18th Century. He derives these ideas from the practice of rhetoric of this age, a discipline which helped articulate the idea of musical expression, and the devices available to the composer and musician to express specific musical ideas and feelings. Ratner describes the musical practice of the 18th Century being guided by the rhetoric of the period as follows:       From its contacts with worship, poetry, drama, entertainment, dance,   ceremony, the military, the hunt, and the life of the lower classes,   music in the early 18th century developed a thesaurus of   characteristic figures, which formed rich legacy for classic   composers. Some of these figures were associated with various   feelings and affections; others had a picturesque flavor. They are   designated here as topics ---subjects for musical discourse. Topics   appear as fully worked-out pieces, i.e., types, or as figures and   progressions within a piece, i.e., styles. The distinction between types   and styles is flexible; minuets and marches represent complete types   of composition, but they also furnish styles for other pieces. (Ratner,   p. 9)   Ratner's \"topics\" (i.e. themes, models, or techniques) are organized into \"Types\" and \"Styles\" with some additional comments on pictorialism, word painting, and use of topics.   For \"Types\", Ratner describes dances as an important source for Types. The dance forms all share a similar superficial structure, but the dances of the 18th Century embody feeling. There is no question that the dances of the 18th Century are derived from the popular culture and developed more elaborately in the Baroque dance suites. Composers chose dances to include in the suites in relationship to the occasion. Unity of affect was an important factor in the Baroque dance suites. By the middle of the 18th Century, unity of mood or affect was replaced by contrast, and dance forms and the spirit of their content were used in instrumental settings such as sinfonia. The relationship of the dance form to the sonata form is certainly apparent and Beethoven later achieves this fusion of forms in his scherzo-trio third movement form of the symphony.   Because the dances were compact, they were perfect as models of composition. Mozart is known to have used dance models to teach composition, and often dance forms are present in classical works, even though the name of the movement or composition may not be identified as a dance.  Under \"Dances\", Ratner lists Minuet and Related Types. The minuet is by far the most common dance which attracted composers of the 18th Century. This is largely because of its presence in the Symphony, but also because of its valued status among the aristocracy. Ratner includes other triple meter dances such as \"Waltzes, L&auml;ndler, allemandes, Schleifer (sliding dances), and Swabian allemandes...\" These were livelier and simpler than the more courtly minuet.   Also under dances was the Polonaise, another triple meter dance which was somewhat serious and deliberate in style. The dance features a pause on a syncopation or the last beat of the measure. According to Ratner's sources the polonaise fell out of favor in mid-century but returns in the classical period as a quick dance. Dances included under types in the duple meter are the Bour&eacute;e, a lively dance, the Countredanse, a standard in the ballet of classical times brilliant and simple (not ornate), and the Gavotte with a cesura appearing on the second quarter note of the measure with this rhythmic pattern retain throughout. The Gavotte is used both as a lively tempo form and a slow form. The compound meter included dances such as the Gigue, a lively dance in 6/8 meter and the Siciliano which was performed in a slow, languishing tempo. The Gigue itself disappeared during the classical era, but its style was retained in the finales of classical compositions.   According to Ratner, the March was used both ceremonially and as a dance in the 18th Century. The March used the duple meter, dotted rhythms, and a sense of bravado which developed the association with parades, the battlefield and authority in general. It was to this world of authority what the minuet was to royalty, nobility, and court life in general.   Dances and dance styles find their way into classical practice through social dances, theatrical dances, and what Ratner describes as \"...speculative treatment of dance material.\" Composers appropriate these styles into their concert music in sonatas, symphonies, concertos and music for the church and theatre.   For \"Styles, Ratner makes a convincing case for the formal acquisition of various styles as a part of the composer's training in the 18th Century. Included in these styles are the following:    Military and Hunt Music using fanfares and hunting signals which had emerged as part of the ceremony of the hunt and the military occasions, including parades played by the town bands.  Singing Style  a lyrical, melodic style in a moderate tempo with generally slow rhythmic durations and a narrow range, often associated with the Italian bel canto.   The Brilliant Style which featured rapid passages to display virtuoso skills or powerful feeling.  The French Overture with its \"slow-fast-slow\" arrangement of sections and typical dotted rhythms in the slow tempo.  Musette and Pastorale  with a sustained base drone and pastoral-like tune above the drone.  Turkish Music  which brings the colorful use of triangles, drums, cymbals, and wind instruments to the classical texture.  St&uuml;rm und Drang (Storm and Stress)  a term borrowed from the play St&uuml;rm und Drang is used to refer to music expressing intense, subjective feelings.  Empfindsamkeit  a personal, intimate and often sentimental style.  The Strict Style/The Learned Style  all of the above styles became known as free or \"galant\" style associated with theatre and chamber music as opposed to the strict or bound style which was fugal in character and was associated with the church.  Fantasia characterized by sudden contrasts, chromaticism, elaborate figures, shifting tonalities, all conveying a somewhat improvisational style.       An Emerging Synthesis of Diverse Practices  We can see that these emerging styles and models gave concrete identity to materials which could be contrasted. The principle of unity at this time becomes linked to the concept of control through contrast. This will cause composers to develop rather profound approaches to the musical content to establish unity within contrast.   It is also important to note the characteristics of national stylistic practices and their roles in the synthesis of a new style. The Rococo and style galant provided an emphasis on articulation and ornamentation which lent itself especially well to French keyboard music providing a spontaneous, improvisational quality. It was almost as though the French predilection had removed the highly polyphonic ornamentation of the Baroque for a simpler, more melodic manifestation of ornamentation. The Italian bel canto style of the opera with an emphasis on lyrical melody supported by simple accompaniment brought a fresh contrast to the highly polyphonic style of northern Europe. Northern Europe with its strict or bound style was given to fugal and imitative writing producing complex interaction of musical materials. It is the fusion and even the relegation of function of these practices to musical forms that contributes heavily to the development of classical style.     In addition, the styles and divergent practices provide a certain architectural approach to musical texture. Indeed, musical texture becomes a musical factor to be controlled over time as important to musical structure as the control of pitch over time (through melody and harmony) has played in establishing musical form. Musical texture might be described as a structuring of figuration to establish structural areas within a composition as well as providing a need for transitions and overlapping of textures which must be regarded as coupled to the \"process of tonality\" as established by sonata \"form.\" Sonata as form is quite misleading. The sonata is a process much more than it is a form. As classical style takes on definite characteristics, the shaping of music texture as a structural element is evident. Alternation of textures and repetition of textures becomes an additional unifying feature.   A sense of proportion to musical sections is an important underlying consideration for the overall form. Contrast must be achieved within the context of clarity, restraint, and balance. Musical content is developed through figuration which is often symmetrical. The classical melody is stripped of the ornamentation of the Baroque melody except occasionally at cadence points. Melodies are often triadic, adding to the clarity and simplicity of expression."}]}]
