Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.

As a student at NYU London, you will be residing in the Bloomsbury area. Bloomsbury is primarily known as the literary capital and walking around you will be overwhelmed by the number of book shops.

What would you do with 30 days in London?   \"See a football game, sit in a park on any sunny day, go to a different room of the British Museum each day, visit the latest art installation in the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, go on day trips outside of Central London to Primrose Hill, or walk along the River Thames.   - Nigel Freeman, Assistant Director Student Life         Learn     Courses   Special Programs   Freshman Program   Facilities   Faculty   Community Service   English for Academic Purposes                 Live     Housing     Culture &amp; Customs   Safety   Health &amp; Wellness     Cost &amp; Budgeting   Staff                 Explore      Restaurants    Things to do    Local Travel    Regional Travel                                                                                         NYU Centers Abroad...

The two main recommendations Londoners will offer are: (1) always carry a waterproof jacket or an umbrella (or \"brolly,\" as the English call it) and, (2) dress in layers so you can be comfortable if the weather changes.   London experiences a relatively moderate change in temperature throughout the seasons. Winter lows rarely drop below freezing and tend to hover around the mid to low 40s. The warmer months, are not particularly warm either, with the average summer temperature being around 70, though temperatures do rise into the 90s on occasion.            Getting Around   London has an extensive public transportation system with the Tube and the bus. When you arrive in London you will receive an Oyster Card, the use of which makes fares cheaper and journeys easier. Tube rides vary depending on which \u201czone\u201d you travel to and when you travel; however, most journeys will be within Central London, or \u201cZone 1,\u201d and that costs \u00a32.00 with an Oyster Card (as opposed to \u00a34.30 without one). Bus rides will cost you \u00a31.35 with any Oyster Card (and \u00a32.30 without).                                                  Questions?

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.

Getting Around   London has an extensive public transportation system with the Tube and the bus. When you arrive in London you will receive an Oyster Card, the use of which makes fares cheaper and journeys easier. Tube rides vary depending on which \u201czone\u201d you travel to and when you travel; however, most journeys will be within Central London, or \u201cZone 1,\u201d and that costs \u00a32.00 with an Oyster Card (as opposed to \u00a34.30 without one). Bus rides will cost you \u00a31.35 with any Oyster Card (and \u00a32.30 without).                                                  Questions?
