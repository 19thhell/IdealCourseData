We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English) and Prof. Robles (Media, Culture &amp; Communication)   syllabus  Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)   syllabus According to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us, as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories), some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus  \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus  What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus Examines Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson, Goethe, and Nietzsche. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed.

Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French)   syllabus  The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality.

Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents.

Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and   overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction   between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing   nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian   scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's   Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson,   Goethe, and Nietzsche.  top of page           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English) and Prof. Robles (Media, Culture &amp; Communication)   syllabus  Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)   syllabus According to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us, as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories), some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus  \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus  What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past.

FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus Examines Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson, Goethe, and Nietzsche. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed.

SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French)   syllabus  The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus  Examines   Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural   world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and   overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction   between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing   nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian   scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's   Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson,   Goethe, and Nietzsche.  top of page           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Literature Faculty, Department of English | NYU                                      NEW YORK UNIVERSITY       ARTS AND SCIENCE       COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE       GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE                                                                                       Home     People     Undergraduate Program       Graduate Programs       Leaves and Committees       Events       Newsletter       Employment       Donate to the English Department       Faculty Only               Home &gt; People       Literature Faculty         John M.
