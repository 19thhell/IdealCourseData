Learn more       In addition to our work on ATLAS, we are also key contributors to the   APEX experiment at Jefferson Lab,  active in the LHC upgrade, and contribute to various new ideas in particle physics experiments.   Prior to joining ATLAS, we were long term members of the MILAGRO  experiment until it came to an end and gave way to the next generation HAWC experiment, and  were involved in the MECO experiment before its termination.
