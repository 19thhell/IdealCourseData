This intensive two-week program is designed for poets, fiction writers, and nonfiction writers who wish to develop their process and to refine their craft in one of these areas.   During the two-week period, you will spend six mornings in improvisation workshops taught by the NYU School of Professional Studies Paul McGhee Division faculty members. These workshops will help you to find new ways of generating and revising text. You will participate in seven craft workshops in either poetry or prose that are taught by distinguished visiting writers. Valzhyna Mort is the invited poet; Etgar Keret , the invited fiction writer; and Sa\u00efd Sayrafiezadeh , the invited nonfiction writer. During two of the seven sessions, you will work with a writer in a genre other than your own. You also will have private conferences with the craft teacher in your area of concentration during the two-week workshop. In the evenings, you will attend readings, lectures, and social events.             Who Should Register?   Students must apply for admission to the program. A maximum of 12 poets, 12 fiction writers, and 12 nonfiction writers will be chosen to participate. Participants should have some prior coursework in poetry or prose. Students may apply on a credit or noncredit basis. Those taking the course for credit will be asked to submit additional written materials later in the summer.   Tuition   The total noncredit tuition is $2,860. The cost excludes transportation, housing, and meals. Students taking the course for credit pay the regular fee for a four-credit course in the NYU School of Professional Studies Paul McGhee Division .
