As the highest level of academic preparation for advanced clinical practice, the DNP prepares scholars for advanced clinical practice in a population focus area. In addition, DNP students learn to translate evidence-based knowledge into clinical practice and have a significant impact on health outcomes by strengthening system-level health care processes. NYU College of Nursing DNP graduates are prepared to:     Deliver direct patient care   Influence health policy   Promote patient safety   Resolve health care dilemmas   Lead interprofessional health care teams   Reduce disparities in health care     .   There are currently three entry points for the DNP Program:       Post-Baccalaureate (BS) to DNP option for those who are registered nurses with a baccalaureate degree in nursing;       Advanced Standing option for those who have earned a master\u2019s degree and are nurse practitioners (NPs) or certified nurse midwives (CNMs); and       Post-Master\u2019s option for those nurses who have a master\u2019s degree but are not NPs or CNMs. Advanced practice nurses with master\u2019s degrees who are not NPs or CNMs can apply for a post-master\u2019s advanced certificate program in order to become a NP or CNM.       Want to hear what makes the NYUCN Doctor of Nursing Practice program so special? Let our faculty, students, and DNP alumni tell you:           The Post BS to DNP option is designed for registered nurses (RNs) who seek to complete an advanced practice nursing program in one of three areas and advance seamlessly to a doctor of nursing practice degree. This DNP option saves time and credits. Post BS to DNP students can choose from the three of the six population foci listed below:     Advanced Practice Nursing: Adult Acute Care (Admitting as of fall 2015)   Advanced Practice Nursing: Mental Health Nursing (Admitting as of fall 2015)   Advanced Practice Nursing: Pediatrics (Admitting as of fall 2015)   Advanced Practice Nursing: Family Nurse Practitioner   Advanced Practice Nursing: Adult Primary Care   Nurse-Midwifery       In addition to advanced practice education and clinical preparation in nursing, students learn to evaluate and use research to improve patient care through the advanced leadership courses and their capstone projects. Students entering the advanced leadership component of the program are placed in teams to begin their work on a capstone project in a clinical agency. Each team is assigned their clinical placement as well as a faculty and clinical mentor to guide them through their project.   The Advanced Standing option is designed for nurse practitioners (NPs) or certified nurse midwives (CNMs) who are expert clinicians, leaders in their communities, caregivers, family members, partners and friends. The Advanced Standing DNP curriculum offers courses that aim to develop skill sets for clinical leaders. The NYU College of Nursing requires a minimum of 38 credits for completion of the advanced standing DNP degree. There are 10 different population foci for those accepted through the advanced standing option, please visit our website to learn more ( NYUCN DNP Advanced Standing ).   The Post-Master\u2019s option is for master\u2019s prepared nurses who are not NPs or CNMs, i.e., clinical nurse specialists, and nurse administrators, educators, or informatics specialists. Thus it requires that the student obtain a post master\u2019s certificate in one of the NP population foci or in nurse midwifery in addition to completing the Advanced Leadership Courses and a capstone project and practice improvement internship in a clinical agency. This option requires completion of 73 or more credits and 1000 clinical hours. Students\u2019 previous graduate coursework will be reviewed on an individual basis to determine the number of credits that would be transferrable into the DNP program.   Between NYUCN\u2019s world class faculty and its close proximity to esteemed medical centers, it is easy to see why our students are well positioned to become successful clinical leaders in the health care arena.

As the highest level of academic preparation for advanced clinical practice, the DNP prepares scholars for advanced clinical practice in a population focus area. In addition, DNP students learn to translate evidence-based knowledge into clinical practice and have a significant impact on health outcomes by strengthening system-level health care processes. NYU College of Nursing DNP graduates are prepared to:     Deliver direct patient care   Influence health policy   Promote patient safety   Resolve health care dilemmas   Lead interprofessional health care teams   Reduce disparities in health care     .   There are currently three entry points for the DNP Program:       Post-Baccalaureate (BS) to DNP option for those who are registered nurses with a baccalaureate degree in nursing;       Advanced Standing option for those who have earned a master\u2019s degree and are nurse practitioners (NPs) or certified nurse midwives (CNMs); and       Post-Master\u2019s option for those nurses who have a master\u2019s degree but are not NPs or CNMs. Advanced practice nurses with master\u2019s degrees who are not NPs or CNMs can apply for a post-master\u2019s advanced certificate program in order to become a NP or CNM.       Want to hear what makes the NYUCN Doctor of Nursing Practice program so special? Let our faculty, students, and DNP alumni tell you:           The Post BS to DNP option is designed for registered nurses (RNs) who seek to complete an advanced practice nursing program in one of three areas and advance seamlessly to a doctor of nursing practice degree. This DNP option saves time and credits. Post BS to DNP students can choose from the three of the six population foci listed below:     Advanced Practice Nursing: Adult Acute Care (Admitting as of fall 2015)   Advanced Practice Nursing: Mental Health Nursing (Admitting as of fall 2015)   Advanced Practice Nursing: Pediatrics (Admitting as of fall 2015)   Advanced Practice Nursing: Family Nurse Practitioner   Advanced Practice Nursing: Adult Primary Care   Nurse-Midwifery       In addition to advanced practice education and clinical preparation in nursing, students learn to evaluate and use research to improve patient care through the advanced leadership courses and their capstone projects. Students entering the advanced leadership component of the program are placed in teams to begin their work on a capstone project in a clinical agency. Each team is assigned their clinical placement as well as a faculty and clinical mentor to guide them through their project.   The Advanced Standing option is designed for nurse practitioners (NPs) or certified nurse midwives (CNMs) who are expert clinicians, leaders in their communities, caregivers, family members, partners and friends. The Advanced Standing DNP curriculum offers courses that aim to develop skill sets for clinical leaders. The NYU College of Nursing requires a minimum of 38 credits for completion of the advanced standing DNP degree. There are 10 different population foci for those accepted through the advanced standing option, please visit our website to learn more ( NYUCN DNP Advanced Standing ).   The Post-Master\u2019s option is for master\u2019s prepared nurses who are not NPs or CNMs, i.e., clinical nurse specialists, and nurse administrators, educators, or informatics specialists. Thus it requires that the student obtain a post master\u2019s certificate in one of the NP population foci or in nurse midwifery in addition to completing the Advanced Leadership Courses and a capstone project and practice improvement internship in a clinical agency. This option requires completion of 73 or more credits and 1000 clinical hours. Students\u2019 previous graduate coursework will be reviewed on an individual basis to determine the number of credits that would be transferrable into the DNP program.   Between NYUCN\u2019s world class faculty and its close proximity to esteemed medical centers, it is easy to see why our students are well positioned to become successful clinical leaders in the health care arena.

At the College of Nursing clinical experiences take place at both the Clinical Simulation Learning Center (CSLC), our \u201cvirtual hospital,\u201d the off-campus setting at acute care hospitals and community-based healthcare agencies. The CSLC is an innovative clinical learning environment for our undergraduate and graduate students to practice providing safe and competent nursing care. In today\u2019s complex healthcare system, it is important for students to have the opportunity to practice clinical skills using the most up to date technologies in an environment that imitates the real life patient care setting. In the BS in Nursing program about half of student clinical experiences take place at the CSLC. In the MS clinical programs and post-BS doctor of nursing practice programs students are also provided with clinical experiences at the CSLC, see On-Campus Clinical for more detailed information about the CSLC and on campus clinical simulation learning experiences.   The Office of Academic Clinical Affairs is responsible for ensuring that students meet the health care and clinical site requirements for their clinical experiences. This office is also responsible for securing the appropriate off-campus clinical learning sites and faculty who teach in both on and off-campus clinical. Meeting these health care requirements is critical to your progression through the nursing curriculum. See Requirements for details on clinical requirements.
