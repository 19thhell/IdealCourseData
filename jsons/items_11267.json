Other Resources    The library's monographic holdings are supplemented by the extensive    ERIC microfiche collection, which contains a substantial amount of fugitive    literature on areas of interest to students in Physical Education particularly.    The collection includes a solid core of the most frequently cited and    requested journals in both Physical Education and Leisure Studies.

Traditions: Chasing a cane; playing hide-and-seek with an old piece of    bread; dunking a classmate in a tub of water; tugging on a rope; eating    pancakes. None of these things affects a GPA. But almost since NYU's inception,    activities like these have added some spice to student life.    The earliest NYU students lived at home or boarded near campus. They    met for chapel, attended classes, and then their time was their own. Some    students formed literary societies, like the Philomathean Society, established    at NYU in 1832, and the Eucleian Society, in 1833. These groups offered    students a forum for formal debating, oratory, or presenting their own    poetry and prose.    Fraternities (like the Delta chapter of Phi Upsilon, founded at NYU    in 1837 and Delta Phi, in 1841) were also popular in the late nineteenth    century. The first fraternities at NYU were social ones, later groups    sought to attract students with their athletic, professional, intellectual,    and service activities. Fraternity membership has peaked and fallen from    decade to decade: according to the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life,    there are currently 25 fraternities and sororities at NYU.    Students also formed other groups. The Knights of the Lamp was a social    organization founded in 1914 at the School of Commerce. It allegedly met    every full moon and had the glowworm as its mascot. Clubs today fill interests    from cultural heritage to business to politics to Victorian studies.    Musical revues like the 1907 NYU Senior Show or performing groups like    the 1964 Glee Club gave students a chance to explore common interests    and share them with an audience. Music gave students another outlet as    well. Dances, from the formal 1911 Promenade to the 1960 prom to the informal    gatherings of the early 90s, offered social interaction and a chance to    shake the student body.    Community Service is a tradition at NYU: medical and dental students    provide care to the needy; law students contribute services to the disenfranchised;    business students work with settlement houses; social work students assist    community agencies. There are currently over one hundred service-oriented    clubs at NYU.                  A    Window Into the Past Home |  NYU    Archives Home"}]}]
