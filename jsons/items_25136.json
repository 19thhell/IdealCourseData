  Journalism is not just about reporting on individual \"news events.\" More and more, it's about getting a handle on the complicated reality that frames those events - the ever-shifting patterns of culture that determine how we live and what we make of our lives. As the mainstream media expand their cultural coverage and alternative publications and websites proliferate, there has never been more need for engaging, knowledgeable cultural reporting and analysis.   In 1995, cultural critic and longtime\u00a0 Village Voice \u00a0writer Ellen Willis responded to the rapid growth of this field by launching a concentration in Cultural Reporting and Criticism within the Institute's M.A. program. CRC is unique: the only graduate journalism program in the country specifically designed to prepare the next generation of cultural reporters and critics.   The program is dedicated to original, creative, cultural writing; The arts and books and popular culture; the immense variety of social groups, from gay families to Pakistani cabdrivers to obsessive gamers; the explosion of social controversies; the rise of religious fundamentalism, at home and abroad; the changing nature of war; the writer's own experience: all this is fodder for the cultural journalist. Cultural journalism is for writers with an itch to understand connections\u2014between news event and context, present and past, art and society, public and private. Over the last tumultuous decade, the need for such explorations has only intensified.   The CRC concentration is unique, too, in its emphasis on criticism. We are inspired not by the turgid academic criticism that is taught at some universities, but by the\u00a0 Partisan Review/New Yorker \u00a0tradition: that is, well-informed, thought-provoking, inventive criticism that addresses a wide, non-specialized audience and that can intervene in a broader cultural conversation. The critics and writers we study (pictured to the right) include Virginia Woolf, Hannah Arendt, Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, V.S Naipaul, Philip Gourevitch, Christopher Hitchens, Janet Malcolm, David Foster Wallace and Pauline Kael.   CRC students are trained to write in a variety of formats, including the cultural essay, the personal essay, the profile, the review, the long-form narrative, the sharp, stylish opinion piece, and the blog post. Graduates have gone on to work as writers, critics, or editors for a bevy of publications , including, currently, the New York Times , the\u00a0 New Yorker , the\u00a0 New Republic, \u00a0 ArtForum, the \u00a0New York Review of Books,The Paris Review, \u00a0 the\u00a0 Los Angeles Times , the \u00a0Daily News, \u00a0 Slate, Fader, Entertainment Weekly, Spin ,\u00a0and the\u00a0 Wall Street Journal,\u00a0 among other places. Several former students have published books: Lauren Sandler, Righteous: Dispatches from the Evangelical Youth Movement , and One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One ; Katheryn Joyce, The Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption , and Quiverfull; James Westcott, When Marina Abramovic Dies: A Biography ; Thomas Chatterton Williams, Losing My Cool: How a Father's Love and 15,000 Books Beat Hip-Hop Culture ; Juana Libedinsky, English Breakfast ; Ray Huling, Harvesting the Bay: Fathers, Sons, and the Last of the Wild Shellfishermen ; and Jason Bailey, Pulp Fiction: The Complete Story of Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece .   If you are drawn to the big picture\u2014if you suspect that neither conventional journalism training nor academic specialization is right for you\u2014CRC may be what you're looking for. Our curriculum emphasizes the integration of journalistic skills with the development of each individual writer's distinctive voice. The CRC program is deeply collaborative, and stresses close working relationships between professors and students and the creation of a supportive intellectual community.

  Journalism is not just about reporting on individual \"news events.\" More and more, it's about getting a handle on the complicated reality that frames those events - the ever-shifting patterns of culture that determine how we live and what we make of our lives. As the mainstream media expand their cultural coverage and alternative publications and websites proliferate, there has never been more need for engaging, knowledgeable cultural reporting and analysis.   In 1995, cultural critic and longtime\u00a0 Village Voice \u00a0writer Ellen Willis responded to the rapid growth of this field by launching a concentration in Cultural Reporting and Criticism within the Institute's M.A. program. CRC is unique: the only graduate journalism program in the country specifically designed to prepare the next generation of cultural reporters and critics.   The program is dedicated to original, creative, cultural writing; The arts and books and popular culture; the immense variety of social groups, from gay families to Pakistani cabdrivers to obsessive gamers; the explosion of social controversies; the rise of religious fundamentalism, at home and abroad; the changing nature of war; the writer's own experience: all this is fodder for the cultural journalist. Cultural journalism is for writers with an itch to understand connections\u2014between news event and context, present and past, art and society, public and private. Over the last tumultuous decade, the need for such explorations has only intensified.   The CRC concentration is unique, too, in its emphasis on criticism. We are inspired not by the turgid academic criticism that is taught at some universities, but by the\u00a0 Partisan Review/New Yorker \u00a0tradition: that is, well-informed, thought-provoking, inventive criticism that addresses a wide, non-specialized audience and that can intervene in a broader cultural conversation. The critics and writers we study (pictured to the right) include Virginia Woolf, Hannah Arendt, Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, V.S Naipaul, Philip Gourevitch, Christopher Hitchens, Janet Malcolm, David Foster Wallace and Pauline Kael.   CRC students are trained to write in a variety of formats, including the cultural essay, the personal essay, the profile, the review, the long-form narrative, the sharp, stylish opinion piece, and the blog post. Graduates have gone on to work as writers, critics, or editors for a bevy of publications , including, currently, the New York Times , the\u00a0 New Yorker , the\u00a0 New Republic, \u00a0 ArtForum, the \u00a0New York Review of Books,The Paris Review, \u00a0 the\u00a0 Los Angeles Times , the \u00a0Daily News, \u00a0 Slate, Fader, Entertainment Weekly, Spin ,\u00a0and the\u00a0 Wall Street Journal,\u00a0 among other places. Several former students have published books: Lauren Sandler, Righteous: Dispatches from the Evangelical Youth Movement , and One and Only: The Freedom of Having an Only Child, and the Joy of Being One ; Katheryn Joyce, The Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption , and Quiverfull; James Westcott, When Marina Abramovic Dies: A Biography ; Thomas Chatterton Williams, Losing My Cool: How a Father's Love and 15,000 Books Beat Hip-Hop Culture ; Juana Libedinsky, English Breakfast ; Ray Huling, Harvesting the Bay: Fathers, Sons, and the Last of the Wild Shellfishermen ; and Jason Bailey, Pulp Fiction: The Complete Story of Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece .   If you are drawn to the big picture\u2014if you suspect that neither conventional journalism training nor academic specialization is right for you\u2014CRC may be what you're looking for. Our curriculum emphasizes the integration of journalistic skills with the development of each individual writer's distinctive voice. The CRC program is deeply collaborative, and stresses close working relationships between professors and students and the creation of a supportive intellectual community.

The review is aimed at evaluating faculty in the following areas: research, publication, applied scholarship, creative works, teaching, service, and program administration. The purpose of the review is also to provide necessary feedback to further enhance faculty development and performance. Finally, personnel reviews are an additional evaluative tool used in determining annual merit increases. Third-year and tenure reviews are for pre-tenure faculty only and are mandated by the University. The third-year review provides a mid-career appraisal of the candidate's teaching, scholarship and service and includes the solicitation of evaluations from experts outside the University. The tenure review, which usually takes place in the sixth year on the tenure-track, is a thorough and rigorous academic personnel review process. It spans the entire career of the candidate and leads to the Provost's decision on whether or not to award tenure. All of the above reviews require the input of the faculty candidate, department chair, department personnel committee, and the Dean.    Annual Reviews    All faculty including untenured faculty are reviewed annualy as part of the AMI process. Untenured faculty who successfully pass the Third-Year Review are eligible for the Goddard Award .

Click here for the complete Personnel Policies and Procedures for Promotion, Tenure, and Review of Faculty.    Promotion and Tenure    The decision to grant tenure is one that is of central importance to an institution of higher education, where the quality of education is dependent upon the strength of the quality of the individuals appointed as members of the faculty. The duty of the tenured faculty to give advice on decisionsn of tenure following a rigorous and effective review is perhaps their highest responsibility. The process begins with their review, and it is highly dependent upon their thoroughness, fairness and rigor. There are no absolute criteria, given that individual personnel decisions are unique. However, the process must be on that is governed by clear, object, and equitable standards and procedures. At The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development faculty personnel decisions are based on consideration of quality of performance in relation to the achievement of the goals of the School in research, publication, creative work, instruction, and service. Service is considered with regard to the School, to the department, to the procession, and to the community through work in schools, health care settings, and cultural institutions.

For the Application for Promotion and/or Tenure Review, please click here (pdf).       Third Year Reviews    The purpose of the third year review is to provide junior faculty with constructive feedback and a candid assessment of their progress towards tenure. At least three letters are solicited from external reviewers, who are experts in the faculty member's discipline. The process itself, along with the feedback they receive, are meant to be a mechanism to help enhance the areas in which they may need improvement so that their chances for a successful tenure review are maximized. The materials which will comprise the third year review docket, will be reviewed by the department chair, members of the department personnel committee, and as mentioned above, external review experts.
