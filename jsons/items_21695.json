Our department has considerably expanded over the past few years, adding many outstanding faculty with diverse research interests. We are proud of our strong research and educational connections to other departments and schools at NYU, including the departments of Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology; the Center for Neural Science; the Stern School of Business; the Tisch School of the Arts; the Wagner School of Public Service; and the NYU School of Medicine.         Our undergraduate majors and MS students have numerous interesting and well-paying employment opportunities at major corporations in New York City and vicinity. Our PhD graduates are employed in a broad spectrum of academic and industrial research positions.              News and Highlights                        Remembering Prof. Jack Schwartz   One of the founders of the NYU Computer Science Department, Jack Schwartz, is remembered in a collection of reminiscences in the current issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society, including a contribution from Professor Emeritus Martin Davis.               2014-2015 Dean's Outstanding Dissertation Award   Dr. Russell Power has been awarded the 2014-2015 Dean's Outstanding Dissertation Award in the Sciences for his thesis \"Building efficient distributed in-memory systems\". His advisor was Jinyang Li. Congratulations!               2015 NYUAD Annual Hackathon   The fourth Annual NYUAD Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World , organized by Professor Sana Odeh, took place April 10-12. It drew over 100 students from a dozen countries worldwide.    For more news about the hackaton, see here .               ACM Fellow   Juliana Freire has been named a Fellow of ACM for contributions to provenance management research and technology, and computational reproducibility. Congratulations!    See the press release for more information.               ACM Distinguished Scientist   Clark Barrett has been named a 2014 Distinguished Scientist by the ACM. Congratulations!               2015 IEEE Donald G. Fink Award   Theodore Rappaport and his students have been awarded the 2015 IEEE Donald G. Fink Award for the outstanding survey, review, or tutorial paper in IEEE publications. Congratulations!              &lt;&lt;More News&gt;&gt;                    Learning and modeling the circuits that operate life: The Bonneau lab aims to learn large biological networks directly from genomics data (genomics =3D very scalable biology experiments). Our recent work, as part of collaborative teams of systems biologists and  computational biologists, has recently resulted in genome-wide models that are capable of simulating the functioning of the genome in real time (Bonneau, et. al, 2006, Cell). Dr. Bonneau's lab develops new algorithms that attempt to learn the regulatory networks (their topology and dynamical parameters) that are at the core of biological systems. This work was featured in a 2008 Discover Article, where Dr. Bonneau was selected as one of the top 20 scientists under 40. This work is collaborative work that relies on NYU's local expertise in Machine Learning, Modeling complex systems and their dynamics, and Genomics.  Links:   Bonneau Lab     With Ph.D. student Eugene Weinstein and Google researcher Pedro Moreno, Mehryar Mohri is working on audio fingerprinting techniques that enable computers to recognize songs. This work represents songs in terms of \"music phonemes\", elementary units of music sound that are learned from data, and uses weighted finite-state transducers to construct a compact and efficient index of a large database of songs. The image depicts an example of such a transducer. As a result, songs can be recognized quickly and accurately when only a recording of a short \"audio snippet\" is available and even when the recording is distorted. The group has created a working system with a database of 15,000 songs. Moreover, it has proven new bounds on the size of the indexing finite automata used that guarantee the compactness of this representation as the number of songs indexed increases and suggests that their techniques scale to much larger song data sets.
