Fall matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect for the fall term in which they entered Gallatin.   Spring matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect during the fall term immediately preceding their enrollment.   Summer matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect for the fall term immediately following their enrollment.     Transfer Students   Degree requirements for students transferring from a school or college within the University are those that are in effect when they first matriculate at Gallatin.   Readmitted Students   Students who are readmitted must fulfill the degree requirements that are in effect when they are readmitted, unless their offer of readmission states otherwise.   Note: Students who matriculated prior to Summer 2011, should reference the Degree Requirements Archive.          Tracking Completion of Degree Requirements   Students are responsible for tracking their progress toward their degree by viewing their Academic Requirements report (also called degree audit), which is available on Albert, NYU\u2019s online student information system. The Academic Requirements report will tell students which requirements they have completed and which are still outstanding. The Office of the University Registrar provides instructions for accessing the Academic Requirements report .               Total Units     To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree, students must complete 128 units within 10 years of matriculating at Gallatin. A minimum of 64 units must be completed after matriculation at Gallatin.           Academic Good Standing     Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 to remain in academic good standing. A final minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 is required for graduation. .     Please note: Academic good standing is not the same as satisfactory academic progress. Satisfactory academic progress refers to the academic requirement students must meet to maintain eligibility for financial aid. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information on satisfactory academic progress .           Undergraduate Core (UG) Requirement     Students must complete 32 units in Gallatin School courses, all of which contain the letters \u201cUG\u201d in the course subject area. In fulfilling this requirement, students must earn 4 units in the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, 4 units in First-Year Writing Seminar, 4 units in First-Year or Transfer Student Research Seminar, and 16 units in interdisciplinary seminars. Please note the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar counts as an interdisciplinary seminar; thus first-year students who have completed a First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar are only required to complete 12 units in Interdisciplinary Seminars.   Any remaining units may be taken in other Gallatin curricular offerings, including additional interdisciplinary seminars, advanced writing courses; arts workshops; practicum courses; community learning courses; travel courses, and individualized projects (independent studies, tutorials, internships, and private lessons).   Students may not take the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, First-Year Writing Seminar, First-Year Research Seminar or the Transfer Student Research Seminar on a pass/fail basis.    Transfer students who enter with 32 or more units may substitute another Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar for the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar. Transfer students who have completed one or two expository writing courses may substitute these units with other Gallatin courses; transfer students who are required to take a research seminar should enroll in the Transfer Student Research Seminar.     Students transitioning to Gallatin from The Liberal Studies Core Program of the Faculty of Arts and Science in or after summer 2013 are required to complete a minimum of 32 units in Gallatin, 16 of which must be earned in interdisciplinary seminars.Students transitioning to Gallatin from The Liberal Studies Core Program of the Faculty of Arts and Science prior to summer 2013 are required to complete a minimum of 24 units in Gallatin courses, 16 of which must be earned in interdisciplinary seminars.            Foundation Requirement     All students must complete a foundation requirement, which is comprised of two areas: the liberal arts foundation and the historical and cultural foundation. Some courses may satisfy more than one foundation requirement (for example, a course may satisfy the humanities area of the liberal arts requirement, as well as the pre-modern area of the historical and cultural foundation). In this example, both requirements would be satisfied by the completion of the one course.     Courses taken to fulfill the foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. Transfer students will have their transcripts reviewed on admission to determine which, if any, of the foundation requirements they have fulfilled. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the foundation requirement.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the Foundation Requirement is available on the Gallatin Courses page . Please note that individualized projects (i.e. independent studies, tutorials, etc.) do not fulfill any area of the foundation requirement.     A list of other NYU departments and courses that satisfy an area of the Foundation Requirement is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .            Liberal Arts Foundation   The liberal arts foundation must be distributed as follows: 8 units in the humanities; 8 units in the social sciences; and 4 units in either mathematics or science.   To fulfill the liberal arts foundation, students may take courses in Gallatin, as well as in several departments and programs of the University.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the liberal arts foundation is available on the Gallatin Courses page .     A list of other NYU departments and courses that satisfy an area of the liberal arts foundation is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .     Courses taken to fulfill the liberal arts foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. Transfer students will have their transcripts reviewed on admission to determine which, if any, of the liberal arts requirements they have fulfilled. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the liberal arts foundation requirement.          Historical and Cultural Foundation   This requirement is designed to help students think historically\u2014and culturally---about their concentration work. To that end, students are required to take at least 4 units of coursework in the 'pre-modern' period, 4 units in the 'early modern' period, and 4 units in \u2018global cultures.\u2019        Students are expected to complete one course in each of the areas of historical and cultural requirement for a total of 12 units. While some courses may satisfy multiple areas of the historical and cultural foundation (i.e. global cultures and premodern), only one of these areas will be counted toward the requirement (in this example, either global cultures or premodern, but not both).   Courses taken to fulfill the historical and cultural foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the historical and cultural foundation requirement.   To fulfill this requirement, students may take courses in Gallatin, as well as several CAS departments and programs.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the historical and cultural foundation is available on the Gallatin Courses page .     A list of CAS departments and courses that satisfy the historical and cultural foundation requirement is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .       More information about the pre-modern, early modern, and global cultures areas is available below:                                                    Pre-Modern Period                                 The 'pre-modern' period traditionally extends from the world of antiquity, from the earliest records of human civilization up to the emergence of early modern social, political, and technological regimes (14th-16th centuries CE). It is common to include under this vast temporal umbrella such disparate phenomena as the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, the Middle East and South Asia; the societies and cultures of the European 'Middle Ages'; the Mayan and Incan civilizations of South and Central America; pre-Ming dynasty China; the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates of the Middle East, north Africa, and Spain. Students of the pre-modern world might expect to study (among many possibilities) Classical Greek philosophy and drama, Ancient Mediterranean wisdom Literature, Epic poetry and romance, the interplay of oral and written cultures, the Han legacy in the East, the Roman legacy in the West, heresy and the institutionalization of religion, the rise of Islam, crusade, the flourishing of scientific learning at Baghdad and Cordoba.   Examples of &quot;Pre-modern&quot; courses include &quot;Ancient Theatre and Its Influences,&quot; &quot;Reading the Faces of Ancient Cultures,&quot; &quot;The Arabian Nights,&quot; &quot;The History of Kindness,&quot; &quot;Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures,&quot; &quot;Civilization and Culture of the Middle Ages,&quot; &quot;Classical Mythology,&quot; &quot;The Oases of Egypt,&quot; &quot;East Asian Art I: China, Korea, Japan to 1000 CE,&quot; &quot;Introduction to Ancient Indian Literature.&quot;   **It is important to understand that 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' are categories created by Western scholars to describe cultural, political, social, and economic differences across vast periods of time. For this reason, these categories are not fixed, and they vary across disciplines and geographic regions. In other words, while the terms 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' can be useful for exploring the diversity and development of ideas across time, they also invite debate, discussion, and interrogation.                                                              Early Modern Period                                 The 'early modern' period is understood to begin in many regions around the 14th century, and to continue to the 18th century, or, depending on geographic region, to the late 18th or 19th century CE. It describes the era from the invention of the printing press to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, from the early contact of European explorers with the Americas to the American Revolution. It marks the beginning of world exploration and the expansion of world trade, the beginning of a global economic system; and the beginning of European colonialism, including the Atlantic Slave trade. It is common to associate this period with, for some examples, the European Renaissance, the Ottoman Empire, the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan, the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China, colonial Latin America, the colonial and early revolutionary culture of the United States.   Examples of &quot;Early modern&quot; courses include &quot;Literature of Rebellion in Early Modern Europe,&quot; &quot;Machiavelli's Prince,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare and the London Theater,&quot; &quot;History of Environmental Sciences,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare's Mediterranean: Britain, Islam and the Early Modern Mediterranean World,&quot; &quot;Family and Gender in Late Medieval and Renaissance Italy,&quot; &quot;Magic, Religion, and the Inquisition,&quot; &quot;Two Mediterranean Worlds: Christendom and Islam,&quot; &quot;Early Masters of Italian Renaissance Painting.&quot;   **It is important to understand that 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' are categories created by Western scholars to describe cultural, political, social, and economic differences across vast periods of time. For this reason, these categories are not fixed, and they vary across disciplines and geographic regions. In other words, while the terms 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' can be useful for exploring the diversity and development of ideas across time, they also invite debate, discussion, and interrogation.                                                              Global Cultures                               To expand their cultural knowledge, Gallatin students are required to stretch beyond the cultures that are most familiar to them, and take (at least) 4 units of coursework in classes dealing with the beliefs, practices, literatures, or intellectual traditions found in cultures beyond the boundaries of, in general, the United States and Western Europe. Students are encouraged to take classes that address the various cultures of Africa, Latin America, and Asia.   Examples of courses that fulfill the &quot;Global Cultures&quot; requirement include: &quot;Consuming the Caribbean,&quot; &quot;Imagining India: From the Colonial to the Global,&quot; &quot;Postcolonial African Cities,&quot; &quot;(Re) Imagining Latin America,&quot; &quot;Sociology of Religion: Islam and the Modern World,&quot; &quot;The Dangerous Women in Japanese Literature,&quot; &quot;The (Post)Colonial Arabic Novel,&quot; &quot;Israeli Cinema,&quot; &quot;Czech Art and Architecture,&quot; &quot;The Art of Russian Avant-Garde.&quot;                                Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration     Students are required to write a two- to three-page essay called the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration by the end of the semester in which they complete the 64th unit toward the B.A. degree. Students who enter with 64 transfer credits are required to complete the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration by the end of their first semester at Gallatin. Students write the essay in consultation with their adviser, and the essay must be approved by the adviser.     This essay has several purposes. First, students are expected to compose an intellectual history that describes the trajectory of their interests and education thus far. Second, students are asked to frame a plan for future study, including classroom course work and individualized projects. In constructing this essay, students should describe their educational experiences, the central idea or ideas informing their concentration, and the course work relevant to their concentration. Finally, this essay should be understood as an opportunity for students to reflect on how they learn as individuals and to consider what they find academically interesting and worthwhile.     For more information about this topic, see Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration .           Senior Colloquium     Students must successfully complete a two-hour presentation and discussion with the student\u2019s adviser and two other faculty members. Both the rationale and booklist serve as the main focus of the discussion in the colloquium.     Rationale and Booklist     Students are required to submit (1) a three-to five-page adviser-approved rationale about the topic or topics to be discussed in the colloquium and (2) a booklist consisting of 20-25 books representing several academic disciplines and historical periods related to the theme or themes described in the rationale. Both the rational and booklist require approval from the student's adviser and the Gallatin School.     For more information about this topic, see Colloquium .          Classroom Unit Requirement     Students must complete at least 64 units in classroom courses. Transfer credits and course equivalency generally count toward this 64-unit requirement, but independent study, tutorial, internship, and private lesson credits do not.           Residency Requirements     A minimum of 64 units of coursework must be completed after matriculation in Gallatin.   In addition, students are required to complete their last 32 units at NYU, through courses at NYU in New York City or at an NYU study away program. Students who wish to study abroad through a school other than NYU or who wish to take courses outside of NYU should either do so before they complete 96 units or file a petiion asking to be waived from the requirement. Such arrangements require prior permission, which may be requested by submitting an External Study application (and petition, if necessary) to the Gallatin Office of Global Programs , 411 Lafayette Street, 3rd Floor.              Limitations          Time Limit for Completion of the Bachelor's Degree   Undergraduate students must complete all degree requirements within a period of 10 years  from the first semester of matriculation at Gallatin.   For students who are readmitted, the original period of matriculation is counted toward  the 10-year limit; the hiatus is not counted, and the clock resumes upon readmission.        Transfer Credit Maximum   A student may apply a maximum of 64 transfer units toward his or her Gallatin degree. Included in this maximum are all units earned prior to admission to Gallatin (including Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Maturity Exam Certificate, etc.), any non-NYU units a student may be approved to take after matriculation at Gallatin, as well as units granted for course equivalency. Please note: all Gallatin degree candidates must complete a minimum of 64 units after matriculation at Gallatin and must satisfy all other degree requirements.   For more information about transfer credit, please see Advanced Placement and other pre-college credit .        Course Equivalency Maximum Units   Undergraduate students may earn a maximum of 32 course equivalency credits for professional experiences they have had before matriculating in Gallatin. Course equivalency credits will be applied toward the transfer credit limit. The number of course equivalency and transfer credits combined may not exceed 64 units. Course equivalency credit does not count toward the undergraduate residency requirement   See Course Equivalency for more information about how to apply for this credit.        Business Courses Maximum Units   No more than 31 units in business courses can count towards the Gallatin BA degree. This includes business courses in the Stern School, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and those transferred from other colleges and universities.        Private Lessons Maximum Units   Undergraduate students may take a maximum of 24 units in private lessons during their studies at the Gallatin School. Included in this total will be units earned from Gallatin Private Lessons (INDIV-UG 1701) as well as units earned from Steinhardt music courses noted as \u201cindividual instruction in the performing arts\u201d (e.g., Participation in NYU Orchestra, Vocal Training (Private Lessons), etc.).        Internship Maximum Units   Students admitted to the Gallatin School in Summer 2015 and later may take a maximum of 24 units in internship during their studies at the Gallatin School.                    top of page                       Degree Requirements Archive                      Select an Option...

Fall matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect for the fall term in which they entered Gallatin.   Spring matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect during the fall term immediately preceding their enrollment.   Summer matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect for the fall term immediately following their enrollment.     Transfer Students   Degree requirements for students transferring from a school or college within the University are those that are in effect when they first matriculate at Gallatin.   Readmitted Students   Students who are readmitted must fulfill the degree requirements that are in effect when they are readmitted, unless their offer of readmission states otherwise.   Note: Students who matriculated prior to Summer 2011, should reference the Degree Requirements Archive.          Tracking Completion of Degree Requirements   Students are responsible for tracking their progress toward their degree by viewing their Academic Requirements report (also called degree audit), which is available on Albert, NYU\u2019s online student information system. The Academic Requirements report will tell students which requirements they have completed and which are still outstanding. The Office of the University Registrar provides instructions for accessing the Academic Requirements report .               Total Units     To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree, students must complete 128 units within 10 years of matriculating at Gallatin. A minimum of 64 units must be completed after matriculation at Gallatin.           Academic Good Standing     Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 to remain in academic good standing. A final minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 is required for graduation. .     Please note: Academic good standing is not the same as satisfactory academic progress. Satisfactory academic progress refers to the academic requirement students must meet to maintain eligibility for financial aid. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information on satisfactory academic progress .           Undergraduate Core (UG) Requirement     Students must complete 32 units in Gallatin School courses, all of which contain the letters \u201cUG\u201d in the course subject area. In fulfilling this requirement, students must earn 4 units in the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, 4 units in First-Year Writing Seminar, 4 units in First-Year or Transfer Student Research Seminar, and 16 units in interdisciplinary seminars. Please note the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar counts as an interdisciplinary seminar; thus first-year students who have completed a First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar are only required to complete 12 units in Interdisciplinary Seminars.   Any remaining units may be taken in other Gallatin curricular offerings, including additional interdisciplinary seminars, advanced writing courses; arts workshops; practicum courses; community learning courses; travel courses, and individualized projects (independent studies, tutorials, internships, and private lessons).   Students may not take the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, First-Year Writing Seminar, First-Year Research Seminar or the Transfer Student Research Seminar on a pass/fail basis.    Transfer students who enter with 32 or more units may substitute another Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar for the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar. Transfer students who have completed one or two expository writing courses may substitute these units with other Gallatin courses; transfer students who are required to take a research seminar should enroll in the Transfer Student Research Seminar.     Students transitioning to Gallatin from The Liberal Studies Core Program of the Faculty of Arts and Science in or after summer 2013 are required to complete a minimum of 32 units in Gallatin, 16 of which must be earned in interdisciplinary seminars.Students transitioning to Gallatin from The Liberal Studies Core Program of the Faculty of Arts and Science prior to summer 2013 are required to complete a minimum of 24 units in Gallatin courses, 16 of which must be earned in interdisciplinary seminars.            Foundation Requirement     All students must complete a foundation requirement, which is comprised of two areas: the liberal arts foundation and the historical and cultural foundation. Some courses may satisfy more than one foundation requirement (for example, a course may satisfy the humanities area of the liberal arts requirement, as well as the pre-modern area of the historical and cultural foundation). In this example, both requirements would be satisfied by the completion of the one course.     Courses taken to fulfill the foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. Transfer students will have their transcripts reviewed on admission to determine which, if any, of the foundation requirements they have fulfilled. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the foundation requirement.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the Foundation Requirement is available on the Gallatin Courses page . Please note that individualized projects (i.e. independent studies, tutorials, etc.) do not fulfill any area of the foundation requirement.     A list of other NYU departments and courses that satisfy an area of the Foundation Requirement is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .            Liberal Arts Foundation   The liberal arts foundation must be distributed as follows: 8 units in the humanities; 8 units in the social sciences; and 4 units in either mathematics or science.   To fulfill the liberal arts foundation, students may take courses in Gallatin, as well as in several departments and programs of the University.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the liberal arts foundation is available on the Gallatin Courses page .     A list of other NYU departments and courses that satisfy an area of the liberal arts foundation is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .     Courses taken to fulfill the liberal arts foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. Transfer students will have their transcripts reviewed on admission to determine which, if any, of the liberal arts requirements they have fulfilled. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the liberal arts foundation requirement.          Historical and Cultural Foundation   This requirement is designed to help students think historically\u2014and culturally---about their concentration work. To that end, students are required to take at least 4 units of coursework in the 'pre-modern' period, 4 units in the 'early modern' period, and 4 units in \u2018global cultures.\u2019        Students are expected to complete one course in each of the areas of historical and cultural requirement for a total of 12 units. While some courses may satisfy multiple areas of the historical and cultural foundation (i.e. global cultures and premodern), only one of these areas will be counted toward the requirement (in this example, either global cultures or premodern, but not both).   Courses taken to fulfill the historical and cultural foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the historical and cultural foundation requirement.   To fulfill this requirement, students may take courses in Gallatin, as well as several CAS departments and programs.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the historical and cultural foundation is available on the Gallatin Courses page .     A list of CAS departments and courses that satisfy the historical and cultural foundation requirement is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .       More information about the pre-modern, early modern, and global cultures areas is available below:                                                    Pre-Modern Period                                 The 'pre-modern' period traditionally extends from the world of antiquity, from the earliest records of human civilization up to the emergence of early modern social, political, and technological regimes (14th-16th centuries CE). It is common to include under this vast temporal umbrella such disparate phenomena as the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, the Middle East and South Asia; the societies and cultures of the European 'Middle Ages'; the Mayan and Incan civilizations of South and Central America; pre-Ming dynasty China; the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates of the Middle East, north Africa, and Spain. Students of the pre-modern world might expect to study (among many possibilities) Classical Greek philosophy and drama, Ancient Mediterranean wisdom Literature, Epic poetry and romance, the interplay of oral and written cultures, the Han legacy in the East, the Roman legacy in the West, heresy and the institutionalization of religion, the rise of Islam, crusade, the flourishing of scientific learning at Baghdad and Cordoba.   Examples of &quot;Pre-modern&quot; courses include &quot;Ancient Theatre and Its Influences,&quot; &quot;Reading the Faces of Ancient Cultures,&quot; &quot;The Arabian Nights,&quot; &quot;The History of Kindness,&quot; &quot;Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures,&quot; &quot;Civilization and Culture of the Middle Ages,&quot; &quot;Classical Mythology,&quot; &quot;The Oases of Egypt,&quot; &quot;East Asian Art I: China, Korea, Japan to 1000 CE,&quot; &quot;Introduction to Ancient Indian Literature.&quot;   **It is important to understand that 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' are categories created by Western scholars to describe cultural, political, social, and economic differences across vast periods of time. For this reason, these categories are not fixed, and they vary across disciplines and geographic regions. In other words, while the terms 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' can be useful for exploring the diversity and development of ideas across time, they also invite debate, discussion, and interrogation.                                                              Early Modern Period                                 The 'early modern' period is understood to begin in many regions around the 14th century, and to continue to the 18th century, or, depending on geographic region, to the late 18th or 19th century CE. It describes the era from the invention of the printing press to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, from the early contact of European explorers with the Americas to the American Revolution. It marks the beginning of world exploration and the expansion of world trade, the beginning of a global economic system; and the beginning of European colonialism, including the Atlantic Slave trade. It is common to associate this period with, for some examples, the European Renaissance, the Ottoman Empire, the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan, the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China, colonial Latin America, the colonial and early revolutionary culture of the United States.   Examples of &quot;Early modern&quot; courses include &quot;Literature of Rebellion in Early Modern Europe,&quot; &quot;Machiavelli's Prince,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare and the London Theater,&quot; &quot;History of Environmental Sciences,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare's Mediterranean: Britain, Islam and the Early Modern Mediterranean World,&quot; &quot;Family and Gender in Late Medieval and Renaissance Italy,&quot; &quot;Magic, Religion, and the Inquisition,&quot; &quot;Two Mediterranean Worlds: Christendom and Islam,&quot; &quot;Early Masters of Italian Renaissance Painting.&quot;   **It is important to understand that 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' are categories created by Western scholars to describe cultural, political, social, and economic differences across vast periods of time. For this reason, these categories are not fixed, and they vary across disciplines and geographic regions. In other words, while the terms 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' can be useful for exploring the diversity and development of ideas across time, they also invite debate, discussion, and interrogation.                                                              Global Cultures                               To expand their cultural knowledge, Gallatin students are required to stretch beyond the cultures that are most familiar to them, and take (at least) 4 units of coursework in classes dealing with the beliefs, practices, literatures, or intellectual traditions found in cultures beyond the boundaries of, in general, the United States and Western Europe. Students are encouraged to take classes that address the various cultures of Africa, Latin America, and Asia.   Examples of courses that fulfill the &quot;Global Cultures&quot; requirement include: &quot;Consuming the Caribbean,&quot; &quot;Imagining India: From the Colonial to the Global,&quot; &quot;Postcolonial African Cities,&quot; &quot;(Re) Imagining Latin America,&quot; &quot;Sociology of Religion: Islam and the Modern World,&quot; &quot;The Dangerous Women in Japanese Literature,&quot; &quot;The (Post)Colonial Arabic Novel,&quot; &quot;Israeli Cinema,&quot; &quot;Czech Art and Architecture,&quot; &quot;The Art of Russian Avant-Garde.&quot;                                Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration     Students are required to write a two- to three-page essay called the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration by the end of the semester in which they complete the 64th unit toward the B.A. degree. Students who enter with 64 transfer credits are required to complete the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration by the end of their first semester at Gallatin. Students write the essay in consultation with their adviser, and the essay must be approved by the adviser.     This essay has several purposes. First, students are expected to compose an intellectual history that describes the trajectory of their interests and education thus far. Second, students are asked to frame a plan for future study, including classroom course work and individualized projects. In constructing this essay, students should describe their educational experiences, the central idea or ideas informing their concentration, and the course work relevant to their concentration. Finally, this essay should be understood as an opportunity for students to reflect on how they learn as individuals and to consider what they find academically interesting and worthwhile.     For more information about this topic, see Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration .           Senior Colloquium     Students must successfully complete a two-hour presentation and discussion with the student\u2019s adviser and two other faculty members. Both the rationale and booklist serve as the main focus of the discussion in the colloquium.     Rationale and Booklist     Students are required to submit (1) a three-to five-page adviser-approved rationale about the topic or topics to be discussed in the colloquium and (2) a booklist consisting of 20-25 books representing several academic disciplines and historical periods related to the theme or themes described in the rationale. Both the rational and booklist require approval from the student's adviser and the Gallatin School.     For more information about this topic, see Colloquium .          Classroom Unit Requirement     Students must complete at least 64 units in classroom courses. Transfer credits and course equivalency generally count toward this 64-unit requirement, but independent study, tutorial, internship, and private lesson credits do not.           Residency Requirements     A minimum of 64 units of coursework must be completed after matriculation in Gallatin.   In addition, students are required to complete their last 32 units at NYU, through courses at NYU in New York City or at an NYU study away program. Students who wish to study abroad through a school other than NYU or who wish to take courses outside of NYU should either do so before they complete 96 units or file a petiion asking to be waived from the requirement. Such arrangements require prior permission, which may be requested by submitting an External Study application (and petition, if necessary) to the Gallatin Office of Global Programs , 411 Lafayette Street, 3rd Floor.              Limitations          Time Limit for Completion of the Bachelor's Degree   Undergraduate students must complete all degree requirements within a period of 10 years  from the first semester of matriculation at Gallatin.   For students who are readmitted, the original period of matriculation is counted toward  the 10-year limit; the hiatus is not counted, and the clock resumes upon readmission.        Transfer Credit Maximum   A student may apply a maximum of 64 transfer units toward his or her Gallatin degree. Included in this maximum are all units earned prior to admission to Gallatin (including Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Maturity Exam Certificate, etc.), any non-NYU units a student may be approved to take after matriculation at Gallatin, as well as units granted for course equivalency. Please note: all Gallatin degree candidates must complete a minimum of 64 units after matriculation at Gallatin and must satisfy all other degree requirements.   For more information about transfer credit, please see Advanced Placement and other pre-college credit .        Course Equivalency Maximum Units   Undergraduate students may earn a maximum of 32 course equivalency credits for professional experiences they have had before matriculating in Gallatin. Course equivalency credits will be applied toward the transfer credit limit. The number of course equivalency and transfer credits combined may not exceed 64 units. Course equivalency credit does not count toward the undergraduate residency requirement   See Course Equivalency for more information about how to apply for this credit.        Business Courses Maximum Units   No more than 31 units in business courses can count towards the Gallatin BA degree. This includes business courses in the Stern School, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and those transferred from other colleges and universities.        Private Lessons Maximum Units   Undergraduate students may take a maximum of 24 units in private lessons during their studies at the Gallatin School. Included in this total will be units earned from Gallatin Private Lessons (INDIV-UG 1701) as well as units earned from Steinhardt music courses noted as \u201cindividual instruction in the performing arts\u201d (e.g., Participation in NYU Orchestra, Vocal Training (Private Lessons), etc.).        Internship Maximum Units   Students admitted to the Gallatin School in Summer 2015 and later may take a maximum of 24 units in internship during their studies at the Gallatin School.                    top of page                       Degree Requirements Archive                      Select an Option...

EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

Fall matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect for the fall term in which they entered Gallatin.   Spring matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect during the fall term immediately preceding their enrollment.   Summer matriculants will be bound by the degree requirements in effect for the fall term immediately following their enrollment.     Transfer Students   Degree requirements for students transferring from a school or college within the University are those that are in effect when they first matriculate at Gallatin.   Readmitted Students   Students who are readmitted must fulfill the degree requirements that are in effect when they are readmitted, unless their offer of readmission states otherwise.   Note: Students who matriculated prior to Summer 2011, should reference the Degree Requirements Archive.          Tracking Completion of Degree Requirements   Students are responsible for tracking their progress toward their degree by viewing their Academic Requirements report (also called degree audit), which is available on Albert, NYU\u2019s online student information system. The Academic Requirements report will tell students which requirements they have completed and which are still outstanding. The Office of the University Registrar provides instructions for accessing the Academic Requirements report .               Total Units     To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree, students must complete 128 units within 10 years of matriculating at Gallatin. A minimum of 64 units must be completed after matriculation at Gallatin.           Academic Good Standing     Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 to remain in academic good standing. A final minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 is required for graduation. .     Please note: Academic good standing is not the same as satisfactory academic progress. Satisfactory academic progress refers to the academic requirement students must meet to maintain eligibility for financial aid. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information on satisfactory academic progress .           Undergraduate Core (UG) Requirement     Students must complete 32 units in Gallatin School courses, all of which contain the letters \u201cUG\u201d in the course subject area. In fulfilling this requirement, students must earn 4 units in the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, 4 units in First-Year Writing Seminar, 4 units in First-Year or Transfer Student Research Seminar, and 16 units in interdisciplinary seminars. Please note the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar counts as an interdisciplinary seminar; thus first-year students who have completed a First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar are only required to complete 12 units in Interdisciplinary Seminars.   Any remaining units may be taken in other Gallatin curricular offerings, including additional interdisciplinary seminars, advanced writing courses; arts workshops; practicum courses; community learning courses; travel courses, and individualized projects (independent studies, tutorials, internships, and private lessons).   Students may not take the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, First-Year Writing Seminar, First-Year Research Seminar or the Transfer Student Research Seminar on a pass/fail basis.    Transfer students who enter with 32 or more units may substitute another Gallatin interdisciplinary seminar for the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar. Transfer students who have completed one or two expository writing courses may substitute these units with other Gallatin courses; transfer students who are required to take a research seminar should enroll in the Transfer Student Research Seminar.     Students transitioning to Gallatin from The Liberal Studies Core Program of the Faculty of Arts and Science in or after summer 2013 are required to complete a minimum of 32 units in Gallatin, 16 of which must be earned in interdisciplinary seminars.Students transitioning to Gallatin from The Liberal Studies Core Program of the Faculty of Arts and Science prior to summer 2013 are required to complete a minimum of 24 units in Gallatin courses, 16 of which must be earned in interdisciplinary seminars.            Foundation Requirement     All students must complete a foundation requirement, which is comprised of two areas: the liberal arts foundation and the historical and cultural foundation. Some courses may satisfy more than one foundation requirement (for example, a course may satisfy the humanities area of the liberal arts requirement, as well as the pre-modern area of the historical and cultural foundation). In this example, both requirements would be satisfied by the completion of the one course.     Courses taken to fulfill the foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. Transfer students will have their transcripts reviewed on admission to determine which, if any, of the foundation requirements they have fulfilled. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the foundation requirement.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the Foundation Requirement is available on the Gallatin Courses page . Please note that individualized projects (i.e. independent studies, tutorials, etc.) do not fulfill any area of the foundation requirement.     A list of other NYU departments and courses that satisfy an area of the Foundation Requirement is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .            Liberal Arts Foundation   The liberal arts foundation must be distributed as follows: 8 units in the humanities; 8 units in the social sciences; and 4 units in either mathematics or science.   To fulfill the liberal arts foundation, students may take courses in Gallatin, as well as in several departments and programs of the University.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the liberal arts foundation is available on the Gallatin Courses page .     A list of other NYU departments and courses that satisfy an area of the liberal arts foundation is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .     Courses taken to fulfill the liberal arts foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. Transfer students will have their transcripts reviewed on admission to determine which, if any, of the liberal arts requirements they have fulfilled. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the liberal arts foundation requirement.          Historical and Cultural Foundation   This requirement is designed to help students think historically\u2014and culturally---about their concentration work. To that end, students are required to take at least 4 units of coursework in the 'pre-modern' period, 4 units in the 'early modern' period, and 4 units in \u2018global cultures.\u2019        Students are expected to complete one course in each of the areas of historical and cultural requirement for a total of 12 units. While some courses may satisfy multiple areas of the historical and cultural foundation (i.e. global cultures and premodern), only one of these areas will be counted toward the requirement (in this example, either global cultures or premodern, but not both).   Courses taken to fulfill the historical and cultural foundation requirement may not be taken on a pass/fail basis. AP course credit/unit and units earned from other similar programs may not be used to fulfill the historical and cultural foundation requirement.   To fulfill this requirement, students may take courses in Gallatin, as well as several CAS departments and programs.     A list of Gallatin interdisciplinary seminars that may be counted toward the historical and cultural foundation is available on the Gallatin Courses page .     A list of CAS departments and courses that satisfy the historical and cultural foundation requirement is available on the Foundation Requirement Courses page .       More information about the pre-modern, early modern, and global cultures areas is available below:                                                    Pre-Modern Period                                 The 'pre-modern' period traditionally extends from the world of antiquity, from the earliest records of human civilization up to the emergence of early modern social, political, and technological regimes (14th-16th centuries CE). It is common to include under this vast temporal umbrella such disparate phenomena as the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, the Middle East and South Asia; the societies and cultures of the European 'Middle Ages'; the Mayan and Incan civilizations of South and Central America; pre-Ming dynasty China; the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates of the Middle East, north Africa, and Spain. Students of the pre-modern world might expect to study (among many possibilities) Classical Greek philosophy and drama, Ancient Mediterranean wisdom Literature, Epic poetry and romance, the interplay of oral and written cultures, the Han legacy in the East, the Roman legacy in the West, heresy and the institutionalization of religion, the rise of Islam, crusade, the flourishing of scientific learning at Baghdad and Cordoba.   Examples of &quot;Pre-modern&quot; courses include &quot;Ancient Theatre and Its Influences,&quot; &quot;Reading the Faces of Ancient Cultures,&quot; &quot;The Arabian Nights,&quot; &quot;The History of Kindness,&quot; &quot;Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures,&quot; &quot;Civilization and Culture of the Middle Ages,&quot; &quot;Classical Mythology,&quot; &quot;The Oases of Egypt,&quot; &quot;East Asian Art I: China, Korea, Japan to 1000 CE,&quot; &quot;Introduction to Ancient Indian Literature.&quot;   **It is important to understand that 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' are categories created by Western scholars to describe cultural, political, social, and economic differences across vast periods of time. For this reason, these categories are not fixed, and they vary across disciplines and geographic regions. In other words, while the terms 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' can be useful for exploring the diversity and development of ideas across time, they also invite debate, discussion, and interrogation.                                                              Early Modern Period                                 The 'early modern' period is understood to begin in many regions around the 14th century, and to continue to the 18th century, or, depending on geographic region, to the late 18th or 19th century CE. It describes the era from the invention of the printing press to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, from the early contact of European explorers with the Americas to the American Revolution. It marks the beginning of world exploration and the expansion of world trade, the beginning of a global economic system; and the beginning of European colonialism, including the Atlantic Slave trade. It is common to associate this period with, for some examples, the European Renaissance, the Ottoman Empire, the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan, the Ming and Qing Dynasties in China, colonial Latin America, the colonial and early revolutionary culture of the United States.   Examples of &quot;Early modern&quot; courses include &quot;Literature of Rebellion in Early Modern Europe,&quot; &quot;Machiavelli's Prince,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare and the London Theater,&quot; &quot;History of Environmental Sciences,&quot; &quot;Shakespeare's Mediterranean: Britain, Islam and the Early Modern Mediterranean World,&quot; &quot;Family and Gender in Late Medieval and Renaissance Italy,&quot; &quot;Magic, Religion, and the Inquisition,&quot; &quot;Two Mediterranean Worlds: Christendom and Islam,&quot; &quot;Early Masters of Italian Renaissance Painting.&quot;   **It is important to understand that 'pre-modern' and 'early modern' are categories created by Western scholars to describe cultural, political, social, and economic differences across vast periods of time. For this reason, these categories are not fixed, and they vary across disciplines and geographic regions.

Global Cultures                               To expand their cultural knowledge, Gallatin students are required to stretch beyond the cultures that are most familiar to them, and take (at least) 4 units of coursework in classes dealing with the beliefs, practices, literatures, or intellectual traditions found in cultures beyond the boundaries of, in general, the United States and Western Europe. Students are encouraged to take classes that address the various cultures of Africa, Latin America, and Asia.   Examples of courses that fulfill the &quot;Global Cultures&quot; requirement include: &quot;Consuming the Caribbean,&quot; &quot;Imagining India: From the Colonial to the Global,&quot; &quot;Postcolonial African Cities,&quot; &quot;(Re) Imagining Latin America,&quot; &quot;Sociology of Religion: Islam and the Modern World,&quot; &quot;The Dangerous Women in Japanese Literature,&quot; &quot;The (Post)Colonial Arabic Novel,&quot; &quot;Israeli Cinema,&quot; &quot;Czech Art and Architecture,&quot; &quot;The Art of Russian Avant-Garde.&quot;                                Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration     Students are required to write a two- to three-page essay called the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration by the end of the semester in which they complete the 64th unit toward the B.A. degree. Students who enter with 64 transfer credits are required to complete the Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration by the end of their first semester at Gallatin. Students write the essay in consultation with their adviser, and the essay must be approved by the adviser.     This essay has several purposes. First, students are expected to compose an intellectual history that describes the trajectory of their interests and education thus far. Second, students are asked to frame a plan for future study, including classroom course work and individualized projects. In constructing this essay, students should describe their educational experiences, the central idea or ideas informing their concentration, and the course work relevant to their concentration. Finally, this essay should be understood as an opportunity for students to reflect on how they learn as individuals and to consider what they find academically interesting and worthwhile.     For more information about this topic, see Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration .           Senior Colloquium     Students must successfully complete a two-hour presentation and discussion with the student\u2019s adviser and two other faculty members. Both the rationale and booklist serve as the main focus of the discussion in the colloquium.     Rationale and Booklist     Students are required to submit (1) a three-to five-page adviser-approved rationale about the topic or topics to be discussed in the colloquium and (2) a booklist consisting of 20-25 books representing several academic disciplines and historical periods related to the theme or themes described in the rationale. Both the rational and booklist require approval from the student's adviser and the Gallatin School.     For more information about this topic, see Colloquium .          Classroom Unit Requirement     Students must complete at least 64 units in classroom courses. Transfer credits and course equivalency generally count toward this 64-unit requirement, but independent study, tutorial, internship, and private lesson credits do not.           Residency Requirements     A minimum of 64 units of coursework must be completed after matriculation in Gallatin.   In addition, students are required to complete their last 32 units at NYU, through courses at NYU in New York City or at an NYU study away program. Students who wish to study abroad through a school other than NYU or who wish to take courses outside of NYU should either do so before they complete 96 units or file a petiion asking to be waived from the requirement. Such arrangements require prior permission, which may be requested by submitting an External Study application (and petition, if necessary) to the Gallatin Office of Global Programs , 411 Lafayette Street, 3rd Floor.              Limitations          Time Limit for Completion of the Bachelor's Degree   Undergraduate students must complete all degree requirements within a period of 10 years  from the first semester of matriculation at Gallatin.   For students who are readmitted, the original period of matriculation is counted toward  the 10-year limit; the hiatus is not counted, and the clock resumes upon readmission.        Transfer Credit Maximum   A student may apply a maximum of 64 transfer units toward his or her Gallatin degree. Included in this maximum are all units earned prior to admission to Gallatin (including Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, Maturity Exam Certificate, etc.), any non-NYU units a student may be approved to take after matriculation at Gallatin, as well as units granted for course equivalency. Please note: all Gallatin degree candidates must complete a minimum of 64 units after matriculation at Gallatin and must satisfy all other degree requirements.   For more information about transfer credit, please see Advanced Placement and other pre-college credit .        Course Equivalency Maximum Units   Undergraduate students may earn a maximum of 32 course equivalency credits for professional experiences they have had before matriculating in Gallatin. Course equivalency credits will be applied toward the transfer credit limit. The number of course equivalency and transfer credits combined may not exceed 64 units. Course equivalency credit does not count toward the undergraduate residency requirement   See Course Equivalency for more information about how to apply for this credit.        Business Courses Maximum Units   No more than 31 units in business courses can count towards the Gallatin BA degree. This includes business courses in the Stern School, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and those transferred from other colleges and universities.

EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

We will read and analyze classic and modern works in fields ranging from philosophy and religion to literature and visual art, representative literary and dramatic works as well as works of theory and historiography. Early weeks of the course will be organized around texts and images representative of the major historical periods used to organize Western humanities research\u2014the ancient world, the early modern period (\u201cRenaissance\u201d), and Enlightenment and Modernity. After that initial period, the syllabus will focus on major questions, themes, methods, and terms that recur frequently in contemporary humanities research: language, value and taste, form and content, interpretation and criticism, close reading, the uses of history, theorizing, cross-cultural influence and exchange, and the relationship between the disciplines of the humanities and those of the social sciences. In the last phase of the semester, we will apply everything discussed so far to a number of readings representative of the \u201cbig\u201d preoccupations of the moment. Students in the class will have a strong voice in determining what those issues are, but they might include the study of affect, cross-cultural exchange in the globalized present, the humanities in modern education and public policy, post-humanism, or the digital humanities. In addition to short response postings and a midterm paper, students will conduct a research / critical project on a relevant topic of their own choosing that will culminate in a 15 \u2013 20 page final paper. Guest lectures by Gallatin faculty will introduce students to a range of methodologies and interdisciplinary research frameworks.
