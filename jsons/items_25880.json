NYU Steinhardt offers a world-class facility for conducting research in mathematics education. Factors that distinguish our PhD program in Teaching and Learning are:       Faculty conduct research in settings from kindergarten to higher education as well as settings outside of school, and routinely participate in grants and partnerships with a variety of institutions.    Faculty use a wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods in research.    NYU Steinhardt is located in one of the most ethnically diverse, cosmopolitan, urban settings in the world.    NYU Steinhardt has established partnerships with 17 schools in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, providing doctoral candidates with a wide range of potential sites for research activities.    Doctoral study at NYU Steinhardt offers small classes and seminars and close interaction with research faculty.    Doctoral candidates, in their first year, have opportunities to meet and interact with all potential doctoral advisers through courses and research seminars.    Courses are designed to prepare candidates for all aspects of the research process, including development and design of research proposals, implementation of a research agenda, and dissemination of findings.       Students take a series of courses about mathematics education focused on issues of learning, teaching and teacher education, curriculum, technology as well as doing qualitative research in mathematics education. Coupled with this are general research methods courses on designing and analyzing qualitative and quantitative research studies. Finally, students take mathematics courses appropriate to the level of interest (elementary, secondary, post-secondary) in their research. For those interested in doing work at the secondary or above level, students must take mathematics courses in the mathematics department.    Those interested in mathematics education as a focus in our doctoral program will find exceptional resources among our faculty. Mathematics Education faculty work closely with College of Arts and Sciences faculty in the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. These collaborations provide doctoral candidates with opportunities to draw on content knowledge and pedagogical expertise from a diverse range of sources.    Our Mathematics Education faculty include:       Jasmine Ma    Martin Simon    Orit Zaslavksy       Learn more about the doctoral program in Teaching and Learning , including themes of study , degree requirements , and doctoral seminars .

NYU Steinhardt offers a world-class facility for conducting research in mathematics education. Factors that distinguish our PhD program in Teaching and Learning are:       Faculty conduct research in settings from kindergarten to higher education as well as settings outside of school, and routinely participate in grants and partnerships with a variety of institutions.    Faculty use a wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods in research.    NYU Steinhardt is located in one of the most ethnically diverse, cosmopolitan, urban settings in the world.    NYU Steinhardt has established partnerships with 17 schools in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, providing doctoral candidates with a wide range of potential sites for research activities.    Doctoral study at NYU Steinhardt offers small classes and seminars and close interaction with research faculty.    Doctoral candidates, in their first year, have opportunities to meet and interact with all potential doctoral advisers through courses and research seminars.    Courses are designed to prepare candidates for all aspects of the research process, including development and design of research proposals, implementation of a research agenda, and dissemination of findings.       Students take a series of courses about mathematics education focused on issues of learning, teaching and teacher education, curriculum, technology as well as doing qualitative research in mathematics education. Coupled with this are general research methods courses on designing and analyzing qualitative and quantitative research studies. Finally, students take mathematics courses appropriate to the level of interest (elementary, secondary, post-secondary) in their research. For those interested in doing work at the secondary or above level, students must take mathematics courses in the mathematics department.    Those interested in mathematics education as a focus in our doctoral program will find exceptional resources among our faculty. Mathematics Education faculty work closely with College of Arts and Sciences faculty in the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. These collaborations provide doctoral candidates with opportunities to draw on content knowledge and pedagogical expertise from a diverse range of sources.    Our Mathematics Education faculty include:       Jasmine Ma    Martin Simon    Orit Zaslavksy       Learn more about the doctoral program in Teaching and Learning , including themes of study , degree requirements , and doctoral seminars .
