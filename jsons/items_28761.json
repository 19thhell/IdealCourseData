Description       Memory is part of the human condition, and the way it works has long captivated us\u2014and continues to do so in the digital age. In this seminar we consider ways that new technologies change how we remember and by extension, how we forget. Do we remember more now because data can be so easily stored digitally? Or do we forget more because we too readily save information in a way that doesn\u2019t require us to meaningfully process it? What are the ramifications for how we understand history? This course engages critical debates surrounding personal memory as well as cultural memory, in particular with regard to museums, memorials, and archives\u2014all sites that have been, in ways, transformed by digital technology. Even Facebook is altering the way we store and remember aspects of our own lives. This seminar aims to bring crucial awareness to these many aspects through readings, discussion, and writing, culminating in a research paper. Assignments include reaction papers and class trips to memorial sites, and students are encouraged to develop a research topic of their interest. Our syllabus features cultural critics such as Benjamin, Huyssen, and Hirsch, in addition to scholars who focus on the Internet, digital archives, and social media.

They convened thought leaders from the higher education, business and venture capital sectors for a provocative conversation about the ongoing transformation of higher education, emerging business models, and broader societal implications. Stern&rsquo;s Center for Business Analytics and AIG sponsored the event. The speakers asserted provocations and gave arguments in a Ted-like talk style, each related to three large broad questions designed to spark conversation, debate and discussion.  NYU Stern&rsquo;s Adam Brandenburger, Vasant Dhar and Arun Sundararajan welcome the group.  John Sexton, President, NYU; Andre Dua, Director, McKinsey &amp; Company; Zach Sims, Co-founder, Codeacademy; Clayton Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School; and Vasant Dhar (moderator) debate what the future of higher education will look like. Will it be good for society?&rdquo;  Ashwinn Krishnaswamy (BS 2013), Founder, Point; Richard Matasar, VP for University Enterprise Initiatives, NYU; Brad Hargreaves, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer, General Assembly; Albert Wenger, Partner, Union Square Ventures; and Vasant Dhar (co-moderator) share viewpoints on whether universities provide good value for money today. What are the gaps in the higher education ecosystem, and who will fill them?  Clay Shirky, Professor, NYU ITP; Michael Karjanaprakorn, Founder and CEO, Skillshare; Michael Staton, Partner, Learn Capital; Lynne O&rsquo;Brien, Associate Vice Provost for Digital and Online Education Initiatives, Duke University; and Arun Sundararajan (moderator) predict what the business model of universities will look like in the future. Where in the value chain does incumbant and entrant advantage lie? Students Share their Perspectives on the Future of Higher Education.

Description       Memory is part of the human condition, and the way it works has long captivated us\u2014and continues to do so in the digital age. In this seminar we consider ways that new technologies change how we remember and by extension, how we forget. Do we remember more now because data can be so easily stored digitally? Or do we forget more because we too readily save information in a way that doesn\u2019t require us to meaningfully process it? What are the ramifications for how we understand history? This course engages critical debates surrounding personal memory as well as cultural memory, in particular with regard to museums, memorials, and archives\u2014all sites that have been, in ways, transformed by digital technology. Even Facebook is altering the way we store and remember aspects of our own lives. This seminar aims to bring crucial awareness to these many aspects through readings, discussion, and writing, culminating in a research paper. Assignments include reaction papers and class trips to memorial sites, and students are encouraged to develop a research topic of their interest. Our syllabus features cultural critics such as Benjamin, Huyssen, and Hirsch, in addition to scholars who focus on the Internet, digital archives, and social media.

They convened thought leaders from the higher education, business and venture capital sectors for a provocative conversation about the ongoing transformation of higher education, emerging business models, and broader societal implications. Stern&rsquo;s Center for Business Analytics and AIG sponsored the event. The speakers asserted provocations and gave arguments in a Ted-like talk style, each related to three large broad questions designed to spark conversation, debate and discussion.  NYU Stern&rsquo;s Adam Brandenburger, Vasant Dhar and Arun Sundararajan welcome the group.  John Sexton, President, NYU; Andre Dua, Director, McKinsey &amp; Company; Zach Sims, Co-founder, Codeacademy; Clayton Christensen, Professor, Harvard Business School; and Vasant Dhar (moderator) debate what the future of higher education will look like. Will it be good for society?&rdquo;  Ashwinn Krishnaswamy (BS 2013), Founder, Point; Richard Matasar, VP for University Enterprise Initiatives, NYU; Brad Hargreaves, Co-founder and Chief Product Officer, General Assembly; Albert Wenger, Partner, Union Square Ventures; and Vasant Dhar (co-moderator) share viewpoints on whether universities provide good value for money today. What are the gaps in the higher education ecosystem, and who will fill them?  Clay Shirky, Professor, NYU ITP; Michael Karjanaprakorn, Founder and CEO, Skillshare; Michael Staton, Partner, Learn Capital; Lynne O&rsquo;Brien, Associate Vice Provost for Digital and Online Education Initiatives, Duke University; and Arun Sundararajan (moderator) predict what the business model of universities will look like in the future.

Description       The main goal of this course is to provide students with ways how to enhance traditional storytelling by new technologies without diminishing the role of the written word. While authors and publishers are getting increasingly worried about the future of literature in the digital age, this course will offer constructive approach to the situation.We will examine every aspect of the craft of traditional fiction writing: plot, structure, point of view, narrative voice, dialogue, building of individual scenes, etc as well as the new techniques of the digital age: hypertext, moving text, self-editing text, visual and audio images, animation. We will learn how to balance the traditional with the new without overwhelming the written text with gadgets. The class will become a community of writers working in a safe, honest and considerate environment, presenting their own fiction, responding to the writing of others, and discussing questions about literature, editing, and publishing in the digital age. Each student will write two pieces of fiction using some of the ideas we will be discussing. (The pieces don\u2019t have to appear in the electronic form, but students must be able to explain how they would work.) Reading assignments will include works by a variety of classic and contemporary fiction writers, such as Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Mark Z. Danielewski, Andy Campbell, and Jonathan Safran Foer. Supplementary assignments will include books and articles on writing in the digital age, such as\u00a0 Rethinking Media and Change: Aesthetics of Transition \u00a0, eds. Thorburn and Jenkins,\u00a0 The New Media Reader \u00a0, eds. Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort.
