Formed in 1987, the Center has been a department of the  Faculty of Arts and Science since 1994.         The research interests of the faculty span a broad range of topics in  neural science, including mechanisms of perception, cognition, and action.  Techniques in use in our laboratories include molecular and  cell biology, neurophysiology and neuroanatomy, brain imaging, and human  and animal behavior. Empirical work at every level of investigation  benefits from fruitful interaction with a unique and distinguished group  of theorists both within the Center and in the Courant Institute of  Mathematical Sciences. The Center also benefits from the outstanding  academic environment at the Washington Square Campus, including major  research programs the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Economics,  Physics, and Psychology. Beyond Washington Square, the Center enjoys a  close cooperative relationship with the Neuroscience Institute and with  other researchers in the basic and clinical neurosciences at the NYU  School of Medicine.
