Psychology studies the mind and behavior. The major in Psychology introduces students to the main concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in the field. Students gain  the ability to think scientifically, creatively, and critically about human behavior and mental processes; to acquire the basic skills for conducting research in these areas; and to develop a general understanding of psychology as both a natural science and a social science. Students grapple with overarching themes and persistent questions in psychology, such as the interaction of heredity and  environment, variability and continuity of behavior and mental processes within and across species, free will versus determinism, the relation between mind and body, and applicability of general  theories and measures to specific societal and cultural contexts. Topics of inquiry include: cognition; sensation and perception; language and memory; child development; personality and individual  differences; social interaction and group dynamics; intergroup relations; and the connection between the individual and society.     Students emerge from the major with realistic ideas about how to implement their psychological knowledge, skills, and values in occupational pursuits in a variety of settings.

PSYCH-AD 100 Introduction to Linguistics                                             This course offers an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. It affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, which is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.

An understanding of how behavior is implemented in different organisms is critical for a full appreciation of the connection between mind and action. In this course, students discover connections between psychology and biology, pharmacology, endocrinology, and genetics. In particular, students explore the structure, function and development of the human nervous system and discuss how they give rise to basic sensory, motor, cognitive and motivational processes that characterize the human mind. Students develop a basic understanding of the methodologies used in biopsychology and important scientific findings in the field, allowing them to gain insights on how thoughts and behaviors can be rooted in physiological causes.

This course provides a better understanding of how we humans perceive and think about ourselves and about the world. This is relevant to psychology because our perception and thought processes are fraught with biases that nonetheless routinely inform human actions. Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision-making, while emphasizing how psychologists use experiments to learn about the structure of the human mind, including how the mind and human thinking works, with all its successes and pitfalls.

It focuses on developmental processes and milestones from infancy through adolescence. Lectures interweave theory, methods, and findings about how we develop as perceiving, thinking, and feeling beings. The course covers physical development, cognitive processes, social and emotional development, language development, family contexts, risk and resilience, and nature/nurture issues. The course will explore the origins and development of human knowledge in the individual child with a focus on two core domains: knowledge of the physical world and knowledge of the social world. Within each domain, the course focuses on experimental data from developmental psychology but also draws on evidence from other disciplines, including comparative psychology, behavioral ecology, and cultural anthropology.

Because humans are fundamentally social animals, understanding social psychology is important for understanding human psychology more generally. This course provides a comprehensive survey of research and theory in the psychology of social behaviors, emotions, motivations, and cognitions of individuals, including the study of perceiving others, attitude formation, decision making, group processes, altruism and helping, aggression, social influence, the self, attraction, affiliation, moral thought and action, and intergroup relations.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar so that students can begin the Capstone Project by the fall semester of their senior year.    Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

We will begin with Freud&rsquo;s discovery of the psychoanalytic method in Studies on Hysteria and Piaget&rsquo;s classical essay on methods in The Child&rsquo;s Conception of the World. We will then read contemporary reflections on the challenges of psychological inquiry, including what modes of listening create trust, how to address the complexity of people&rsquo;s inner lives, and the cultural context of research. Research begins with a question, and the students will be asked to pose a &ldquo;real question,&rdquo; meaning something they don&rsquo;t know but want to know, and to conduct an interview with someone who might help them to answer their question. The Listening Guide method will be taught to illustrate a way of listening for and analyzing the psychological logic of an interview transcript or text.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.

Psychology studies the mind and behavior. The major in Psychology introduces students to the main concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in the field. Students gain  the ability to think scientifically, creatively, and critically about human behavior and mental processes; to acquire the basic skills for conducting research in these areas; and to develop a general understanding of psychology as both a natural science and a social science. Students grapple with overarching themes and persistent questions in psychology, such as the interaction of heredity and  environment, variability and continuity of behavior and mental processes within and across species, free will versus determinism, the relation between mind and body, and applicability of general  theories and measures to specific societal and cultural contexts. Topics of inquiry include: cognition; sensation and perception; language and memory; child development; personality and individual  differences; social interaction and group dynamics; intergroup relations; and the connection between the individual and society.     Students emerge from the major with realistic ideas about how to implement their psychological knowledge, skills, and values in occupational pursuits in a variety of settings.

PSYCH-AD 100 Introduction to Linguistics                                             This course offers an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. It affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, which is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.

This course provides a better understanding of how we humans perceive and think about ourselves and about the world. This is relevant to psychology because our perception and thought processes are fraught with biases that nonetheless routinely inform human actions. Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision-making, while emphasizing how psychologists use experiments to learn about the structure of the human mind, including how the mind and human thinking works, with all its successes and pitfalls.

Because humans are fundamentally social animals, understanding social psychology is important for understanding human psychology more generally. This course provides a comprehensive survey of research and theory in the psychology of social behaviors, emotions, motivations, and cognitions of individuals, including the study of perceiving others, attitude formation, decision making, group processes, altruism and helping, aggression, social influence, the self, attraction, affiliation, moral thought and action, and intergroup relations.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar so that students can begin the Capstone Project by the fall semester of their senior year.

We will begin with Freud&rsquo;s discovery of the psychoanalytic method in Studies on Hysteria and Piaget&rsquo;s classical essay on methods in The Child&rsquo;s Conception of the World. We will then read contemporary reflections on the challenges of psychological inquiry, including what modes of listening create trust, how to address the complexity of people&rsquo;s inner lives, and the cultural context of research. Research begins with a question, and the students will be asked to pose a &ldquo;real question,&rdquo; meaning something they don&rsquo;t know but want to know, and to conduct an interview with someone who might help them to answer their question. The Listening Guide method will be taught to illustrate a way of listening for and analyzing the psychological logic of an interview transcript or text.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.

The major in Psychology introduces students to the main concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in the field. Students gain  the ability to think scientifically, creatively, and critically about human behavior and mental processes; to acquire the basic skills for conducting research in these areas; and to develop a general understanding of psychology as both a natural science and a social science. Students grapple with overarching themes and persistent questions in psychology, such as the interaction of heredity and  environment, variability and continuity of behavior and mental processes within and across species, free will versus determinism, the relation between mind and body, and applicability of general  theories and measures to specific societal and cultural contexts. Topics of inquiry include: cognition; sensation and perception; language and memory; child development; personality and individual  differences; social interaction and group dynamics; intergroup relations; and the connection between the individual and society.     Students emerge from the major with realistic ideas about how to implement their psychological knowledge, skills, and values in occupational pursuits in a variety of settings.

PSYCH-AD 100 Introduction to Linguistics                                             This course offers an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. It affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, which is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.

An understanding of how behavior is implemented in different organisms is critical for a full appreciation of the connection between mind and action. In this course, students discover connections between psychology and biology, pharmacology, endocrinology, and genetics. In particular, students explore the structure, function and development of the human nervous system and discuss how they give rise to basic sensory, motor, cognitive and motivational processes that characterize the human mind. Students develop a basic understanding of the methodologies used in biopsychology and important scientific findings in the field, allowing them to gain insights on how thoughts and behaviors can be rooted in physiological causes.

This course provides a better understanding of how we humans perceive and think about ourselves and about the world. This is relevant to psychology because our perception and thought processes are fraught with biases that nonetheless routinely inform human actions. Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision-making, while emphasizing how psychologists use experiments to learn about the structure of the human mind, including how the mind and human thinking works, with all its successes and pitfalls.

It focuses on developmental processes and milestones from infancy through adolescence. Lectures interweave theory, methods, and findings about how we develop as perceiving, thinking, and feeling beings. The course covers physical development, cognitive processes, social and emotional development, language development, family contexts, risk and resilience, and nature/nurture issues. The course will explore the origins and development of human knowledge in the individual child with a focus on two core domains: knowledge of the physical world and knowledge of the social world. Within each domain, the course focuses on experimental data from developmental psychology but also draws on evidence from other disciplines, including comparative psychology, behavioral ecology, and cultural anthropology.

Because humans are fundamentally social animals, understanding social psychology is important for understanding human psychology more generally. This course provides a comprehensive survey of research and theory in the psychology of social behaviors, emotions, motivations, and cognitions of individuals, including the study of perceiving others, attitude formation, decision making, group processes, altruism and helping, aggression, social influence, the self, attraction, affiliation, moral thought and action, and intergroup relations.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar so that students can begin the Capstone Project by the fall semester of their senior year.    Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

We will begin with Freud&rsquo;s discovery of the psychoanalytic method in Studies on Hysteria and Piaget&rsquo;s classical essay on methods in The Child&rsquo;s Conception of the World. We will then read contemporary reflections on the challenges of psychological inquiry, including what modes of listening create trust, how to address the complexity of people&rsquo;s inner lives, and the cultural context of research. Research begins with a question, and the students will be asked to pose a &ldquo;real question,&rdquo; meaning something they don&rsquo;t know but want to know, and to conduct an interview with someone who might help them to answer their question. The Listening Guide method will be taught to illustrate a way of listening for and analyzing the psychological logic of an interview transcript or text.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.
