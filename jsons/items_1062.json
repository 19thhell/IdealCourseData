Where activities sponsored by student organizations constitute violations of University rules or of public laws and regulations, sanctions may be imposed on such organizations as well as on individual students.

Students are advised to familiarize themselves with the applicable behavioral policies and procedures set forth by the NYU School in which they are enrolled.

IV. RESIDENCE LIFE POLICIES:            Under the oversight and guidance of the Office of Community Standards, Residential Life staff members address violations of residential life policies.

OFFICE/DEPARTMENTAL POLICIES:       Such policies may be based upon formal agreements with students and/or requirements that are imposed by external agencies associated with the student's utilization of that particular office or service. Examples of offices or departments which have such policies and procedures include the Financial Aid Office, Coles Sports Center, Bobst Library, and the Center for Students with Disabilities.                                                                                                            VI. GLOBAL ACADEMIC CENTER POLICIES:             Statement of General Principals:       By enrolling in an Academic Center Abroad, a student assumes not only the rights and privileges of membership in a unique community but also the duties of citizenry associated with maintaining the values of the University community as well as those of the country in which the campus is located. Each student is expected to conduct his/her academic and non-academic life in a manner that demonstrates consideration for the rights, property, and interests of New York University, concern for the well-being of other community members, and respect for the culture, customs and laws of the nation in which the student is a guest.         On behalf of, and in conjunction with, its members, the University has a duty to address behavior that jeopardizes the health, safety, or welfare of its members; compromises the academic or intellectual process; disrupts the administrative and supporting services of the University; and/or shows a disrespect for the country and local community in which the Academic Center is located. Students who are alleged to have engaged in behavior that violates the Study Away Standar d, New York University policies, and/or Center-specific policies will be subject to review through the University student conduct process at the Center and/or the University level as deemed appropriate. The University also reserves the right to report matters involving criminal acts to the proper authorities. In disciplinary matters involving a visiting student whose home institution is other than New York University, NYU reserves the right to inform the appropriate office at that institution of the matter and results of all disciplinary decisions involving that student.                                                                                            General Principles and Standards of Student Conduct                                Academic communities exist to facilitate the process of acquiring and exchanging knowledge and understanding, to enhance the personal and intellectual development of its members, and to advance the interests of society. In order to realize its purpose, the University and its members must be free from personal injury or harm; bias or harassment; intimidation or coercion; damage or loss of property; disruption of educational and social activities; unreasonable interference with the exchange of concepts and ideas; and unreasonable interference with the administrative and supporting services offered by the University. Accordingly, all student members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that demonstrates mutual respect for the rights and personal/academic well-being of others, preserves the integrity of the social and academic environment, and supports the mission of the University. The University has an inherent right to address behavior that impedes, obstructs, or threatens the maintenance of order and attainment of the aforementioned goals by violating the standards of conduct set forth in the University student conduct policies noted below as well as other policies that may established by the respective Schools, Global Sites, and administrative offices of the University.

Partnered with Verizon and Break The Cycle, an organization dedicated to empowering youth to end domestic violence, BGC hosted the first in series of app-building competitions meant to expose African-American girls to the world of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)&mdash;a community in which they are vastly underrepresented. The competition, themed around educating young people on what makes for healthy and unhealthy relationship, performed double duty in introducing the girls to a new potential career field and giving them the opportunity to educate themselves and others on an issue also affecting their peers.   &ldquo;With this program,&rdquo; said Donna Knutt, a BGC volunteer, &ldquo;[the girls] are helping themselves to help others. And there are no barriers. It&rsquo;s come as you are.&rdquo;   For this competition, there were 17 teams composed of three to four girls, ranging in ages from 10 to 17, most with little to no exposure to software development. Each team has access to adult facilitators/mentors with various backgrounds.   Day One of the hackathon comprised of the brainstorming, or ideation, phase. Day Two was devoted to building the actual app and preparing for a group presentation the teams would pitch before their peers, parents and supporters, and a panel of judges.   Quiessence Philips, a BGC volunteer with a background in cyber security, observed that although the stages of software development were new concepts for most of the girls, it wasn&rsquo;t their biggest obstacle.   &ldquo;The most challenging thing for the girls,&rdquo; Philips said, &ldquo;was that learning curve of working within a group.   Back in Rogers Hall, the weekend&rsquo;s design headquarters, a member of Team NKJT, a group of bright-eyed, grinning 10 year olds, confirmed Philips&rsquo; observation.   &ldquo;The hardest thing was coming to a conclusion because we all wanted to add pieces to the game. That was the hardest part. Trying to take a piece of everybody&rsquo;s idea and merge everything together.&rdquo;   Team NKJT settled on an app modeled after the popular game &ldquo;Subway Surfer&rdquo; but incorporated a quiz element used to evaluate how people are doing in various relationships and suggested ways to make improvements on them.   Each of the four classrooms-turned-design-hubs housed teams intensely planning, designing and preparing for upcoming practice presentations and, ultimately, the main (pitching) event. Some participants even skipped socializing during lunch and worked between bites of food from paper plates positioned beside whirring laptops.   In each room, minds were churning, thoughts were being exchanged, ideas were becoming reality and, in keeping with the theme of the hackathon, it just so happened that the tenets of positive relationship building were being put into practice.   Amidst a backdrop of rainbow-scribble whiteboards and walls papered with post-its, the girls of Team Love 4 Life prepped and encouraged one another for their upcoming pitch and fine-tuned a slide show, as their mentor Wayne Warner, an African-American front-end developer and first-time BGC volunteer, looked on.   &ldquo;They definitely gained experience thinking through a project, brainstorming, getting ideas on paper, all the way down to something they can build,&rdquo; said Warner who went on to say why he wanted to take part in the event.   &ldquo;[The lack of diversity] is a problem in the industry. I walk around I see it every day. Nobody else looks like me. And nobody looks like anyone in this room, more specifically,&rdquo; Warner said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to be a part of the solution.&rdquo;   And those presentations the girls were hard at work preparing?   &ldquo;The event was very inspiring. The girls were very engaged,&rdquo; said DeAngela Duff, Co-Director of Integrated Digital Media at the NYU School of Engineering. &ldquo;During their demos, the level of poise, confidence, and knowledge the girls exhibited rivaled many adult presentations.&rdquo;   Judging by the energy of all the participants, volunteers and organizers of the BGC &ldquo;Love is Respect&rdquo; Hackathon, the future of African-American women in STEM looks pretty promising.   Go girls.
