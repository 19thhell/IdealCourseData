America Reads, a national campaign that was initiated in 1997, challenges every American to help our children learn to read well and independently.    Building on the success of the America Reads Challenge, America Counts was initiated in July 1999 as an effort to improve student achievement in mathematic and assist students in mastering challenging mathematics, including the foundations of algebra and geometry, by the end of the 9th grade.    NYU's America Reads program began in 1997 with the placement of approximately 600 tutors in 43 schools in New York City School Districts 1 and 2. Today NYU America Reads has grown to include mathematics tutoring, expanding the program to NYU America Reads and Counts.    Currently, we place approximately 1000 tutors in 100 schools in New York City School Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,13 and 23. These dedicated NYU undergraduate and graduate students provide close to 10,000 hours per week of academic assistance to students in grades Pre-K - 8, at no cost to the participating schools.

Nationwide, there are approximately 1200 colleges and universities participating in the America Reads Challenge.   Building on the success of the America Reads Challenge, America Counts was initiated in July 1999 as an effort to improve student achievement in mathematic and assist students in mastering challenging mathematics, including the foundations of algebra and geometry, by the end of the 9th grade. Nationwide, there are approximately 300 colleges and universities participating in America Counts.     NYU's America Reads program began in 1997 with the placement of approximately 700 tutors in 43 schools in New York City School Districts 1 and 2. Today, as schools prepare students for careers of the 21st century, NYU America Reads has grown to include mathematics tutoring, expanding the program to NYU America Reads &amp; America Counts.     Currently, approximately 800 tutors are placed in 80 schools in New York City School Districts 1, 2, 4, and 13. These dedicated NYU undergraduate and graduate students provide approximately 10,000 hours per week of academic assistance to students in grades Pre-K \u2013 9, at no cost to the participating schools.

Sign up for the Waitlist    On-Campus Employee Application             This information is designed to help you understand how the program works, what your commitment would be, etc. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY!!! Doing so will help you decide if this program is right for you. You will, of course, get additional orientation about the program before you start to work. But the more you know about the program beforehand, they better your chance of qualifying for one of these jobs.    Details of NYU's America Reads and Counts Program       All AR/AC tutoring is done in New York City public school classrooms during the school day (roughly 8:30 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.) and the school week Monday - Friday. There is some work in afterschool programs (3:00 - 5:00 pm), but there is no work on weekends or evenings.    The schools are all in Manhattan Brooklyn, and the Bronx. Most schools are close to the NYU campus. You can see where all the schools are by going to our website, but you may not request a specific school. You must go where you are assigned. You will be assigned to a Manhattan school unless you specifically request a different borough.    We will give you Orientation before you are sent to a school.    When we send you to a school the school principal will assign you to a classroom teacher (or teachers) to work with.    Working with your classroom teacher, you can make your own schedule to accommodate your NYU class schedule. That is, you can work at any times that suit you and your teacher, within these parameters: a). You must work a minimum of 6 hours a week, during the school day (8:30 - 3:00). We do not know what schools have after-school programs, and we will not take into consideration afterschool hours when hiring you. b) You must work on at least 2 days of the week c) You must work in blocks of no less than 2 hours. d) No work on Fridays may begin after 12:00 noon, although you may continue working on Friday afternoon if you begin before noon. There is no daily maximum. You can work as many hours in a day as you have available and your teacher/school will agree. There is a weekly maximum of twenty hours. d) Once you agree on a schedule, we expect you to keep that schedule, but we understand if tutors must at times miss work due to illness, academic work, etc.    Your work will always be done in the presence of, and under the direction and supervision of, a classroom teacher or other school employee. Your work will vary--you may, at times, work one-on-one with a student; you may work with small groups; you may work with large groups. Your work will be academic in nature. Although you may be asked to perform occasional clerical or housekeeping tasks (making copies, straightening the room, etc.) the great majority of your time will be helping students with their academic needs. If a teacher is asking you to do things that are not academic in nature, we will assist you in correcting that situation.    You are allowed to take NYU holidays, or to take time off around exam time, or if you're sick, have a big test coming up, etc. However, we expect you to inform your teacher beforehand about your expected absence.    You are paid for the time you do work with children, either in the classroom, in the lunchroom or on the playground, or the time you spend with your teacher or other teachers in your school receiving training, planning lessons, etc. The teacher will supervise your work, tell you what to do, which students to work with, etc. You will do a variety of things: work one-on-one with children; work with small and large groups, etc. You do not need any specialized training.    You are not paid for travel time (and you need to count on a half-hour each way) and are not paid for lunch or break time that is not spent with teachers or students.    Many schools have after-school programs from 3 - 5, although not every school has them every day. Any day you are working in the school at 3 o'clock, and the school has an afterschool program, you can continue to work in it. However, to qualify for this privilege, you must have 6 hours a week during the regular school day in your schedule. You may not complete your 6 hour schedule by adding 3-5 work blocks on days you are not otherwise in the school at 3.    You will be paid $11 per hour (undergraduates) and $13 per hour (graduate students) for work in Manhattan schools below 100th Street; $13 per hour (undergraduates) and $15 per hour (graduate students) for work in Brooklyn schools, in Manhattan above 100th Street, or the Bronx. You will be paid every 2 weeks based on a timesheet you submit that is verified by your cooperating teacher.    If you are a graduate student, you may be asked to send us some brief observations about how things are going in your school. And there may be an optional meeting or two for you to attend. If we want you to submit observations or attend a meeting, we will let you know.    Your pay is your own; it is not applied to your tuition, etc. You get money to do with what you choose. It is taxable; how much tax is withheld is a completely individual calculation, based on number of dependents, etc. Social Security is not withheld (except during the summer if you're not enrolled at NYU.)    You can begin work shortly after you are oriented, and must begin work withing two weeks of your Orientation. You can work until you exhaust your federal work study allowance. The average annual FWS allowance at NYU is $3500; this would allow you to work roughly 10 hours a week at $11 per hour for 34 weeks. For most people, this means you will have the job for the entire year. However, if you work more (as many graduate students do) you could earn the full amount sooner; if you work less, you may not earn all of your FWS. When America Reads tutors exhaust their FWS allotment, the Office of Financial Aid will often, but not always, grant more aid. This is a request you must make directly.    You will stay at the same school for both semesters (or until you run out of money.) You can request a different school in subsequent years (but few tutors do so.) You can work in this program as long as you are an NYU student with a federal work-study allotment and your work is satisfactory.       In short, we give you maximum flexibility in making this job fit with your schedule. But once you make the schedule, we expect you to keep it.    What does this mean for now?       Make sure you have a Federal Work Study allotment. You can check this with the Office of Financial Aid .    Look at your schedule and see if you have time to participate in the program. There is a work schedule on the website that you can look at to see how scheduling is done. Remember to leave 30 minutes on each side for travel. So if you have a class that ends at 10 and another that begins at 12, don't plan to work for America Reads and Counts from 10 - 12 on that day; in reality, you can only plan on 10:30 - 11:30, so that would not be a permissible 2 hour block.
