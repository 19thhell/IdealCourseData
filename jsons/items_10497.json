The highlight of the group is a trip we take every year, subsidized significantly, to an Asian city, to explore legal careers in Asia first-hand. We also communicate details of relevant events related to Asia and law that are happening at NYU or elsewhere in the city.   If you would like to participate in any of these events, then you are welcome to join our listserv.
