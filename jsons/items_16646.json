To advance   knowledge, we draw on a wide range of approaches \u2013 basic and applied,   theoretical and empirical, deductive and inductive, micro and macro,   quantitative and qualitative \u2013 striving to continuously break new   ground. Our PhD , MA-AQR , and undergraduate    programs prepare students for many callings, from research and teaching   to health, law, and public service, providing intellectual support and   inspiring them to innovate.
