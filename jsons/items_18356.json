            Engineering at NYU Abu Dhabi is designed to create technological leaders with a global perspective, a broad education, and the capacity to think creatively and innovate. The uniqueness of the program lies in the integration of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship (i 2 e) into all phases of study. Through i 2 e, students enjoy a learning environment conducive to creativity, which is essential to leadership in tomorrow's technological innovation and enterprises.   Students are involved in the progression of technological innovations and inventions from concept through product development and market introduction. Students gain a firm grounding across various science and engineering fields that underscore the technical component of an engineering education, but they also draw upon courses across the curriculum and work in multidisciplinary teams that incorporate cultural, political, economic, environmental, and public safety considerations. By incorporating best-practice management concepts and critical thinking from liberal arts, the Engineering program develops innovators and out-of-the-box thinkers for today's technology-infused, globally connected society.   A distinguished and diverse faculty engages in state-of-the-art research, innovation, invention, and entrepreneurship. Areas of emphasis at NYUAD are: new and existing energy resources, growth and sustainability of cities, information technology, Internet security, gaming, and bioengineering. Faculty at NYUAD actively collaborate with faculty in other divisions at NYUAD and NYUNY as well as faculty in the departments of civil, chemical and biological, computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU . Students in the Engineering program have the opportunity to participate in incubator activities, gaining hands-on experience working side by side with faculty and companies in i 2 e initiatives.   The Engineering major is built on the solid foundation of the basic elements of liberal arts and the Foundations of Science program, which is required for all science, math, and engineering majors. Engineering majors take Foundations of Science 1-4, beginning in their first year.   Students are exposed to a series of five engineering foundation courses, providing background in concepts relating to i 2 e, engineering analysis and design, computation and simulation, experimentation and instrumentation. Engineering Foundations must be completed before registering for upper-level engineering electives. The foundation courses explore fundamental engineering topics of mechanics, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, materials science, and electronic circuits. Students majoring in Engineering receive a broad and in-depth education while acquiring knowledge of transdisciplinary technological fields covering civil, chemical, biological, computer, electrical, or mechanical engineering.     The Engineering program provides sound preparation for careers in research, academia, industry, or government. It gives students a &quot;license to learn,&quot; preparing them to work in frontier areas of a multicultural world, equipped to learn quickly in specialized areas that will evolve with ever-increasing swiftness in the future. Graduates majoring in Engineering receive a Bachelor of Science degree.   Outstanding and highly motivated students may participate in special opportunities for independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in faculty laboratories. Interested students should discuss these options with their faculty mentor and seek approval from the Dean of Engineering.   Students declaring a major in Engineering are assigned a faculty mentor from the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study, determine course selections, and discuss career goals.

This course introduces students to the foundations of computer science. Students learn how to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs using a high-level programming language. The course covers core programming concepts including basic computation; data structures; control structure; iterative structures; file input/output and exception handling; recursion, sorting, searching, and functions. Students also learn the elements of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), such as objects, classes, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and interface. OOP is a programming paradigm used to solve complex systems. Students produce programs focusing on scientific concepts, graphics, games, and web common gateway interface (CGI) implementation. Students design, test, and develop innovative software applications such as games, interactive websites, and other projects related to different fields. In a final project, they develop a fully functioning, interactive, fun game that employs a clean design, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), simple to moderate strategy, and event-handling techniques.

This course aims to introduce the students to these laws namely&mdash;the conservation of mass, conservation of force and linear momentum, conservation of torque and angular momentum, conservation of energy, conservation of chemical species, and conservation of charge&mdash;that are derived in integral forms. Selected case studies are used to demonstrate the application of these laws for the simplification of complex engineering problems. In addition, this course also helps the students develop a deeper understanding of the concepts of work and heat.

Students are first introduced to the historical significance of experimental discoveries, the importance of experimental design and measurement. Key examples are discussed. The importance of measurements, errors, uncertainty and its justification will be discussed in detail and students will learn how to estimate, use and report uncertainties. Techniques to compare, analyze and report different measurements are studied. Students are introduced to error propagation rules, random and systematic errors and standard deviation as the uncertainty in a single measurement.

Its structure includes a process of design with measurable metrics, and incorporation of appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Emphasis is placed on clearly framing the design problem and following the design process to result in an optimized design solution. Students are encouraged to build prototypes of their designs and seek validation of their solutions through simulations and experiments, as appropriate.    The Capstone Project aims to be collaborative and trans-disciplinary across several engineering streams. The emphasis is on students applying the design process to solve real-world problems in a 21st century, global context. The projects address engineering and technology topics that overlap with the sciences, social sciences, liberal arts or business. The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester. The senior year culminates in a comprehensive project report and design review by a committee of faculty and other professionals.    Capstone Seminar (ENGR-AD-400), Capstone Design Project I (ENGR-AD-401) and Capstone Design Project II (ENGR-AD-402) collectively offer the engineering capstone experience to seniors. Capstone Seminar (Fall) and Capstone Design Project I (Fall) are two credits each. Capstone seminar focuses on skill building, project management and Ethics. Capstone Design Project I focus on different aspects of the capstone project such as problem definition and creating the design solution. Capstone Design Project II in spring consists of two, seven week modules. The design solution proposed in Capstone Design Project I is implemented in the first module.

Its structure includes a process of design with measurable metrics, and incorporation of appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Emphasis is placed on clearly framing the design problem and following the design process to result in an optimized design solution. Students are encouraged to build prototypes of their designs and seek validation of their solutions through simulations and experiments, as appropriate.    The Capstone Project aims to be collaborative and trans-disciplinary across several engineering streams. The emphasis is on students applying the design process to solve real-world problems in a 21st century, global context. The projects address engineering and technology topics that overlap with the sciences, social sciences, liberal arts or business. The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester. The senior year culminates in a comprehensive project report and design review by a committee of faculty and other professionals.    Capstone Seminar (ENGR-AD-400), Capstone Design Project I (ENGR-AD-401) and Capstone Design Project II (ENGR-AD-402) collectively offer the engineering capstone experience to seniors. Capstone Seminar (Fall) and Capstone Design Project I (Fall) are two credits each. Capstone seminar focuses on skill building, project management and Ethics. Capstone Design Project I focus on different aspects of the capstone project such as problem definition and creating the design solution. Capstone Design Project II in spring consists of two, seven week modules. The design solution proposed in Capstone Design Project I is implemented in the first module. It is tested and validated in Module II.    Prerequisite is Senior Standing    (2 credits Fall semester)    *Students must take ENGR-AD 400 and 401 concurrently.

Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.
