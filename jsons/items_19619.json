Final Project                  Wednesday, December 19   Final project implementation and documentation due at midnight    Thursday, December 20   Final project presentation, 12-3pm                Class Times    Lectures take place in the Education building (35 W. 4th St), 6th Floor Conference Room,  on Tuesday and Thursday 1-2:15 and the lab portion of the class meets Monday 1-2:15.      Problem Sets     Seven problem sets will be distributed during the semester. Each will be due via  electronic submission on Blackboard. You have seven \"late days\" that you may use  during the semester, each of which provides you with an extension of 24 hours. The  extensions can be distributed in any way you like--e.g. you can use all seven days  on one problem set or one day on each problem set, etc. No reason needs to be  given; whether you are ill, too busy with other things, or just don't feel like turning it in, it doesn't matter--how you use them is up to you. Lateness of electronic  submissions will be determined down to the minute by the submission timestamps  on Blackboard. If the problem set is due at 2pm and you submit it at 2:01pm, you  will lose a late day. If you've run out of late days, your assignment will be accepted  with a 25&#37; grade reduction per day late except in the case of an emergency.  \"Technical difficulties\" do not constitute emergencies. Also note that some of the  problem sets have mutliple parts that are due on different dates. Each day an individual part is late counts as a late day.  You may not use any late days on the course's final project. When computing your  final grade, your lowest score on these problem sets will be dropped and your six  highest scores will be weighted equally.     Quizzes     The course will have three hour-long quizzes. These quizzes will be \"closed-book.\"  However, you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (8.5\" x 11\") of notes,  typed or written, and a pen or pencil, but nothing else. You should expect the second  and third quizzes to be cumulative, but their content will be based mostly on lectures  subsequent to those covered by the first and second quizzes, respectively. When  computing your final grade, your lowest score on these quizzes will be dropped and your two highest scores will be weighted equally.      Final Project     The final project will be your opportunity to put your programming skills to use and  implement your own software application. As long as your project is written (mostly)  in C, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the instructor's  approval. You are welcome to utilize external libraries and hardware provided that the instructor  has access to all of these things and you are able to present it in class at the end of the semester.   Students in the music technology program are encouraged to choose a project topics such as  writing MAX/MSP externals, developing plug-ins, or using audio/MIDI APIs.    You may work together with up to two other students, however work is expected to  be distributed equally among project partners and the project itself must be  commensurate in scope. Each student is expected to contribute approximately 2000  lines of code to a project, whether working alone or with a group. If multiple  students are working on a project, the code must be thoroughly documented to  indicate which student wrote or contributed to each part.    Extensions on the final project will not be granted, except in cases of emergency.  Work submitted late without extension will be penalized as follows: projects  submitted up to one hour late will incur a penalty of 5&#37;; projects submitted up to  two hours late will incur a penalty of 10&#37;; projects submitted up to three hours late  will incur a penalty of 25&#37;; projects submitted up to four hours late will incur a  penalty of 50&#37;; projects submitted more than four hours late will incur a penalty of  100&#37;. Lateness of submissions will be determined down to the minute by  timestamps.      Final Exam     This course does not have a final exam.      Books                Required text       Programming in C , Third Edition by Stephen Kochan     Optional text for students less comfortable with programming       Absolute Beginner's Guide to C , Second Edition by Greg Perry      Optional recommended audio programming text:       The Audio Programming Book , R. Boulanger and V. Lazzarini (Eds.)            Grades     Final grades for the lecture class will be determined using the following weights:        Problem Sets (best 6 out of 7): 65&#37;      Quizzes (best 2 out of 3): 20&#37;      Final Project: 15&#37;          Final grades for the lab will be determined using the following weights:        Problem Sets (best 6 out of 7): 70&#37;      Attendance: 30&#37;             Platforms     Assignments are designed to be implemented on a UNIX-based system such as Mac OS X or Linux,  however it possible to use Windows. In the case of Windows, UNIX tools such as the  Cygwin library would have to be installed.      Academic Honesty     All work you do for the class is expected to be your own. Collaborating with others  unless explicitly allowed as well as copying material in any form from an individual,  book, website, or any other source is strictly prohibited, as is allowing another  student to copy or use your own work in any way. You are welcome to discuss the  course's material with others in order to better understand it. You may even discuss  problem sets with classmates, but you may not share or write code together.  The only possible exceptions to this is the final project, if you are working together with other students or utilizing an outside library or API. If you have any questions  about what kinds of communication/sharing/recycling of code are acceptable, contact the  instructor.           Acknowledgements     This class owes much of its structure and content to Harvard's  Computer Science 50, a course that the instructor took as an undergraduate  (many) years ago.
