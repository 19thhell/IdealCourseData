Cuomo Prerequisite: Photography II, or permission of the department.  Computer skills such as Photoshop and Indesign are recommended, but not  required. This course will explore Fashion Magazines as a theatre for the imagination. We will consider in-depth the work of such legendary art directors as Alexy Brodovitch and Marvin Israel, and their collaboration with prominent photographers including Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Hiro and William Klein. Through magazine spreads from Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Vogue, Ego\u00efste, and Portfolio Magazine along with film screenings of Funny Face , Qui \u00eates-vous Polly Maggoo? Blow up and Who is Marvin Israel?, we will consider the fashion magazine\u2019s historical context, contemporary relevance and its role as a force for social change. Field trips will include a visit to The Richard Avedon Foundation and a contemporary fashion magazine. During the course of the semester, students will make a fashion magazine. The magazine development process will include brainstorming, concept development, maquette sketches, photography, photo editing, writing, layout design and type design. The finished product will be a 64-page publication. Students will work collaboratively in small groups. This course requires a lab fee.
