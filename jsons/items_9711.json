Students     will learn to establish cognate sets to support hypotheses concerning     the genealogical classification and subgrouping of languages.

Data will be drawn from English and numerous other languages.     Syllabus          Definitions of etymology. Sources of cognates. Criteria for inherited      cognates.      Criterial for borrowed cognates. The comparative method: genealogical      classification of languages.      The comparative method: linguistic subgrouping. Basic core vocabulary.      Patterns of regular sound change: one-to-one, merger, split, emergence,      and obsolescence.      Sporadic sound changes.      Metaphor; semantic shifts.      Computer-assisted cognate identification: potentials and limitations.      Word formation: derivation (affixes, i/y-mutation, etc.) and compounding.      The Indo-European family of languages. Non-Indo-European sources      of English vocabulary.      The sounds of Proto-Indo-European and their development in the descendant      languages.      Ablaut (vowel gradation) in Proto-Indo-European and English. Etymological      support for the laryngeal hypotheses.      Grimm's Law (the first and second sound shifts in Germanic).

But a \"habit\" is also the garb or dress worn by nuns. What's the connection?        \"Habit\" in the first sense is really a shortened from a phrase that comes from Latin and survives in \"modern Latin,\" i.e., Italian.      In Italian, abito (the \"h\" is dropped, but the accent is still on the first syllable) means \"dress,\" and the phrase abito mentale (\"mental dress\") is the full phrase that reflects the meaning that the word \"habit\" by itself is usually given in English. But of course if the word abito were used in the right context, it would be understood to mean abito mentale ...      ...which leads to an Italian word I coined some years ago by adding two common suffixes to the root. It is abitinaccio , meaning \"nasty little habit.\""}]}]
