Description       In this course students will explore historical memory, mythmaking, and the myriad ways in which human beings construct and reconstruct the past to address present hopes, dreams, and fears. Our case study will be the Frankish Emperor Charlemagne (d. 814), who in life helped to lay the foundations of modern European society, and in death would continue to represent an imagined pan-European unity that predated factionalism, regionalism, and nationalism. The seminar will begin in the ninth century with Charlemagne in memory before moving briskly forward in time to study Charlemagne in legend and myth. Along the way, we will discuss themes and problems of particular relevance, including the birth of \u201cEurope,\u201d the advent of \u201cthe state,\u201d Christianity and Crusade, the rise of vernacular literature, and early colonialism. In addition to theoretical works on memory, myth, and history-writing, texts for discussion will include a vibrant mix of canonical and lesser-known gems: Einhard\u2019s\u00a0 Life of Charlemagne, \u00a0\u00a0 The Song of Roland \u00a0, and Ariosto\u2019s\u00a0 Orlando Furioso \u00a0; but also the Astronomer\u2019s\u00a0 Life of Louis the Pious \u00a0,\u00a0 The Voyage of Charlemagne to Jerusalem and Constantinople \u00a0, and the anonymous\u00a0 Charlemagne \u00a0play from the London of Shakespeare and Marlowe.

While he is particularly interested in the transformations of European culture and society during the Carolingian late-eighth, ninth, and early-tenth centuries, he has taught and written on such wide-ranging subjects as the history of emotion, masculinity, the history of kindness and philanthropy, travel, medieval Latin and vernacular comparative literature, spirituality, historical and literary theory, and the visual arts. Professor Romig is currently at work on a translation of an important early medieval treatise on representational art (&quot;King Charles's Book Against the Synod&quot;), along with a companion volume for the teaching and research of this text, both for the University of Toronto Press. He is also working on a book manuscript, tentatively entitled \u201cManliness and Empathy in the Carolingian World,\u201d which explores connections between caritas discourses and masculine ideologies during the long ninth century.                News       Professor Andrew Romig presented \u201cRidiculing the Emperor: Petrarch and the Legend of Fastrada\u2019s Ring,\u201d Twentieth International Medieval Congress, held in Leeds, England, in July 2013. In February 2014, he gave his paper \u201cPrison and Predestination: The \u2018Jailhouse\u2019 Correspondence of Gottschalk of Orbais,\u201d at the Prisons of Stone, Word, and Flesh: Medieval and Early Modern Captivity Conference, held at Brown University, in Providence, RI. He presented \u201cEnacting Empathy after the Carolingian Civil War,\u201d at The Fortieth Sewanee Medieval Colloquium: Medieval Emotions, in April 2014, at Sewanee: The University of the South, Sewanee, TN. He published \u201cIn Praise of the Too-Clement Emperor: The Problem of Forgiveness in the Astronomer\u2019s Vita Hludowici imperatoris\u201d in Speculum: A Journal of Medieval Studies 89.2 (Medieval Academy of America, Spring 2014).

Description       In this course students will explore historical memory, mythmaking, and the myriad ways in which human beings construct and reconstruct the past to address present hopes, dreams, and fears. Our case study will be the Frankish Emperor Charlemagne (d. 814), who in life helped to lay the foundations of modern European society, and in death would continue to represent an imagined pan-European unity that predated factionalism, regionalism, and nationalism. The seminar will begin in the ninth century with Charlemagne in memory before moving briskly forward in time to study Charlemagne in legend and myth. Along the way, we will discuss themes and problems of particular relevance, including the birth of \u201cEurope,\u201d the advent of \u201cthe state,\u201d Christianity and Crusade, the rise of vernacular literature, and early colonialism. In addition to theoretical works on memory, myth, and history-writing, texts for discussion will include a vibrant mix of canonical and lesser-known gems: Einhard\u2019s\u00a0 Life of Charlemagne, \u00a0\u00a0 The Song of Roland \u00a0, and Ariosto\u2019s\u00a0 Orlando Furioso \u00a0; but also the Astronomer\u2019s\u00a0 Life of Louis the Pious \u00a0,\u00a0 The Voyage of Charlemagne to Jerusalem and Constantinople \u00a0, and the anonymous\u00a0 Charlemagne \u00a0play from the London of Shakespeare and Marlowe.

It seeks to clarify the distinct features of art objects produced in the Greco-Roman World and in Early China through contrast and comparison. Mediums to be studied range from sculpture, pictorial arts to decorative arts. Topics to be discussed include heroes, deities, mythology, auspiciousness, femininity, and monumentality.       The seminar encourages students to establish direct connections with objects. All classes meet in the galleries or storerooms of the Museum.                    Seminar in Fall, 2012    Art &amp; Archaeology of Early Medieval China    The seminar surveys diverse visual and material cultures from the 3rd to the 6th centuries in China, a historical period marked by political division and ethnic integration. We will examine both transmitted and excavated objects, with special attention to their historical and archaeological contexts. Issues to discuss include ideology, identity, gender, and cultural interaction. Mediums to explore range from calligraphy, painting, architecture, sculpture, to ceramics, silverware, and glassware.        Seminar in Fall, 2011    Team taught with S\u00f6ren Stark    Cultural Interactions in Eurasian Art &amp; Archaeology    Cross-cultural inquiries over the Eurasian continent are still, to a considerable degree, hampered both by the fragmenting character of traditional academic divisions (such as Near Eastern, Central Asian, East Asian, South Asian studies) and considerable language barriers. Whereas the current academic divisions encourage the in-depth investigation of issues derived from the &quot;core areas,&quot; it does not facilitate the cross-border inquiry that addresses the interconnectedness between assumed &quot;core areas.&quot;        This seminar is intended to bridge academic gaps by exploring a wealth of cultural interactions between Central Asia and East Asia through a series of representative cases dated from the fifth century BCE to the ninth century CE. In the class we will revisit the so-called &ldquo;Scythian animal style&rdquo; that embodied the art of the steppe stretching from Ukraine to Northern China. We will compare how the Han Chinese perceived the Northern &quot;barbarians&quot; and how the Xiongnu elites expressed their cultural identity themselves by commissioning and consuming prestigious art objects. We will have a closer look at how Soghdian funerary practices and the related visual arts persisted or were subsequently altered in their settlements in Northern China. The class will tackle material culture of Tang China, its shaping and its impact on the T\u00fcrk Qaghanats in the northwest and on Japan in the east. Finally, we will also consider the religious factor in cultural interaction by examining Buddhist grottos in B\u0101miy\u0101n and Dunhuang.           Seminar in Fall, 2010      G44.3010.001     History, Memory, and Media in China    The seminar explores how art objects shape memory and intervene in history in China. It first focuses on bronze vessels and stone steles, investigating how media, intention, and reception influence the operation of commemorative art. It then tackles calligraphy and painting, discussing how the fusion of personal memory and collective memory transforms the tangle of the past and the present.       Prominent cases to be studied include the Simuwu bronze vessel cast in the Shang (c. 1600\u2013c.1050 BCE), the bronze basin inscribed by Qiang in the Western Zhou (c. 1050\u2013771 BCE), the stone steles erected by the First Emperor of the Qin (221\u2013207 BCE), and the Preface to Collected Poems from the Orchid Pavilion written by Wang Xizhi (303\u2013361 CE). Discussions extend to the reception of antiquity in the Song (960\u20131279) and the Qing (1644\u20131911) periods. Comparable western theories and examples will also be examined."}]}]
