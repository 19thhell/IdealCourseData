Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 88 children. ASD can hinder a child's ability to socially interact, communicate, and play. Research tells us that early identification, parent training, and intensive intervention can greatly improve children's lives, giving them the greatest chance of achieving their full potential. If a parent or loved one is concerned that a child may be displaying signs of autism, a comprehensive autism evaluation is recommended.   When to seek treatment?   If your child shows two or more of the signs listed below, an evaluation is recommended. It is important to note that there are no absolute clinical indicators of autism and that the presence of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that your child has autism.   Impairment in social interaction:   Lack of appropriate eye gaze   Lack of warm, joyful expressions   Lack of sharing interest or enjoyment   Lack of response to name   Impairment in communication:   Lack of showing gestures   Lack of coordination of nonverbal communication   Unusual prosody in speech (little variation in pitch, odd intonation, irregular rhythm, unusual voice quality)   Repetitive behaviors and restricted interests:   Repetitive movements with objects   Repetitive movements or posturing of the body, arms, hands, or fingers   Specific narrow interests that the child is very focused on learning or talking about   Evaluations   At the Child Study Center, an evaluation at the Early Childhood Autism and Communication Disorders Service includes three visits with clinical and developmental child psychologists who specialize in evaluating toddlers and young children suspected to have autism or other communication disorders. Evaluations are tailored to the needs of each family and include:   behavioral observation   parent interviews   speech-language evaluation   cognitive assessment   adaptive ability assessment   neuropsychological tests, (i.e., cognitive and achievement tests)   the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)   specialized consults as necessary (e.g. with our psychiatrists)   The tasks administered during the evaluation are designed to be play-based and test the child's beginning understanding of words, as well as concepts such as intention, imitation, and social responsiveness. At the end of the evaluation parents will receive a comprehensive feedback session, detailed recommendations, and an in-depth report. Every evaluation also includes a no-cost Service Navigation consult with our experienced social worker, who will review recommendations and provide support in linking to appropriate therapeutic and educational referrals.   The Child Study Center offers follow-up care for early childhood diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Social Communication Disorder. We will use your evaluation to craft an individualized treatment plan and work with you to implement evidence based practices. We offer specialized treatments including Early Social Interaction Therapy and Pivotal Response Treatment.

Rather, special education refers to specialized services or environments modifications, differentiated instruction, adapted curricula or other supports, provided to students with disabilities. NYU students are encouraged to view all children and their families as individuals with varying degrees of skills and untapped potential for quality lives in schools, work, recreation in their communities.    Classroom, home and community interventions are designed to meet the characteristics, needs, and visions for a valued future of each child, not limited by traditional categories of disability. Respecting the critical role that families play in the lives of children, and the multidimensional nature of providing quality services for complex students, our graduates are prepared to work collaboratively with families, other professionals and the community organizations that represent the wide cultural vartiations characteristic of urban settings.    Integration of theory and practice is interwoven throughout each program, thus allowing graduate students to reflect, question and refine their knowledge and skills. Observation and fieldwork, plus student teaching placements, enable participants to practice application of their skills with children representing the full range of abilities and disabilities, in a range of settings, and withing the full age range of the teaching certificate.    Diversity of Programs    The programs in special education prepare teachers for positions working with students with and without disabilities from birth through grade 6. As described below, at NYU we offer M.A. programs designed to meet New York State requirements for the various teacher certificates:    Early Childhood Education (Birth through Grade 2)       For prospective teachers:       Early Childhood Education and Special Education: Early Childhood (ESEE, Dual Certification)          For those who hold or are eligible for initial/professional teaching certificates:       Special Education: Early Childhood (SEEC)             Childhood Education (Grades 1-6)       For prospective teachers:       Childhood Education and Special Education: Childhood (CSEC, Dual certification)          For those who hold or are eligible for initial/professional teaching certificates:       Special Education: Childhood (SECH)             Our Students    The participants in the M.A. Programs in Special Education very widely in age and background. Some were education majors, but many were liberal arts, business or fine arts majors as undergraduates. Some are making a career change. The diversity of the student population contributes to the richness of the programs. Consequently, program requirements and curricula offerings are designed to be responsive to the diverse backgrounds of our participants. Although graduate students have the option of beginning the program part time, they must be available during the school day throughout the program part time, they must be available during the school day throughout the program to participate in observations and fieldwork. Once the participants begin student teaching, however, full time commitment is required.    Financial Aid Opportunities    The Special Education Program is a participant in the New York City Board of Education incentive program, which provides tuition scholarships to candidates who are fluent in Spanish, Chinese, or French-Creole and who are interested in pursuing teaching careers in bilingual special education. In addition, the program frequently secures federal tuition grants earmarked for particular specializations within the program. Funds for all special grant programs are contingent on annual funding from the granting agencies.       Financial Aid at NYU Steinhardt       Career Opportunities    Graduates work in public and private schools, hospital and community learning units, hospital day treatment programs, group homes, and agencies such as United Cerebral Palsy, Association for the Help of Retarded Citizens, and the Young Adult Institute. Graduates have opened their own schools or established private practices providing academic and behavioral support to students with disabilities.
