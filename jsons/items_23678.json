The clinic offers students the opportunity (1) to compare and contrast different uses of criminal prosecution to combat domestic violence, (2) to develop a critical analysis of the advantages and limitations of various criminal justice strategies, and (3) to assist lawyers, agencies and CBOs working to devise and implement changes in those strategies.   Course Description   Seminar   Domestic violence occurs everywhere, with different resonances in different cultures. Every country has a criminal justice system, but the attempt to use arrest and prosecution as tools against domestic violence is far from universal. Within each nation where domestic violence is prosecuted, there is debate about whether a criminal-court approach will ever make more than a marginal difference. This debate, examined in a comparative and interdisciplinary context, is the focus of the weekly seminar.   Specific areas of inquiry will include mandatory arrest, prosecutorial discretion, no-drop policies, and mandatory reporting to law enforcement by health care providers. In each area we will analyze the potential for racial, cultural, and gender bias in the policy\u2019s implementation. The main points of comparison will be India and the United States.   Fieldwork   All fieldwork placements will be in New York City. They include criminal defense offices, advocacy organizations, and community-based organizations. Every student will have client contact and responsibility, and the placements will offer opportunities ranging from direct representation of an individual to provision of advice to an agency on policy and strategy issues.   In Spring 2012 students worked on criminal defense teams representing battered women accused of crimes in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens with lawyers at the Legal Aid Society and in private practice. Students on the civil side worked with attorneys at Connect, Sanctuary for Families, and Safe Horizon. Students should plan on spending12-20 hours a week on fieldwork (3-5 hours per credit).   Substantial Writing Credit   Students who plan to fulfill this writing requirement in connection with the seminar should meet with Professor Maguigan once during the Fall 2011 semester. Call her at (212) 998-6433 or e-mail to arrange an appointment.   Qualifications for Applicants   This course is open to second-year and third-year JD students, to LLM students, and to MSW and PhD candidates at Silver School of Social Work. There are no prerequisites, but students will find it helpful to have academic training or practical experience in one or more of the following areas: criminal procedure, comparative or international law, evidence, domestic violence counseling, advocacy, litigation or policy, and interdisciplinary work.

The clinic offers students the opportunity (1) to compare and contrast different uses of criminal prosecution to combat domestic violence, (2) to develop a critical analysis of the advantages and limitations of various criminal justice strategies, and (3) to assist lawyers, agencies and CBOs working to devise and implement changes in those strategies.   Course Description   Seminar   Domestic violence occurs everywhere, with different resonances in different cultures. Every country has a criminal justice system, but the attempt to use arrest and prosecution as tools against domestic violence is far from universal. Within each nation where domestic violence is prosecuted, there is debate about whether a criminal-court approach will ever make more than a marginal difference. This debate, examined in a comparative and interdisciplinary context, is the focus of the weekly seminar.   Specific areas of inquiry will include mandatory arrest, prosecutorial discretion, no-drop policies, and mandatory reporting to law enforcement by health care providers. In each area we will analyze the potential for racial, cultural, and gender bias in the policy\u2019s implementation. The main points of comparison will be India and the United States.   Fieldwork   All fieldwork placements will be in New York City. They include criminal defense offices, advocacy organizations, and community-based organizations. Every student will have client contact and responsibility, and the placements will offer opportunities ranging from direct representation of an individual to provision of advice to an agency on policy and strategy issues.   In Spring 2012 students worked on criminal defense teams representing battered women accused of crimes in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens with lawyers at the Legal Aid Society and in private practice. Students on the civil side worked with attorneys at Connect, Sanctuary for Families, and Safe Horizon. Students should plan on spending12-20 hours a week on fieldwork (3-5 hours per credit).   Substantial Writing Credit   Students who plan to fulfill this writing requirement in connection with the seminar should meet with Professor Maguigan once during the Fall 2011 semester. Call her at (212) 998-6433 or e-mail to arrange an appointment.   Qualifications for Applicants   This course is open to second-year and third-year JD students, to LLM students, and to MSW and PhD candidates at Silver School of Social Work. There are no prerequisites, but students will find it helpful to have academic training or practical experience in one or more of the following areas: criminal procedure, comparative or international law, evidence, domestic violence counseling, advocacy, litigation or policy, and interdisciplinary work. Law students who wish to work in the area of criminal defense should have taken criminal procedure and evidence.   Application Procedure   Interested students applying during the Spring 2011 cycle should submit an application, resume and grade transcript through CAMS. Students will be selected on the basis of their applications and interviews with faculty. Please schedule your interview through CAMS. Current CCJ students are available to answer questions: Rosalind Bell, Kimberly Donnelly, Brian Harris, Alice Huling, Marietta Jo, Dahsong Kim, Elena Lobo, Evelyn Malave, Karl Mulloney-Radke, Lauren Restrepo, Anha Vo and Heather Webb.

Course Description   Seminar   Domestic violence occurs everywhere, with different resonances in different cultures. Every country has a criminal justice system, but the attempt to use arrest and prosecution as tools against domestic violence is far from universal. Within each nation where domestic violence is prosecuted, there is debate about whether a criminal-court approach will ever make more than a marginal difference. This debate, examined in a comparative and interdisciplinary context, is the focus of the weekly seminar.   Specific areas of inquiry will include mandatory arrest, prosecutorial discretion, no-drop policies, and mandatory reporting to law enforcement by health care providers. In each area we will analyze the potential for racial, cultural, and gender bias in the policy\u2019s implementation. The main points of comparison will be India and the United States.   Fieldwork   All fieldwork placements will be in New York City. They include criminal defense offices, advocacy organizations, and community-based organizations. Every student will have client contact and responsibility, and the placements will offer opportunities ranging from direct representation of an individual to provision of advice to an agency on policy and strategy issues.   In Spring 2012 students worked on criminal defense teams representing battered women accused of crimes in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens with lawyers at the Legal Aid Society and in private practice. Students on the civil side worked with attorneys at Connect, Sanctuary for Families, and Safe Horizon. Students should plan on spending12-20 hours a week on fieldwork (3-5 hours per credit).   Substantial Writing Credit   Students who plan to fulfill this writing requirement in connection with the seminar should meet with Professor Maguigan once during the Fall 2011 semester. Call her at (212) 998-6433 or e-mail to arrange an appointment.   Qualifications for Applicants   This course is open to second-year and third-year JD students, to LLM students, and to MSW and PhD candidates at Silver School of Social Work. There are no prerequisites, but students will find it helpful to have academic training or practical experience in one or more of the following areas: criminal procedure, comparative or international law, evidence, domestic violence counseling, advocacy, litigation or policy, and interdisciplinary work. Law students who wish to work in the area of criminal defense should have taken criminal procedure and evidence.   Application Procedure   Interested students applying during the Spring 2011 cycle should submit an application, resume and grade transcript through CAMS. Students will be selected on the basis of their applications and interviews with faculty. Please schedule your interview through CAMS. Current CCJ students are available to answer questions: Rosalind Bell, Kimberly Donnelly, Brian Harris, Alice Huling, Marietta Jo, Dahsong Kim, Elena Lobo, Evelyn Malave, Karl Mulloney-Radke, Lauren Restrepo, Anha Vo and Heather Webb.   Places are reserved for transfer and LLM students and for students in the social work school. Their application deadline is October 15, 2011. Transfer and LL.M applicants should use the CAMS procedure described above. (Please note that there is a separate application form for LLM students.) Social work students should download the application form and send it, along with a resume and informal transcript, via e-mail to both Holly Maguigan and Damaris Marrero .

The Domestic Violence Advocacy Project operates two public service programs for students, supervised by Sanctuary for Families, a New York organization that assists battered women.   Through the Courtroom Advocates Program (CAP), law students assist women at Family Court in getting orders of protection from their batterers. For example, student advocates help the women draft their complaints, answer any questions, and assist the women when they appear before the judge.   In the Uncontested Divorce Project, students are trained to assist women in obtaining a divorce from their batterer.   Prior to participating in these programs, law students participate in a full day of training run by Sanctuary for Families. DVAP also brings in speakers throughout the year and sponsors events for Domestic Violence Awareness Month.    This year, DVAP is organizing a performance of The Vagina Monologues for the law school. The performance dates are February 13-15, 2013.
