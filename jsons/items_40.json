Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.    Social History of Photography    ARTH-UA 432 Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.    South Asian Art II: 1200 to Present    ARTH-UA 531 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asian art from ca. 1200 C.E. to the present. It begins with the introduction of Islamic artist traditions into the Indian subcontinent through the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, which effectively integrated itself into a widely diverse and multicultural range of preexisting artistic practices. It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.    Art in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols    ARTH-UA 540 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Provides an outline of Islamic material in its early and classical periods, from 650 to 1200 C.E. The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world. Beginning with the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, traces the development of Islamic art and architecture through the eras of Timur, the \"gunpowder empires\" (the Mughals, Ottomans, Safavids), and European colonialism, to the art of the nation-state in the 20th century.    Arts of Africa    ARTH-UA 560 Identical to SCA-UA 787. Offered periodically. 4 points.   The traditional art of sub-Saharan Africa\u2014its diversity and cultural contexts, as well as its universal aspects\u2014is the subject of this course.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.    Social History of Photography    ARTH-UA 432 Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.    South Asian Art II: 1200 to Present    ARTH-UA 531 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asian art from ca. 1200 C.E. to the present. It begins with the introduction of Islamic artist traditions into the Indian subcontinent through the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, which effectively integrated itself into a widely diverse and multicultural range of preexisting artistic practices. It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.    Art in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols    ARTH-UA 540 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Provides an outline of Islamic material in its early and classical periods, from 650 to 1200 C.E. The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world. Beginning with the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, traces the development of Islamic art and architecture through the eras of Timur, the \"gunpowder empires\" (the Mughals, Ottomans, Safavids), and European colonialism, to the art of the nation-state in the 20th century.    Arts of Africa    ARTH-UA 560 Identical to SCA-UA 787. Offered periodically. 4 points.   The traditional art of sub-Saharan Africa\u2014its diversity and cultural contexts, as well as its universal aspects\u2014is the subject of this course.

Today artists working in the field of social practice focus on aesthetics, ethics, collaboration, media strategies, & social activism as central issues that inform their artworks & projects that are designed for public & social spaces. In the United States, visual art that engaged the public directly began in the late 1950s & coincided with the local \u201cdecentralization\u201d efforts that, in the arts, resulted in community-based art practices that envisioned the public as diverse, socially-engaged, & contributed to an expansive aesthetic consciousness. Understanding this history contextualizes social practice art & allows us to interrogate the ways artists blur the lines between object making, performance, activism, grass roots organizing & pedagogy.

Imagination is assumed to be the primary resource for artists, one that is best used by rejecting constraints through an attitude of limitlessness & radical personal freedom. It is celebrated for its ability to enable people to \u2018think outside the box,\u2019 to innovate & to surprise. Anarchy, as a social & political idea, receives a far more ambivalent welcome. From it\u2019s linguistic roots meaning \u2019without a rule,\u2019 it would seem to be a fellow traveler to the imagination, seeking to scale up the trans-formative potential of the imagination to a social & political scale. But if it is a change in scale, it is one that then challenges use to examine closely the implications of the imagination & to engage with the full complexity of anarchy. The course will explore these ideas through a range of texts by authors such as Andre Breton, Leo Tolstoy, Jean-Paul Sartre, Emma Goldman. Murray Rothbard, Murray Bookchin, David Graeber, & Hakim Bey. Finally, we will consider the questions of lawlessness, violence & insurrection by looking at the writings of Valerie Solanas, the Unibomber, Tiqqun & the Anonomous Collective.

The class will look at the content of artwork, including ideas in contemporary & traditional arts, both Chinese & international, & build various skills to translate ideas into reality. With the medium of Ink, students will use their living experience in Shanghai to integrate & create artwork, with the influences of art that they have been exposed to, personal influences they have experiences, &/or the societal landscape that they see around them. Students will work on individual projects using ink to create paintings, sculpture, or multimedia art. Class time will be devoted to individual & group critiques, lectures, class discussions, & visits to local artists, galleries, & museums. A journal will be kept to record ideas, sketches, references & future plans. By the close of the semester, each students will have a complete body of artwork & participate in an exhibition.

Questions of authenticity & personal revelation will be discussed as they relate to contemporary art practice. Students will complete three studio projects that reflect these & related issues. Because this is an interdisciplinary studio course, any medium, e.g., painting, photo, performance, installation, video, sculpture, drawing, digital, is acceptable as a means to explore class content.

At what point does the obvious become the extraordinary? This course will reexamine the realm of obviousness, clich\u00e9, & boredom as alternate strategies for affecting disappearance both as an art practice as well as a possible act of transgression. Theoretical & literary topics include Michel Foucault, Paul Virillo as well as the science fiction writer Samuel Delaney. We will also be screening films by Georges Melies, Kenneth Anger, & Swiss artist Roman Signer.

We will trace the way these processes are channeled through a language of signs & symbols. The crucial role of visual images within each of these processes will be explored through examples taken from the readings as well as from slide lectures & films by contemporary artists. Designed to provide a set of analytical tools that can be used to interrogate & expand the artistic process, the use of artwork, writing, assignments, & group discussion will provide regular opportunities for students to respond & reflect on the topics introduced.

The goal of the course is to help the student sharpen his/her point-of-view and to develop constructive motivational tools. To aid in the process we will address the conflict between such binaries as: art and craft, art and ideas and the social and physical space of art. Our method will include individual studio meetings, group critiques, presentations and exhibitions of art. Readings and exhibitions will be assigned according to students\u2019 particular research needs. They may include; Philip Fisher, \"Making and Effacing Art\"; Craig Owens, \"Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power and Culture\u201d and James Hillman, \"The Dream and the Underworld\", as well as student suggested readings.

To that end the class will study the relevant writings of Michael Foucault, Roland Barthes and Walter Benjamin while students create a body of work over the semester. Films and artists to be viewed will include Todd Haynes, Jean Luc Godard, Nicki Lee, Vito Acconci and Federico Fellini. In this class, the presentation and discussion of readings, films, and visual art will alternate with individual studio visits and group critiques of student work. Critiques of student projects will consider the philosophical and cultural implications of artistic activity. Students will work in an interdisciplinary manner, using media of their own choosing to explore their forms and ideas within the context of the course's readings and class discussions. Student will also spend time presenting their work and that of other artists to help them develop a vocabulary for discussing and understanding their production as they move towards their thesis project. The course objective is to empower students by expanding their perspectives and skills in artmaking, discussion and critique.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.

Color as a phenomenon is one of the most powerful tools in the artist\u2019s repertoire. It\u2019s relation to perception lies at the heart of our notions of the objective & the subjective. Color will be explored in depth through a series of open-ended projects & a series of short experiment/ assignments.

The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               60    3            ART-GE 2974            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Exhibition Making           A studio course that combines multidisciplinary creative practices & scholarship through the framework of curating & exhibition making. Students will gain hands on experience through the mentorship of guest artists & curators who are presenting exhibitions, in conjunction with the course, at the Art Department\u2019s 80WSE Gallery. Additionally, students will collaborate with these guests on all aspects of production for their projects, including exhibition design, historical research, assembling an exhibition catalogue, borrowing art works from museums & private collections. The activities covered move beyond studio practice, offering primary information & unique insight into the many concerns that comprise any public presentation of artwork.

The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social & cultural. Students will be given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for pictures to 'read' & how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure will at once expose students to the ideas of limits & how the limit or horizon of the possible can be elaborated & expanded on in art. Students will engage in-group & one-on-one discussion of projects made in response to readings & assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration & consistency in a creative practice.

These many ?institutions?: fashion, the museum, the store, the government, the home, & music among them, are all structures, which make up the world in which we live. We will look at how artists utilize these structure as a means to change the way we experience life & living. Each week will be geared towards a specific institution through slide lectures, screenings of films, field trips, & guest artists. There will also be presentations & critiques of student work as well as special topics of interest.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.

The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               45    3            ART-UE 1981            Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Sex and Contemporary Art           This interdisciplinary class combines studio practice & critique with slide lectures, readings, audiovisual material & visits to relevant exhibitions. The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social & cultural. Students will be given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for pictures to 'read' & how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure will at once expose students to the ideas of limits & how the limit or horizon of the possible can be elaborated & expanded on in art. Students will engage in-group & one-on-one discussion of projects made in response to readings & assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration & consistency in a creative practice.

These many ?institutions?: fashion, the museum, the store, the government, the home, & music among them, are all structures, which make up the world in which we live. We will look at how artists utilize these structure as a means to change the way we experience life & living. Each week will be geared towards a specific institution through slide lectures, screenings of films, field trips, & guest artists. There will also be presentations & critiques of student work as well as special topics of interest.
