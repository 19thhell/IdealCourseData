[{"detail": [{"content": "Nature and the Literary Imagination by Professor Keefer        Nature in the Literary Imagination     by Professor Julia Keefer   Spring 2014 New York University  LITR1-UC 6251 SESSION 1 SECTION 1 4 Credits McGhee Division   Wednesdays: 6:20 to 8:50 pm     Through selective study of the Bible, the Koran, Shakespeare, the Romantic poets, American transcendentalists, indigenous authors, contemporary eco-writers, and Integral Ecologists, we explore how humans have described and interacted with nature over the years in different parts of the world. How and why does literature imagine nature? This course focuses on the aesthetics of language, the descriptions of nature, and the explicit and implicit claims embedded in the matrix of literary art. We compare poetic with literary non-fiction scientific writing on the environment, as we speculate on what ecoliterature teaches us about our planet now, in the past, and hopefully in the future.

both a place of horror and suffering, and a place of reflection and possibility . . . in fiction and non-fiction, I\u2019ve crossed this ocean trying to stitch together Africa, Europe, and the Americas in my mind.\u201d Historian Sugata Bose reminds us that down the ages, the Indian Ocean too, has figured as a shared cultural ecumene in literature and art. A conversation between these writers invites us to think about how migration, encounter, and exchange across oceans give meaning to the interconnected worlds in which we live.
