Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.        Islam and Spain: Past and Present   This course, offered both in Spanish and English in Spring 2015 offers an introduction to Islam, with reference to both the Islamic religion as well as to the evolution of the Arab world. Special attention is given to the history of Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) and its important contribution to Europe and America.

The Interwoven Pasts of Spain and Morocco January Term course left us in awe of the gorgeous cities we visited and the incredibly rich and complicated inter-religious history we learned about. Now that it's over, it is hard to believe that the class took only three short weeks of January to complete\u2026so, where to begin this post?                                 Photo Gallery                                                                                                                                                            View photo gallery [2 images]                                            Let's start with Fez. Walking through the narrowest possible roads surrounded by tens of shops of leather products, pottery, shawls, belts, and very persistent Moroccan salesmen, we found Madrasat al-Attarine, a gorgeous piece of architecture designed like many other Madrasas (schools) in 14th-century North Africa, for students \u2014 very much like ourselves \u2014 traveling from faraway lands to seek knowledge.   And I can't forget Grenada. On a cold foggy day, we wandered around the beauty of the palace-city of the Alhambra, witnessing the incredibly gorgeous wooden curves in the ceilings, the pillars, horseshoe arches, and water running from fountains into narrow channels and throughout the whole city. Alhambra was beautiful to see, and it was much more profound within the context it represents.   When I first chose to take the Interwoven Pasts of Spain and Morocco class, I didn't expect to feel so passionately about the history of Iberia. But I later found out that this class is not only about understanding historical events or learning how to write historiographic essays, but also about a deeper personal understanding of our world. The books and articles we've read, discussed, and written about have given us a rigorous academic context of the complex history of medieval Iberia. But the weeklong trip to Morocco and southern Spain provided a completely different level of immersion in this history. Observing locals, speaking to guides, and examining historically important monuments \u2014 from Madrasas, mosques, churches, and synagogues to political palaces and cities \u2014 is a tangible way to reach an understanding of the complexity of history.                                                                               This J-Term was incredible. It managed to combine intensive academic work with a beautiful journey through the past.         Amani Alsaied, NYUAD Class of 2014.                         Whether thinking back to the brief conversations we had with the salesmen in Marrakesh, the chaos of the Moroccan markets, or the surreal and confusing experience of being in a &quot;Mosque-Cathedral&quot; hearing church music while seeing Quranic verses cover the walls of the cathedral in Cordoba, we knew we had witnessed the aftermath of a complicated history.   With trips to Toledo, Marrakesh, Rabat, Fez, Tangiers, Cordoba, Grenada, and Seville, our J-Term course was appropriately named in the syllabus as &quot;Rihla \ufb01 Talab al-'Ilm,&quot; an Arabic expression meaning &quot;a trip in search of knowledge,&quot; because we truly traveled for the sole purpose of seeking knowledge. Neelgoon Safdar, a fellow NYUAD junior who took the class, said, &quot;We are very fortunate to have the opportunity to learn about the history of Spain and Morocco and then be able to physically visit the cities where it all happened. It made the whole experience real. We were trying to relive the history.&quot;   Such a wonderful and rich journey through history could only be possible through the design of a busy yet fruitful J-Term that embodied the vision of NYUAD: to explore life as citizens of the world. I believe that such classes have a magical ability to influence each student in their own ways.   As a third-year student working toward a double major in Film and Theater, I initially chose this class because I wanted to do a concentration in Arab Crossroads. I had no idea that it would be responsible for a more permanent influence on my plans after graduation. Now, I'm restructuring my current semester and my senior year to be able to explore the University's Arab Crossroads program. I want to learn more, to understand how the past brought us to where we are now. Through my J-Term class, I was able to see how studying history is an important part of my learning as an artist who wants to live and create in the Arab World.   This J-Term was incredible. It managed to combine intensive academic work with a beautiful journey through the past. As I write this post from my dorm room in New York, where I'm starting a new spring semester adventure, I feel very thankful to be part of NYUAD.
