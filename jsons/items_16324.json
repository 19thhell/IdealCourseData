Why are formally democratic societies typically characterized by intense struggle over issues of identity and difference, not only race, gender, and sexuality, but also immigration? Our seminar concludes by exploring the relation between democratic regimes and empire, state violence, and national security: how does &quot;democracy&quot; become the name for a regime engaged in permanent war, torture, surveillance of citizens, and suspension of civil liberties?

Cities concentrate our most pressing social and environmental issues while also bringing about innovative responses to these challenges and numerous forms of experimentation.   The Urban Democracy Lab promotes critical, creative, just, and sustainable forms of urbanism, through scholarship, curricular activities, public engagement, and programming.\u00a0 We are especially interested in new forms of urban democracy, whether in governance, activism, self-management, or creative production.
