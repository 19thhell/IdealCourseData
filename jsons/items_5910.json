Surprisingly, most contemporary presidents have found themselves severely constrained in their ability to pursue their chosen agendas for domestic and foreign policy change. This lecture will explain why, focusing on the nature of government bureaucracy, the range of American challenges and commitments, and the development of the modern media. The lecture will emphasize the international factors that have constrained and re-defined presidential power.

TBD: &quot;The Hague as the Cradle of World Peace, 1899-1914,&quot; (Frances Gouda, Bowdoin College)            Abstract:   International Peace Conferences took place in The Hague in the Netherlands in 1899 and 1907; a third conference was being planned for 1914. The International Peace Palace in The Hague was inaugurated in 1913 to become the home of the newly sanctioned International Court of Arbitration. As a result, prominent Dutch politicians and academics began to present the Netherlands \u2013 a small democracy in northern Europe with only a minor voice in international affairs \u2013 as \u201cthe hub of internationalism and the capital of peace in the world.\u201d   In her lecture, Frances Gouda will explore the ways in which these burgeoning Dutch aspirations to become a \u201cworld mediator and beacon of international harmony\u201d were intimately linked to both domestic political developments and the possession of a large and lucrative colony in the Indonesian archipelago in Southeast Asia.     Bio:   Frances Gouda is visiting professor at Bowdoin College. In addition to a wide range of articles and book chapters, she is the author of Poverty and Political Culture: The Rhetoric of Social Welfare in France and the Netherlands, 1815\u20131853 (1994, reprint 1995), American Visions of the Netherlands Indies/Indonesia: US Foreign Policy and Indonesian Nationalism, 1920\u20131949 (2002) and Dutch Culture Overseas: Colonial Practice in the Netherlands Indies, 1900\u20131942 (1995; 2nd ed., 2009).

The commodities exchanged and transported through voyages and sold at markets or bazaars along the Indian Ocean littoral included aromatics, medicines, dyes, spices, grain, wood, textiles, gems, stones, ornaments, metals, and plant and animal products.   While trade might have underpinned many of these relationships, the Ocean was also a highway for the exchange of religious cultures and specialized technologies. The expansion of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam and Christianity helped define the boundaries of this Indian Ocean \u2018world\u2019, creating networks of religious travel and pilgrimage.   This lecture presents an overview of the forces that united the societies of the Indian Ocean world before the 14th century.

But these narratives have remained deeply Eurocentric. In this talk, Sebastian Conrad suggests to read the history of Enlightenment as a history of global conjunctures. Claims to Enlightenment were literally co-produced by historical actors from a variety of locations in their attempt to think globally and come to terms with the challenges of an integrating world.     Bio:   Sebastian Conrad is Professor of Modern History at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. His publications include: German Colonialism: A Short History (Cambridge University Press, 2012); Globalisation and the Nation in Imperial Germany (Cambridge University Press, 2010); The Quest for the Lost Nation: Writing History in Germany and Japan in the American Century (California University Press, 2010).   His introduction into the field of global history (Globalgeschichte: Eine Einf\u00fchrung, Beck) has appeared in German in 2013.                                 March 9, 2014: &quot;A Global History of the African Diaspora&quot; (Patrick Manning, University of Pittsburgh)            Video   Abstract:   The African Diaspora began as involuntary movement of sub-Saharan Africans to Europe, the Americas, and Asia. This same diaspora also became a social structure bringing cultural, political, and social change to the lands of settlement and to the African homeland.   This lecture, which combines local history and world history to show the importance of Africans in the modern world, includes key examples of the African diaspora experience from the Maghreb to the Middle East.     Bio:   Patrick Manning is Andrew W. Mellon Professor of World History at the University of Pittsburgh. He is director of the World History Center, located in the Department of History and affiliated with the Global Studies Program and the University Center of International Studies. Trained as a specialist in the economic history of Africa, he has become a specialist in world history overall.   His research has focused on demographic history (African slave trade), social and cultural history of francophone Africa, global migration, African diaspora as a dimension of global history, and an overview of the field of world history. He was educated at the California Institute of Technology (BS in Chemistry, 1963) and the University of Wisconsin - Madison (MS in History and Economics, PhD in History 1969).   Manning now directs the Collaborative for Historical Information and Analysis (CHIA), for work on creating a world-historical data resource. He is also president of the World History Network, Inc., a nonprofit corporation fostering \u2028research and international exchange in\u2028 world history.   His current research \u2028centers on creating a global historical\u2028 data resource, African populations 1650-1950, global social movements 1989-1992, and on an interdisciplinary history of early humanity in collaboration with Christopher Ehret. Manning served as Vice President of the Teaching Division of the American Historical Association from 2004-2006 as well.                                 April 14, 2014: &quot;Putting Global Intellectual History in its Place&quot; (Janaki Bakhle, Columbia University)            Video   Abstract:   Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883-1966) is a familiar name to historians of modern India. An ardent Hindu nationalist even as a young boy, he was dubbed an anarchist as a student by the British colonial police, and the leader of the rightwing Hindu nationalist party whose extended essay \u201cEssentials of Hindutva\u201d (1922) set the tone for its politics.   Best known for his implication in the assassination of M.K. Gandhi, against whom much of his ire was directed, he was an international figure of some notoriety whose arrest and trial received attention from the international press and figures such as Maxim Gorky.     In writing a history of Savarkar, and by implication the history of a global circuitry of revolutionary concepts, the first fact on the ground that we need to confront is that most ideas that traveled did so because they were responses to imperial rule, which had a remarkable uniformity, even across different national styles and experiences.   Marx, Mazzini or Macaulay were locally received through predominantly anti-imperial lenses; thus the importance of Lenin for anti-colonial thinkers and nationalists. However, the conversion of a Marx, Mazzini, and/or Macaulay into a local idiom raises questions relevant both then and now about whether large explicatory and deterministic frames, such as global capitalism or modernization, were ever meaningfully discrete categories of a global intellectual history.   Savarkar\u2019s case demonstrates that revolutionary concepts and ideas (anarchism, for instance) affiliated laterally: South Asia with the Middle East and with Africa; Senghor with Iqbal, and al-Afghani. By putting global intellectual history in its place we see not just a significant shift of the idea of intellectual history from one location (Europe) to another or several (the rest of the world), but also a seismic shift of significance from the globalizing question to localized answers.   In so doing, we do not lose our original question of a global intellectual history altogether, but it is fundamentally transformed. These are arguments the stakes of which have been particularly high for scholarship on modern Indian history, which I will discuss using the case of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar.   Bio:   Janaki Bakhle is Associate Professor of History at Columbia University, where she teaches South Asian history. Her first book was Two Men and Music: Nationalism, Colonialism and the Making of an Indian Classical Tradition (Oxford University Press, 2005), and she is now at work on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, known as the chief ideologue of Hindu fundamentalism.

Global Visions of Muslim Solidarity from the Age of Empires to the Era of Nation States&quot; (Cemil Aydin, UNC)            Video   Abstract:   It is still very common to refer to a geography and civilizational unit called \u201cthe Muslim World,\u201d not only in newspaper accounts of reactions to the Muhammad Cartoons or the Salman Rushdie Affairs, but also in humanities and social science scholarship, diplomacy, and popular culture. Is the idea of \u201cthe Muslim World\u201d (Alem-i Islam) deriving from the religious notions of \u201cummah\u201d?     Why does the term \u201cthe Muslim World\u201d have such as well-entrenched academic and political credibility, despite the obvious naivet\u00e9 of categorizing one and a half billion people, with a striking range of diversity on every topic, into one imagined geopolitical unity? Why do we find such levels of comfort in imagining the unity of \u201cthe Muslim World,\u201d when comparable terms such as \u201cthe Christian World,\u201d \u201cthe Buddhist World,\u201d or \u201cthe colored races\u201d do not have similar cache anymore?     This lecture will critically discuss the modern history of the idea of the Muslim World and Muslim solidarity from the late 18th century to the present.

Is it even a \u201cmovement\u201d? Is it a-political or is it a cover for terrorism? Is it a route to a meaningful life\u2013an alternate global culture? Or is it an example of ostrich-like escapism?   Countless Tablighis devote themselves to the core program of encouraging fellow Muslims to religious fidelity, and these activities well merit our attention.

Using the &quot;Portuguese stratum&quot; as its narrative thread, the discussion pays close attention to places like Hormuz, Goa, and Malacca. But it also stresses the importance of other &quot;poorer&quot; ports, with similar features, in which Portuguese adventurers and missionaries were very much involved.
