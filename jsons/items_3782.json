[{"detail": [{"content": "While We Were Sleeping     While We Were Sleeping  NYU and the Destruction of New York  A Collection of Pieces in Protest        Printed at McNally-Jackson bookstore, 2012, ISBN 978-1-938-02214-2         \"While We Were Sleeping\" is an urgent call to save Greenwich Village from New York University's uncontrolled expansion. Writers and artists make the case against NYU's plans to devour previous acres of green space, including the spectacular Sasaki Garden, the Key Park children's playground, and a  gorgeous grove of oak trees. All this will go ahead if we don't stop it. The price of our inactivity is twenty years of continuous construction. We will  wake up to discover 2.2 million square feet of office space where our Village used to be. Our alarm clock is ringing.
