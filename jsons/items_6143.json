It kills more men and women in all ethnic groups in the United States than any other disease each year.   At NYU School of Medicine and the NYU Langone Medical Center, we are taking a multi-disciplinary approach to achieve our goal of diminishing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Scientists and physicians at NYU work together quite closely - investigators in The Marc and Ruti Bell Vascular Biology and Disease Program focus on exploring the biology of diseases of the vasculature, while physicians in the NYU Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease work to lower the chance of heart attacks by focusing on the treatment of the most established risk factors recognized today, which are disorders of the blood levels of the fats (lipids) carried by lipoprotein particles, such as VLDL, LDL, and HDL.   We are staffed by an expert faculty group who have extensive experience in both treatment and research aspects of lipid disorders and who are recognized thought leaders in the continuing effort to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Backed by a state of the art patient assessment facility and convenient consultative services at the NYU Langone Medical Center, we offer comprehensive risk assessment of cardiovascular disease and the formulation and implementation of a treatment plan directed towards the attainment of a \"heart healthy\" lipid profile. Once instituted, this treatment plan can often be conveniently maintained by your usual physician.

Scientists and physicians at NYU work together quite closely - investigators in The Marc and Ruti Bell Vascular Biology and Disease Program focus on exploring the biology of diseases of the vasculature, while physicians in the NYU Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease work to lower the chance of heart attacks by focusing on the treatment of the most established risk factors recognized today, which are disorders of the blood levels of the fats (lipids) carried by lipoprotein particles, such as VLDL, LDL, and HDL.   We are staffed by an expert faculty group who have extensive experience in both treatment and research aspects of lipid disorders and who are recognized thought leaders in the continuing effort to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Backed by a state of the art patient assessment facility and convenient consultative services at the NYU Langone Medical Center, we offer comprehensive risk assessment of cardiovascular disease and the formulation and implementation of a treatment plan directed towards the attainment of a \"heart healthy\" lipid profile. Once instituted, this treatment plan can often be conveniently maintained by your usual physician.
