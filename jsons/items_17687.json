At the NYU Langone Medical Center, we believe that personal concern for every study volunteer is vital to the quest for knowledge. If you are a patient at NYU, these rights are in addition to your Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights.     As a participant in a research study/clinical trial, you have the right:      To have enough time to decide whether or not to participate and to make that decision without any pressure from the people who are doing the research.      To address any questions you have to the research team and or Principal Investigator at any time.      To refuse to participate in the study/clinical trial, and to stop participating at any time after you begin the study.      Your decision will not affect your right to your usual care not related to the research.      To be told why the study/clinical trial is being done, what will happen, and what you will be asked to do if you are in the study.      To be told about any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts or side effects that may occur during participation.      To be told whether there are any costs associated with being in the study and whether you will receive any reimbursement for participating in the study.      To be told who will have access to information collected about you, and how your confidentiality will be protected.      To be told whom to contact directly with questions about the research, about research-related injury, and about your rights as a research subject.      To receive a copy of your signed Informed Consent form.     If the study involves treatment or therapy, you have the right:      To be told about the other non-research treatment choices you have.      To be told where treatment is available should you have a research-related injury, and who will pay for research-related treatment.

At the NYU Langone Medical Center, we believe that personal concern for every study volunteer is vital to the quest for knowledge. If you are a patient at NYU, these rights are in addition to your Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights.     As a participant in a research study/clinical trial, you have the right:      To have enough time to decide whether or not to participate and to make that decision without any pressure from the people who are doing the research.      To address any questions you have to the research team and or Principal Investigator at any time.      To refuse to participate in the study/clinical trial, and to stop participating at any time after you begin the study.      Your decision will not affect your right to your usual care not related to the research.      To be told why the study/clinical trial is being done, what will happen, and what you will be asked to do if you are in the study.      To be told about any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts or side effects that may occur during participation.      To be told whether there are any costs associated with being in the study and whether you will receive any reimbursement for participating in the study.      To be told who will have access to information collected about you, and how your confidentiality will be protected.      To be told whom to contact directly with questions about the research, about research-related injury, and about your rights as a research subject.      To receive a copy of your signed Informed Consent form.     If the study involves treatment or therapy, you have the right:      To be told about the other non-research treatment choices you have.      To be told where treatment is available should you have a research-related injury, and who will pay for research-related treatment.
