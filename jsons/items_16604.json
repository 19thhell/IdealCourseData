Experiment:       MEG, or magnetoencephalography, is a noninvasive way to measure magnetic activity in the brain and poses no known health risks. Participation involves lying down with five small electromagnetic markers placed on your head, and looking at or listening to words or pictures while MEG sensors monitor activity in your brain.      Commitment:        Experiments last 1 to 2 hours and can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.

For more specific details about what a visit to our lab entails, please visit our MEG Lab page.      Experiment:       MEG, or magnetoencephalography, is a noninvasive way to measure magnetic activity in the brain and poses no known health risks. Participation involves lying down with five small electromagnetic markers placed on your head, and looking at or listening to words or pictures while MEG sensors monitor activity in your brain.      Commitment:        Experiments last 1 to 2 hours and can be scheduled at a time that is convenient for you.      Compensation:        $10/hour for behavioral studies       $15/hour for MEG studies      Location:        KIT/NYU MEG Joint Research Lab      NYU Department of Psychology: Meyer Building      6 Washington Place, Room 284      New York, NY 10003      Volunteer:         To volunteer for an experiment, write to linguistics.morphlab@nyu.edu .
