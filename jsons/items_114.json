It will examine how nineteenth century practitioners worked the genre didactically and aesthetically to establish a common Latin American imaginary, to educate a burgeoning reading public in worldly tastes and cosmopolitanisms, to take up hemispheric political problems, and to focus on the problems of uneven modernity and the comparative anxieties of Latin Americans looking to Europe and the United Status as models of progress, development and democracy. We will also consider how the chronicle as a journalistic form emphazies a documentary imperative and competes with photography as primary material and cultural currency. In the second half of the course, we will explore the twentieth century journalism of \u201cmaster novelists\u201d whose previous incarnations as journalists shaped their work and consider their literary experiments beyond their conventional interpretations. We will think about the force of photography and visual culture in non-fiction writing, and consider how movements like modernism, surrealism, new journalism and the marvelous real participate in a mutualistic relationship with the cronica as a journalistic and literary form. Finally we will read recent works whose authors exploit the cronicas liminal generic status to invent a new narrative transit between literature, journalism, and historiography while competing with and assimilating the aesthetics and representational force of photography and cinema. A photographic anthology will often accompany the weekly readings.                   Back to Top                     Contact us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Texts and Materials :        Photocopied materials (selection from fiction by Iranian writers) and Persian Fiction Reader  Workbook by Mohammad Mehdi Khorrami and Michael Hillmann.        These proficiency-based textbooks present self-contained lessons with authentic materials dating from the 1980s and 1990s.              G77.1413 Advanced Persian II: Modern Persian Fiction II The  main goal of this course is to increase student efficiency in reading  modern fiction. Throughout the semester students will learn new reading  techniques, expand their vocabulary, and thus improve their reading  speed. The course packet also includes grammatical explanations and  exercises, which are directly related to the selected texts. These  sections are specifically designed to enhance student knowledge of  Persian grammar and syntax.       Students  will also examine the differences between linguistic features of the  texts from early twentieth century and those of contemporary Persian.  In addition, students will study the influence of Arabic on the Persian  language. Ultimately, the course offers a better understanding of the  Persian language and its evolution in the past one hundred years.       By  the end of the semester, students will be able, with reasonable  facility, to read and interpret modern Persian fiction for either  research purposes or for their literary and artistic value.       Texts and Materials :       The required course text will be a packet of readings selected from       Siahatnameh-ye Ebrahim Beyg, Zeyn al-Abedin Maraghe'i      Tuti, Zakaria Hashemi      Tangsir, Sadeq Chubak      Buf-e Kur, Sadeq Hedayat \"Mehman-e Nakhandeh dar Shahr-e Bozorg\", Bahram Sadeqi      Dai Jan Napoleon, Iraj Pezeshkzad      Shazdeh Ehtejab, Hushang Golshiri \"Amadeh Budam ba Dokhtaram Chay Bekhoram\", Shiva Arastuyi              All materials will be available in Xerox form.

It will examine how nineteenth century practitioners worked the genre didactically and aesthetically to establish a common Latin American imaginary, to educate a burgeoning reading public in worldly tastes and cosmopolitanisms, to take up hemispheric political problems, and to focus on the problems of uneven modernity and the comparative anxieties of Latin Americans looking to Europe and the United Status as models of progress, development and democracy. We will also consider how the chronicle as a journalistic form emphazies a documentary imperative and competes with photography as primary material and cultural currency. In the second half of the course, we will explore the twentieth century journalism of \u201cmaster novelists\u201d whose previous incarnations as journalists shaped their work and consider their literary experiments beyond their conventional interpretations. We will think about the force of photography and visual culture in non-fiction writing, and consider how movements like modernism, surrealism, new journalism and the marvelous real participate in a mutualistic relationship with the cronica as a journalistic and literary form. Finally we will read recent works whose authors exploit the cronicas liminal generic status to invent a new narrative transit between literature, journalism, and historiography while competing with and assimilating the aesthetics and representational force of photography and cinema. A photographic anthology will often accompany the weekly readings.

How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence. Promised: By the end of the class, you will have been able to  comprehend this course description. Prepare to be reset! Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.
