Description       After a century studying mental disease and pathology, contemporary psychologists have recently charted a \u201cnew\u201d research agenda devoted to human happiness, flourishing, and positive emotions. This new science of happiness deploys modern quantitative and neuroimaging methods towards the goal of discovering the secrets of human well being. Already, this new science has many critics and adherents. In important ways, the emerging research harkens back to seminal work of William James on the\u00a0 Varieties of Religious Experience \u00a0. At the same time it is rediscovering and reinvigorating ancient philosophical and religious traditions that go back for millennia. This seminar takes advantage of the renewed interest in the good life to compare and contrast modern \u201cpositive psychology\u201d with its critics and with other wisdom traditions.

Description       After a century studying mental disease and pathology, contemporary psychologists have recently charted a \u201cnew\u201d research agenda devoted to human happiness, flourishing, and positive emotions. This new science of happiness deploys modern quantitative and neuroimaging methods towards the goal of discovering the secrets of human well being. Already, this new science has many critics and adherents. In important ways, the emerging research harkens back to seminal work of William James on the\u00a0 Varieties of Religious Experience \u00a0. At the same time it is rediscovering and reinvigorating ancient philosophical and religious traditions that go back for millennia. This seminar takes advantage of the renewed interest in the good life to compare and contrast modern \u201cpositive psychology\u201d with its critics and with other wisdom traditions. Authors we read include Seligman, Csikszentmihalyi, Lyubomirsky, Freud, Maslow, Ehrenreich, James, Plato, Epicurus, Epictetus, Aurelius, Seneca, Montaigne, Origen, Saint Teresa of Avila, Merton, Buddha, Dogen, and Nhat Hanh.
