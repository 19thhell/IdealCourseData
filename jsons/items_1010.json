There's also a lively SHERP-only e-mail listserv; if you're a graduate or a current student, you can join the discussion . Many of our alumni, students and faculty are on Twitter, so follow us !   More than 170 alumni, students and friends of SHERP gathered in the fall of 2012 to celebrate our 30th anniversary , which included a panel discussion ( watch the video !) with best-selling authors Rebecca Skloot and Mary Roach and Radiolab creator Jad Abumrad. In 2007, we celebrated our 25th anniversary with a full day of events , including a symposium on artificial life featuring famed geneticist J. Craig Venter and the debut of a ten-minute video about the history of SHERP.\u00a0     A Message to SHERP/SERP Alumnae, Alumni and Friends :   You already know about the sacrifices required to finance a top-flight graduate education. Now you can assist current and future students by contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund . All proceeds are used for tuition-remission scholarships for deserving SHERP students, based on need and achievement. You can make a tax-deductible contribution online via this secure site or can send a check made out to New York University, with 'Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund' written in the lower left corner. The address is: Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund c/o Carter Journalism Institute, 20 Cooper Square, NY, NY 10003.   And to all our donors , thank you!     SHERP and SERP, Year by Year, Counting Backwards...   The list below reflects the last known professional position held by each SHERP and SERP graduate all the way back to the first classes in the 1980s.\u00a0(We added the 'H' in 2005 to reflect the program's longtime emphasis on health and medical journalism.)

Research with Human Subjects       University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects   Welcome to the University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (UCAIHS) website! The site has been designed to help you:     Determine if your work must be reviewed and approved by the UCAIHS;   Understand federal regulations and NYU policies concerning human subjects in research;   Prepare an application for review and approval to the UCAIHS;   Respond to any concerns or requested revisions the UCAIHS may request after the initial review.                                                           About UCAIHS                                                                                         Application Process                                                                                         Forms & Guidance                                         At New York University, all research involving human subjects (funded or not funded) must be reviewed and approved by the University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) before being carried out. The UCAIHS, which serves as NYU's IRB for the Washington Square units of the University, is authorized to review and approve research involving human subjects through an agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Human Research Protections called a Federal Wide Assurance.   See the section on How to Apply to get started with the application process, including whether your proposed work requires UCAIHS review and approval.   Investigators should keep in mind that it is NYU policy that all applicants (and faculty sponsors) to the UCAIHS must take the Human Subjects Tutorial and pass the Certification Exam in order for the UCAIHS to review their application.

There's also a lively SHERP-only e-mail listserv; if you're a graduate or a current student, you can join the discussion . Many of our alumni, students and faculty are on Twitter, so follow us !   More than 170 alumni, students and friends of SHERP gathered in the fall of 2012 to celebrate our 30th anniversary , which included a panel discussion ( watch the video !) with best-selling authors Rebecca Skloot and Mary Roach and Radiolab creator Jad Abumrad. In 2007, we celebrated our 25th anniversary with a full day of events , including a symposium on artificial life featuring famed geneticist J. Craig Venter and the debut of a ten-minute video about the history of SHERP.\u00a0     A Message to SHERP/SERP Alumnae, Alumni and Friends :   You already know about the sacrifices required to finance a top-flight graduate education. Now you can assist current and future students by contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund . All proceeds are used for tuition-remission scholarships for deserving SHERP students, based on need and achievement. You can make a tax-deductible contribution online via this secure site or can send a check made out to New York University, with 'Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund' written in the lower left corner. The address is: Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund c/o Carter Journalism Institute, 20 Cooper Square, NY, NY 10003.   And to all our donors , thank you!     SHERP and SERP, Year by Year, Counting Backwards...   The list below reflects the last known professional position held by each SHERP and SERP graduate all the way back to the first classes in the 1980s.\u00a0(We added the 'H' in 2005 to reflect the program's longtime emphasis on health and medical journalism.)
