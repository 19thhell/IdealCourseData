Wagner School of Public Service   COMMUNITY HEALTH AND MEDICAL CARE - P11.1830     Spring 2003      Prof. Victor Rodwin          Tuesdays, 8:10-9:50 PM  Shimkin Hall Rm. 333        Ph. 998-7459  Office: 4 Washington Squre North, Rm. 51  E-mail: victor.rodwin@wagner.nyu.edu      Assistant: Zuzanna Kobrzynski: 212-998-7435, zk3@nyu.edu      COURSE SYLLABUS     This introductory course in the Health Policy and Management  Program is designed to familiarize students with some of the basic concepts and ideas concerning  the distribution of health and illness in our nation, the organization of the health care  system, and the relationship of one to the other. Definitions of health and illness, and tools  for their assessment, as well as the historical context for developments in public health and  medicine, are discussed and debated. Concerns about the uneven distribution of illness and  health care resources in the United States and other nations are also analyzed in the  context of trends in the distribution of disease and in the organization of health  services and health personnel.     Students should come to class ready to discuss and debate the major  themes related to urban health and society, the social geography and distribution of disease,  as well as the policy environment that influences access to public health and health care  services.     BOOKS AND READINGS     Three textbooks are required.  They are available at NYU's Professional bookstore. Specified chapters or  articles from these texts are required each week. The articles in the book  edited by Conrad and Kern provide a sociological view, and critique, of  health and health care delivery. The chapters in the Kovner and Jonas  textbook describe the organization of the health care delivery system in  the United States. The articles and chapters incorporated in the reader  edited by Lee and Estes provide insight into health politics and policy.  Together, these three texts will provide students with a strong foundation  for their future studies and health care careers.      In addition to these required texts, students  will be assigned readings in a popular book by Nuland, the book by Randy Shilts and the  book by Lynn Payer. Nuland will be used to deepen the understanding of  the issues raised in Class XI (the role of the patient and relevant  ethical issues). The book by Randy Shilts provides case study materials  on the evolution of the AIDS epidemic. Lynn Payer's book provides an  international perspective on the cultural dimensions of medicine. All  of these texts are available on reserve at Bobst Library, most medical  libraries, and through the NYU Professional Bookstore.

Definitions of health and illness, and tools  for their assessment, as well as the historical context for developments in public health and  medicine, are discussed and debated. Concerns about the uneven distribution of illness and  health care resources in the United States and other nations are also analyzed in the  context of trends in the distribution of disease and in the organization of health  services and health personnel.     Students should come to class ready to discuss and debate the major  themes related to urban health and society, the social geography and distribution of disease,  as well as the policy environment that influences access to public health and health care  services.     BOOKS AND READINGS     Three textbooks are required.  They are available at NYU's Professional bookstore. Specified chapters or  articles from these texts are required each week. The articles in the book  edited by Conrad and Kern provide a sociological view, and critique, of  health and health care delivery. The chapters in the Kovner and Jonas  textbook describe the organization of the health care delivery system in  the United States. The articles and chapters incorporated in the reader  edited by Lee and Estes provide insight into health politics and policy.  Together, these three texts will provide students with a strong foundation  for their future studies and health care careers.      In addition to these required texts, students  will be assigned readings in a popular book by Nuland, the book by Randy Shilts and the  book by Lynn Payer.

Call for Papers Workshop: Dissecting Society. Periodical Literature and Social Observation (1830-1850) CIRHUS, New York University, 20th of March 2015 Between 1830 and 1850, on a rapidly expanding print market, a vast amount of short literary pieces on cultural manners, social types and societal developments appeared in the European press and beyond. These \u201cprotosociological sketches\u201c (M. Lauster) or \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c (W. Benjamin) were published in the periodical press as well as in serial collections frequently illustrated with engravings. Assembling an extensive array of urban and rural types, these literary and visual sketches, commissioned to writers, aimed at constructing a total view of a city or of a nation, and were later to appear in compilations such as Paris, ou le livre des cent-et-un, Heads of the People or Los espa\u00f1oles pintados por s\u00ed mismos, to name just a few. In trying to reveal outer appearances and inner logics of their period, these sketches reflect on concepts such as \u201cculture\u201d, \u201csociety\u201d and \u201cnation\u201d. Even though there has been a considerable amount of studies about \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c in terms of literary criticism, its alliances with the emerging humanities and social sciences has rarely been studied. This workshop aims at stimulating an interdisciplinary and transnational approach to this literary corpus, in order to reconsider it vis-\u00e0-vis the emergence of the social sciences. The workshop will be held on the 20th of March 2015 at the Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences at New York University. It will bring together researchers from any discipline related to panoramic literature (and its visual production) as early forms of sociological observation within a history of knowledge. Comprised of 15-20 minutes presentations integrated into panels, the workshop will provide an opportunity to exchange ideas, to advance work in progress and nourish new collaborations. We encourage the submission of papers, especially of those sharing work in progress. Topics covered may include: - Delimiting \u201cproto-sociological\u201c or \u201cpanoramic\u201c literature in an interdisciplinary perspective: borders, overlaps, modes of definition (e.g. interdependencies with statistical, economic or antiquarian works, with urban portrait and reportage, political journalism, or travel literature) - Recurrent lines of discourse of social observation (social classes and money as structuring features, the rise of \u201cnew\u201c values, new technologies, declining customs and professions). - Conditions of reception: readership and social/political impact of the sketches - National/regional differences and interregional/transnational circulations/ adaptations of sociological knowledge - Text-image relationships in relation to emerging forms of sociological and ethnographical representation. - Epistemology: scientific currents and the adaptation of patterns of knowledge (zoology, botany, medicine, physiology, physiognomy, biology\u2026) - Evaluations of societal questions and ideologies - The city as context and content of social observation, institutions of knowledge, and the rise of social science Please send your abstract by November 30, 2014 (400 words maximum) to christiane.schwab@hu-berlin.de. The conference language will be English. You will be notified about your participation by December 10. We will ask the participants to submit a readable draft of their presentation by March 1. We will then distribute these papers among the rest of the participants.             Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Definitions of health and illness, and tools  for their assessment, as well as the historical context for developments in public health and  medicine, are discussed and debated. Concerns about the uneven distribution of illness and  health care resources in the United States and other nations are also analyzed in the  context of trends in the distribution of disease and in the organization of health  services and health personnel.     Students should come to class ready to discuss and debate the major  themes related to urban health and society, the social geography and distribution of disease,  as well as the policy environment that influences access to public health and health care  services.     BOOKS AND READINGS     Three textbooks are required.  They are available at NYU's Professional bookstore. Specified chapters or  articles from these texts are required each week. The articles in the book  edited by Conrad and Kern provide a sociological view, and critique, of  health and health care delivery. The chapters in the Kovner and Jonas  textbook describe the organization of the health care delivery system in  the United States. The articles and chapters incorporated in the reader  edited by Lee and Estes provide insight into health politics and policy.  Together, these three texts will provide students with a strong foundation  for their future studies and health care careers.      In addition to these required texts, students  will be assigned readings in a popular book by Nuland, the book by Randy Shilts and the  book by Lynn Payer. Nuland will be used to deepen the understanding of  the issues raised in Class XI (the role of the patient and relevant  ethical issues). The book by Randy Shilts provides case study materials  on the evolution of the AIDS epidemic. Lynn Payer's book provides an  international perspective on the cultural dimensions of medicine. All  of these texts are available on reserve at Bobst Library, most medical  libraries, and through the NYU Professional Bookstore.

Call for Papers Workshop: Dissecting Society. Periodical Literature and Social Observation (1830-1850) CIRHUS, New York University, 20th of March 2015 Between 1830 and 1850, on a rapidly expanding print market, a vast amount of short literary pieces on cultural manners, social types and societal developments appeared in the European press and beyond. These \u201cprotosociological sketches\u201c (M. Lauster) or \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c (W. Benjamin) were published in the periodical press as well as in serial collections frequently illustrated with engravings. Assembling an extensive array of urban and rural types, these literary and visual sketches, commissioned to writers, aimed at constructing a total view of a city or of a nation, and were later to appear in compilations such as Paris, ou le livre des cent-et-un, Heads of the People or Los espa\u00f1oles pintados por s\u00ed mismos, to name just a few. In trying to reveal outer appearances and inner logics of their period, these sketches reflect on concepts such as \u201cculture\u201d, \u201csociety\u201d and \u201cnation\u201d. Even though there has been a considerable amount of studies about \u201cpanoramic literature\u201c in terms of literary criticism, its alliances with the emerging humanities and social sciences has rarely been studied. This workshop aims at stimulating an interdisciplinary and transnational approach to this literary corpus, in order to reconsider it vis-\u00e0-vis the emergence of the social sciences. The workshop will be held on the 20th of March 2015 at the Center for International Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences at New York University. It will bring together researchers from any discipline related to panoramic literature (and its visual production) as early forms of sociological observation within a history of knowledge. Comprised of 15-20 minutes presentations integrated into panels, the workshop will provide an opportunity to exchange ideas, to advance work in progress and nourish new collaborations. We encourage the submission of papers, especially of those sharing work in progress. Topics covered may include: - Delimiting \u201cproto-sociological\u201c or \u201cpanoramic\u201c literature in an interdisciplinary perspective: borders, overlaps, modes of definition (e.g. interdependencies with statistical, economic or antiquarian works, with urban portrait and reportage, political journalism, or travel literature) - Recurrent lines of discourse of social observation (social classes and money as structuring features, the rise of \u201cnew\u201c values, new technologies, declining customs and professions). - Conditions of reception: readership and social/political impact of the sketches - National/regional differences and interregional/transnational circulations/ adaptations of sociological knowledge - Text-image relationships in relation to emerging forms of sociological and ethnographical representation. - Epistemology: scientific currents and the adaptation of patterns of knowledge (zoology, botany, medicine, physiology, physiognomy, biology\u2026) - Evaluations of societal questions and ideologies - The city as context and content of social observation, institutions of knowledge, and the rise of social science Please send your abstract by November 30, 2014 (400 words maximum) to christiane.schwab@hu-berlin.de.
