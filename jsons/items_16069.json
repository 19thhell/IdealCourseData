Completed applications should be submitted to the Office of Global Programs, 110 East 14th Street, Lower Level by February 15th for the academic year or fall term only and by September 15th for the spring semester.   Housing: As the University of Amsterdam does not have a campus per se, student residences are scattered throughout the city. Rooms are furnished, and sheets and kitchen equipment can be rented. There is a housing deposit fee (approximately $425) and an administrative fee (approximately $15). Some students prefer to rent private apartments by themselves or with roommates. Rent for a single room in Amsterdam varies from approximately \u20ac350 to \u20ac700 per month.   Since there is a shortage of rooms in Amsterdam, very strict regulations on the reservation of rooms have been made by the University of Amsterdam. The Universiteit van Amsterdam will do their utmost to arrange housing for exchange students. For more information on housing, please click here .   Other Expenses: In addition to housing costs, students should expect to spend \u20ac400 to \u20ac600 per month on other living expenses. A Residence Permit, mandatory for all international students, will cost \u20ac433 (as of August 2010) for US citizens. This one-time fee is non-refundable. The cost of books and other study materials will vary by course, but students should allow around \u20ac800 per semester for such expenses.   Jobs: Students from non-EU countries need a work permit in order to hold a job in the Netherlands, and may work up to ten hours per week. For more information about work permits, click here .   Student Services: To help students find their way to the University and in the city itself, the Universiteit van Amsterdam has set up the International Student Network (ISN).

London, England                                                  University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)                               NYU in London is delighted to continue its partnership with the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), one of the world's preeminent centers for research in African studies. This exciting program is open to both NYU and non-NYU students during the fall term only and allows students to immerse themselves in academic life at a specialized British institution while taking course work at the NYU in London Center. As part of the program, students choose from Africana studies courses at SOAS and Africana studies courses at NYU in London. Courses available at SOAS include African Language Literatures, Culture in Africa, Contemporary African Literature, Language in Africa, and Perspectives on African Experience . (Please note that SOAS courses outside of this selection are not open to NYU in London students, and students on the NYU in London cannot enroll directly in University of London courses.) Africana Studies courses at NYU in London include Introduction to Black Urban Studies and Introduction to Pan Africanism .                    Madrid, Spain (Year or Spring Only)                                                  Universidad Autonoma de Madrid                                  While students may take all their course requirements at the NYU Madrid academic center, in the spring semester students may opt to take a course at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). One of the most prestigious universities in Spain, the UAM is located approximately 25 minutes by train from NYU Madrid center and boasts a modern, attractive campus.   Students who enroll in courses at UAM are expected to have an excellent command of the Spanish language, and their course selection must be arranged and approved by the NYU Madrid staff. As the spring semester at the UAM runs from mid-February to the end of May, with final exams taking place in June any student considering taking a course at the UAM should not plan on leaving Spain until the end of June.                      Paris, France                                                  The University of Paris  Universities (Paris I, III, VII, X),Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur                                  Founded in 1257 by the theologian and chaplain of Saint Louis, Robert de Sorbon, the Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne became the center of theological studies. The Sorbonne was closed in 1790, and its buildings became part of the University of Paris in 1808. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the University of Paris expanded both academically (beyond the study of theology) and physically (beyond its original location in the Latin Quarter). In 1968, the University of Paris was divided into three independent entities located in and around Paris.   Since that division, the system has grown to include 13 different universities, and the Sorbonne has become a complex of buildings serving the needs of these universities.   During the academic year NYU Paris has a formal student exchange arrangement between NYU Paris and the University of Paris VII (Denis Diderot). The arrangement permits NYU in Paris students to obtain university student cards and to have a large choice of courses. Students may also take courses at other Universities (Paris I, III, X) or specialized institutions such as the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, and Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur. Students enrolled in the French university system attend classes with native speakers of French. Advanced students in Program II typically take one course in the French university system and the rest of their courses at the NYU center.   Registration for French university courses takes place at the Paris center, upon your arrival in France in consultation with the NYU Paris staff. Areas of interest to NYU students and in which these universities excel include literature, history, language methodology and phonetics, cinema, political science, anthropology, and art history. Students\u2019 work is supervised and evaluated in tutorial sessions with NYU faculty members and the Paris director.

Paris, France                                                  The University of Paris  Universities (Paris I, III, VII, X),Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur                                  Founded in 1257 by the theologian and chaplain of Saint Louis, Robert de Sorbon, the Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne became the center of theological studies. The Sorbonne was closed in 1790, and its buildings became part of the University of Paris in 1808. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the University of Paris expanded both academically (beyond the study of theology) and physically (beyond its original location in the Latin Quarter). In 1968, the University of Paris was divided into three independent entities located in and around Paris.   Since that division, the system has grown to include 13 different universities, and the Sorbonne has become a complex of buildings serving the needs of these universities.   During the academic year NYU Paris has a formal student exchange arrangement between NYU Paris and the University of Paris VII (Denis Diderot). The arrangement permits NYU in Paris students to obtain university student cards and to have a large choice of courses. Students may also take courses at other Universities (Paris I, III, X) or specialized institutions such as the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, and Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur. Students enrolled in the French university system attend classes with native speakers of French. Advanced students in Program II typically take one course in the French university system and the rest of their courses at the NYU center.   Registration for French university courses takes place at the Paris center, upon your arrival in France in consultation with the NYU Paris staff. Areas of interest to NYU students and in which these universities excel include literature, history, language methodology and phonetics, cinema, political science, anthropology, and art history. Students\u2019 work is supervised and evaluated in tutorial sessions with NYU faculty members and the Paris director.
