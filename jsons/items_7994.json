American Anthropological Association, Archaeology Division Monograph 8.      Gender and Archaeology (1996) (editor) - University of Pennsylvania Press.  Current News/Projects Updated August 2014 My research continues to be focused on the Near East and South Asia.   This year (2014) the American Anthropological Association will hold its   annual meeting in Washington D.C. and I have organized the session, Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage 2014 and Beyond .   Throughout history, Afghanistan has stood at a crossroads of   civilizations and a meeting of cultures visible in its monuments,   especially from the Islamic, Buddhist, and Hellenistic periods. The   names of great men like Babur and Alexander the Great have made their   place in history there. Equally significant and less well known are the   country's pre- and proto-historic past that continues to be at risk. In   the session, we will approach the years ahead by revisiting successful   projects undertaken to preserve the country's archaeological sites and   material culture in museums and on the ground during years of conflict.   Our call is the urgent need to join with Afghan scholars, American   archaeologists with varied expertise and others to save Afghanistan's   past, as the country moves forward toward increased development and   changed geopolitical realities. It is with these concerns that I   traveled to Afghanistan in July 2011 with my collaborator, Joseph   Schuldenrein, a geoarchaeologist, to the sites of Mes Aynak, where a   salvage project is taking place to preserve a major Buddhist site. The   site is located on one of the world's largest copper mines soon to be   subjected to strip mining. My purpose was to explore the Mes Aynak   landscape for evidence of ancient mining and settlement in the   prehistoric periods, coincident with the extensive trade in copper and   tin in the third millennium B.C.E. There are promising possibilities but   conducting research in the field will have to wait and now revert to   the laboratory. At the AAA meetings we will present preliminary results   of a mapping project, Mapping on Afghanistan's Archaeological and   Natural Resources, co-authored by myself, Carrie Hritz, Vincent Pigott,   Joseph Schuldenrein, and Reed Goodman. This paper chronicles part of   Afghanistan's global past, by compiling a gazetteer of archaeological   sites and its natural resource. The map integrates publicly available   satellite imagery and paper maps with past archaeological data sets in a   GIS format. Collectively, these data record millennia-long,   longitudinal shifts in human settlement, and present archaeological   landscapes that have since disappeared. A preliminary analysis of Bronze   Age settlement and its relationship to known natural resources suggests   that prehistoric sites were spatially dependent, and indicate that,   even at this early date, Afghanistan figured prominently in the Bronze   Age economy of the greater Middle East. Finally, in 2013 I organized the   conference, Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage. Honoring Omar Khan   Massoudi, in celebration of an Honorary Degree awarded to Mr. Massoudi   at NYU's 2013 commencement. Mr. Massoudi is the Director of National   Museums of Afghanistan. The conference was funded by ISAW, the   Department of Anthropology, the Center for Ancient Studies, and   CNRS/NYU. In a related project, I organized a Forum/Workshop at   the Society for American Archaeological meetings in 2013 on the renewed   interest among climatologists on the effects of climate change in South   Asia. Colleagues conducting regional research in key areas of Pakistan   and India were brought together to evaluate settlement histories,   ecological variabilities and adaptations in the face of climate change   (co-organized with Steven Weber and Joe Schuldenrein). The focus of this   session was on establishing collaborative approaches that better   document the relationship between climate change and human   adaptabilities. Claims that climate change events provide useful models   for resolving present-day debates necessitates understandings of the   complexities of climate change, the historical component that documents   human reactions to change and regional variabilities. I presented some   of our results at a paper delivered in Stockholm, Sweden in July 2014,   sponsored by the European Association of South Asian Archaeology and Art   (EASAA). The EASAA conference was my second trip to Stockholm.   The first was in June 2013, when I was invited by the Axel and Margaret   Axeson Johnson Foundation to contribute to a conference on   Civilizations, the results of which are now published in Civilisation, Perspectives from the Engelsberg Seminar 2013    (2014). Contributors included twenty-nine scholars from around the   world, who lectured on topics as broad ranging as prehistory and the   modern era, present and past politics, and philosophy. I also joined a   small group of four other scholars at a follow-on seminar. Thirty   students and faculty from Upsala and Ludden Universities continued   discussions on various aspects of civilizations, including the problem   of American power, aspects of war and disarmament, philosophy and   modernity, and the \"decline\" of the west. The seminars were held at   Engelsberg Ironworks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where some of the   finest iron was produced in the 17th and 18th centuries, though iron   production began there in the 13th century. Several new   publications in 2013 are available on the department website. They   include \"Commodities and Things - The Kulli in Context.\" Editors, S.   Abraham, P. Gulpalli, T. Raczek, U. Rizvi.

Current News/Projects Updated August 2014 My research continues to be focused on the Near East and South Asia.   This year (2014) the American Anthropological Association will hold its   annual meeting in Washington D.C. and I have organized the session, Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage 2014 and Beyond .   Throughout history, Afghanistan has stood at a crossroads of   civilizations and a meeting of cultures visible in its monuments,   especially from the Islamic, Buddhist, and Hellenistic periods. The   names of great men like Babur and Alexander the Great have made their   place in history there. Equally significant and less well known are the   country's pre- and proto-historic past that continues to be at risk. In   the session, we will approach the years ahead by revisiting successful   projects undertaken to preserve the country's archaeological sites and   material culture in museums and on the ground during years of conflict.   Our call is the urgent need to join with Afghan scholars, American   archaeologists with varied expertise and others to save Afghanistan's   past, as the country moves forward toward increased development and   changed geopolitical realities. It is with these concerns that I   traveled to Afghanistan in July 2011 with my collaborator, Joseph   Schuldenrein, a geoarchaeologist, to the sites of Mes Aynak, where a   salvage project is taking place to preserve a major Buddhist site. The   site is located on one of the world's largest copper mines soon to be   subjected to strip mining. My purpose was to explore the Mes Aynak   landscape for evidence of ancient mining and settlement in the   prehistoric periods, coincident with the extensive trade in copper and   tin in the third millennium B.C.E. There are promising possibilities but   conducting research in the field will have to wait and now revert to   the laboratory. At the AAA meetings we will present preliminary results   of a mapping project, Mapping on Afghanistan's Archaeological and   Natural Resources, co-authored by myself, Carrie Hritz, Vincent Pigott,   Joseph Schuldenrein, and Reed Goodman. This paper chronicles part of   Afghanistan's global past, by compiling a gazetteer of archaeological   sites and its natural resource. The map integrates publicly available   satellite imagery and paper maps with past archaeological data sets in a   GIS format. Collectively, these data record millennia-long,   longitudinal shifts in human settlement, and present archaeological   landscapes that have since disappeared. A preliminary analysis of Bronze   Age settlement and its relationship to known natural resources suggests   that prehistoric sites were spatially dependent, and indicate that,   even at this early date, Afghanistan figured prominently in the Bronze   Age economy of the greater Middle East. Finally, in 2013 I organized the   conference, Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage. Honoring Omar Khan   Massoudi, in celebration of an Honorary Degree awarded to Mr. Massoudi   at NYU's 2013 commencement. Mr. Massoudi is the Director of National   Museums of Afghanistan. The conference was funded by ISAW, the   Department of Anthropology, the Center for Ancient Studies, and   CNRS/NYU. In a related project, I organized a Forum/Workshop at   the Society for American Archaeological meetings in 2013 on the renewed   interest among climatologists on the effects of climate change in South   Asia. Colleagues conducting regional research in key areas of Pakistan   and India were brought together to evaluate settlement histories,   ecological variabilities and adaptations in the face of climate change   (co-organized with Steven Weber and Joe Schuldenrein). The focus of this   session was on establishing collaborative approaches that better   document the relationship between climate change and human   adaptabilities. Claims that climate change events provide useful models   for resolving present-day debates necessitates understandings of the   complexities of climate change, the historical component that documents   human reactions to change and regional variabilities. I presented some   of our results at a paper delivered in Stockholm, Sweden in July 2014,   sponsored by the European Association of South Asian Archaeology and Art   (EASAA). The EASAA conference was my second trip to Stockholm.   The first was in June 2013, when I was invited by the Axel and Margaret   Axeson Johnson Foundation to contribute to a conference on   Civilizations, the results of which are now published in Civilisation, Perspectives from the Engelsberg Seminar 2013    (2014). Contributors included twenty-nine scholars from around the   world, who lectured on topics as broad ranging as prehistory and the   modern era, present and past politics, and philosophy. I also joined a   small group of four other scholars at a follow-on seminar. Thirty   students and faculty from Upsala and Ludden Universities continued   discussions on various aspects of civilizations, including the problem   of American power, aspects of war and disarmament, philosophy and   modernity, and the \"decline\" of the west. The seminars were held at   Engelsberg Ironworks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where some of the   finest iron was produced in the 17th and 18th centuries, though iron   production began there in the 13th century. Several new   publications in 2013 are available on the department website. They   include \"Commodities and Things - The Kulli in Context.\" Editors, S.   Abraham, P. Gulpalli, T. Raczek, U. Rizvi.

During the preceding centuries China had seen a number of invasions by northern tribes, and by the late fourth century much of northern China was controlled by non-Chinese Xianbei rulers who established the Northern Wei dynasty. The Northern Qi were the successors to the Eastern Wei regime, and the dynasty was founded by Gao Huan, formerly the power behind the Eastern Wei throne. The dynasty was ruled by a series of his sons and grandsons until it was conquered in 577 by the Northern Zhou, the successors to the Western Wei.    The Xiangtangshan Caves are located not far from the Northern Qi capital at Ye along the road to Jincheng, the seat of the Gao family, a route much traveled by members of the court. Three of the Northern Qi emperors patronized the caves, and Emperor Wenxuan (r. 550\u2013559 ce) is especially remembered for his lavish temple building. In 555, Wenxuan intervened in the competition between Buddhism and Daoism, citing limited government resources as the reason for providing state patronage to only one religion. He organized a debate at which the superiority of each religion was argued; Buddhism prevailed, and an era of temple and pagoda building that glorified the empire and inspired Buddhist converts began.
