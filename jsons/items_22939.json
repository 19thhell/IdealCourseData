Topics include how individual and organizational consumers make decisions, segment markets, estimate the economic value of customers to the firm, position the firm's offering, effective marketing research, new product development and pricing strategies, communicate with consumers, estimate advertising's effectiveness, and manage relationships with sales force and distribution partners. The course also studies how firms must coordinate these different elements of the marketing mix to ensure that all marketing activities collectively forge a coherent strategy. The importance of combining qualitative and quantitative concepts in effective marketing analysis is also examined. The course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, and case analysis. Marketing is a core course and assumes no prior knowledge of marketing. However, there are certain concepts from Firms &amp; Markets that students should have mastered, including: price elasticity of demand, price discrimination, marginal cost, marginal revenue, efficient scale for production capacity, diminishing returns, utility functions and utility curves.             MBA Elective Courses                Globalization of the Entertainment Industry      MKTG-GB.2112 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course provides a framework for understanding the global expansion of media and entertainment companies. It looks into the impact on the U.S. economy due to the significant export growth of American leisure products and services.

The Business of Producing: Entrepreneurship in Entertainment &amp; Media      MKTG-GB.2116 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide students with a framework for understanding the dynamics of producing a finished creative product in the entertainment and media industries. It covers the process of feature production from the initial concept of the story, through script development, to completion of the project. All the facets of the production process are explored, including script selection, finance, budgeting, timetable development, team building, talent selection, contract and union negotiating, regulation, and technology. Guest speakers include producers of independent movies, network TV, cable, syndicated TV, radio, and TV commercials.                         Television Management      MKTG-GB.2118 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide a comprehensive look at the world of marketing in the television industry as it is practiced today and how it will change in the television and advertising fields. It provides a look further into the 21st century and the new age of digital television. Marketing, in this course, encompasses both the marketing of television to the viewer and television advertising time to the advertiser. It also examines the emergence of the Internet and its impact on the television industry today and tomorrow. Emphasis is on the marketing implications of the convergence of the television and the computer, particularly as it pertains to changes in the role of advertising.                         Entertainment and Media Industries      MKTG-GB.2119 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course serves as a foundation for those interested in Stern's Entertainment, Media, and Technology (EMT) program. Students who intend to have a specialization in EMT are required to take this course. It provides a framework for understanding the key marketing, economic, and strategic issues facing organizations in the entertainment industry. Key sectors of the entertainment industry are covered, focusing on film, television, home video, cable, music, publishing, sports, and new media. Lectures and case studies are utilized.                         Movie Marketing and Distribution      MKTG-GB.2120 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course focuses on marketing, distribution, and exhibition of Hollywood and art house movies. It applies business school marketing methodology to the movie industry and provides a rigorous analysis of why movies succeed or fail regardless of their inherent quality. The class covers strategies used by studio executives to track competitors' strengths and weaknesses in the ever-shifting marketplace and how product tie-ins are increasingly used to raise awareness and sell tickets. Students also learn how film executives think when designing movie posters, planning release schedules, casting top actors, setting up co-branded marketing efforts, green lighting scripts, capping production budgets, and attending film festivals. Emerging technologies such as video on demand, satellite distribution, and digital projection are also examined. Class sessions are based on lectures and case studies.                         Financial Services Marketing      MKTG-GB.2121 (1.5 credits)     Corequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course applies the basic principles of marketing management to establish competitive advantage in the saturated financial services market. It explores the marketing activities of well-known financial service enterprises, banks, investment companies, and insurance companies. It also considers the new competitive environment resulting from deregulation and advances in technology and distribution. Furthermore, it examines the marketing strategies of financial institutions and the attendant risks and opportunities associated with their asset allocation decisions using the case study method. Attention is paid to research, planning, strategic decision-making and implementation as the marketing value chain is developed over the life cycle of a financial institution.                         Marketing Strategy for the Service Economy: From Acquisition to Retention      MKTG-GB.2122 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Services differ in many ways from manufactured goods. Their intangibility, inability to be inventoried, and the fact that customers play a greater role in product creation, are but a few examples. As a result, marketers must expand their traditional 4Ps toolset (product, price, place, promotion) to include process, people and the physical environment. Marketers must consequently adjust their application of the 4Ps. For example, pricing techniques such as revenue management may be appropriate to use when a service product is perishable. Promotion needs to be more educational and experiential because the service product is less tangible and there may be greater perceived risk associated with buying it compared to a physical good. Through textbook and case study readings and lectures, plus live and video examples and a service encounter project and presentation, the course objectives are to: 1) Recognize the impetus for services marketing and appreciate the challenges presented by the service sector; 2) Understand concepts and techniques of services marketing (distinguishing from those deployed in goods marketing) and identify appropriate marketing tactics to deploy against specific services marketing problems; 3) Deepen understanding of customer loyalty principles and interventions \u2013 measurement, customer experience design and implementation of customer management programs; and 4) Understand customer loyalty drivers and their impact on growth and profitability.                         Luxury Marketing      MKTG-GB.2126 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of luxury. When was the concept of luxury first articulated and what did it mean within its various manifestations? Who were the luxury consumers in pre-modern cultures and what were the events that catapulted luxury into the sociopolitcal discourse? How did modernity affect ancient processes associated with the production of luxury products? How did the products, consumer tastes, material exchanges, and producer strategies evolve through history? Students will acquire an understanding of the luxury segment of the market as it applies to a variety of industries; observation skills that will allow them to distinguish what constitutes luxury in a product; the necessary vocabulary to articulate the nuances that differentiate these products and the ability to do so with clarity and precision in terms of technique, design, and materials; and finally, the critical skills to identify potential new luxury products and how they relate to a variety of markets, including emerging markets.                         Advanced Luxury Marketing      MKTG-GB.2127 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The luxury industry dates back several centuries and has been one of the fastest growing, most robust sectors in business over the last several decades. The changing consumer, developing markets, changes in media consumption, and emerging technologies all represent tremendous opportunity and challenges for luxury goods. This course aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of the industry and grasp of the technologies and platforms reshaping the business. Specifically we will:     \u2022 Explore the history and evolution of luxury     \u2022 Gain insight into product development and the creative process     \u2022 Better understand the forces re-shaping the industry     \u2022 Develop a robust understanding of the role digital aptitude plays in luxury brands\u2019 future.     This course is especially useful for students who are considering a career in luxury, brand management, consulting, or services focusing on emerging technologies (e.g., Social Media, Search, Online Marketing, e-commerce).                           Consultative Selling      MKTG-GB.2128 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The goal of Consultative Selling is to provide students with the knowledge and skills that entrepreneurs \u2013and nearly all other business executives\u2014need to win customers and grow their business. We will use the consultative selling model to understand the process of selling, discover customer's needs, present solutions, overcome objections, and gain agreement. Rather than pigeonholing selling as \"something done by those sales types,\u201d we look at it as providing solutions to customer's problems. Selling is unique in that everyone does it. In business, we sell our products, proposals, IPOs, projects, budgets, and anything else that someone else has to approve. In life, we buy cars and houses (buying and selling are two sides of the same coin), interview for jobs, propose marriage, and many other things that someone else has to say OK to. In short, selling is a fundamental life skill. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, case discussions, and many small group \"skills drills\" to apply the concepts and methods. In addition to learning the aspects of contemporary selling as it applies to their chosen careers, students will also gain a better appreciation of this important and often misunderstood aspect of an organization. The course is focused on professional, business-to-business (B2B) sales issues and sales management. We frequently draw on our own experiences as consumers (B2C) as a basis for developing perspectives, insights, and understanding of B2B sales themes.                         Sales Management      MKTG-GB.2129 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The goal of Sales Management is to examine the elements of an effective sales force as a key component of the organization's total marketing effort. The course will extend student's understanding of marketing's reach and potential impact in achieving its overarching goals. Course objectives include understanding the sales process, the relationship between sales and marketing, sales force structure, customer relationship management (CRM), use of technology to improve sales force effectiveness, and issues in recruiting, selecting, training, motivating, compensating and retaining salespeople. Students learn to apply the discussion topics through an interactive project worked on throughout the course. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, cases, and multiple opportunities to apply the theories that are discussed (See below for 3 credit version).                         Consultative Sales Plan Development      MKTG-GB.2138 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310 and MKTG-GB.2128              The prerequisite to this course, Consultative Selling (MKTG-GB.2128), examines the consultative selling process and key personal skills within it: relationship building, questioning, platforming, listening, persuasion, and sales negotiations. Consultative Sales Plan Development (MKTG-GB.2138) builds on this by showing how to develop a detailed consultative sales plan designed to penetrate a significant target account. Students will explore the Mapping Process, an approach to thoroughly analyzing a situation and how it is influenced. Students will also look at three applications: Customer Mapping (overarching strategic perspective), Power Mapping (decision-making processes), and Influence Mapping (tactical implementation). The goal of developing a sales plan is to provide students with the knowledge and skills that are needed to win, maintain, and optimize penetration of clients.                         Consumer Neuroscience      MKTG-GB.2146 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Most purchase decisions are unconscious. Behavior, learning, memory, sensation, attention, cognition, perception, emotions and brain activity are concepts that have acquired a new dimension in business and specifically in the context of marketing. This dimension is the main axis of Consumer Neurosciences. The analysis of consumer behavior increasingly gaining importance from the emotional standpoint and it affects any marketing tool that we intend to use, since the advertising and communication, point of sale, image and brand positioning or any other stimulus we present to our potential consumers or buyers. Consumer Neuroscience is an important step in the analysis and understanding of consumer behavior through the rigorous application of the knowledge and techniques of neurosciences, and appears as a new fundamental tool for the present and future of market research. The goals of this class are primarily to acquire knowledge of brain anatomy and functionality (neuroanatomy and neurophysiology) and techniques used to register human brain activity, and learn to apply this knowledge to solve business and marketing questions.                         Social Media      MKTG-GB.2150 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide managers with a framework for understanding and succeeding in the social media space.

The course will help them become familiar with key strategic issues across all the sectors of the mobile industry. Finally, they will develop an understanding and appreciation of the challenges involved in managing mobile products.                         Promotions      MKTG-GB.2152 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Promotions have become the dominant element of the marketing mix, representing 70%+ of the total marketing budget for most consumer brands. Hence, no marketing education is complete without an understanding of this exciting and rapidly growing area. This course covers all major aspects of trade and consumer promotion from strategy through execution, within the framework of how these disciplines fit into the overall marketing plan. Promotion will be covered from a conceptual and \u201creal world\u201d standpoint, using a mix of textbooks, case studies, current articles, and relevant examples.                         Pricing      MKTG-GB.2153 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Pricing is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions.

Marketing Metrics      MKTG-GB.2180 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The marketing metrics in this course fall into three broad categories: capabilities, inputs, and outputs. Capabilities are the strength and resources possessed by an organization. Inputs refer to the effort and budget put into various marketing resources/activities. Outputs refer to the impact of those activities on the customer, product market, and financial market levels. This course focuses on providing you with the tools and approaches to gauge the impact of marketing expenditures. More specifically, you will learn the currently available marketing metrics, determine the most appropriate marketing measures for a company, determine whether data is available or needs to be created, and learn how to construct a marketing measurement system or dashboard to enable return on marketing Investment (ROMI)-driven decisions.

Marketing of Hi-Tech Products      MKTG-GB.2190 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Technological markets, high-technology innovations, and durable products of hi-tech nature are all characterized by growth patterns that are not only different from one market to the next but also contain a high degree of uncertainty. Such chaotic phenomena are difficult to investigate and present a challenge for forecasting market potentials and market shares. In this course we will examine the structure and growth patterns of such markets. We will witness the unbearable slowness of new product growth, understand why main market consumers aren't impressed with early market technophiles, breathlessly watch the bandwagon wheezing by, diligently compute the value of the customers of E*Trade and Ameritrade, and wistfully remember products such as WordPerfect, Lotus 123 and floppy discs.

Judgment &amp; Decision Making      MKTG-GB.2335 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Successful marketing and business strategy depends on a thorough understanding of how people make decisions. Although traditional \u201crational\u201d models of human reasoning make clear predictions about how people should make decisions, these models fail to fully capture how people actually make decisions in the real world. The purpose of this course is to inform future managers and consultants of the sometimes counterintuitive but often predictable rules, processes, and heuristics that guide everyday judgment and decision making, as well as how knowledge of these rules can be utilized to improve marketing and business strategy.                         Consumer Behavior      MKTG-GB.2347 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310      Not open to students who have taken MKTG-GB.2348.              This course studies the consumer as a decision maker. It examines social and psychological influences on purchasing decisions, emphasizing their implications for marketing strategy. Topics include the consumer as a decision maker; motivation attitudes and their effect on behavior, information processing, consumer risk, and demographic, social, and cultural influences on purchasing behavior. Applications to advertising, product, and segmentation strategies as well as Web-based applications of consumer behavior are highlighted.                         Marketing Planning &amp; Strategy      MKTG-GB.2350 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Approximately 95 percent of a brand manager\u2019s responsibilities involve the development, execution, evaluation, and refinement of marketing plans. In this tremendously practical, semester-long course, developed based on best practices at top marketing companies, students are guided through the entire marketing plan process. Teams then apply the learning to create comprehensive plans for \u201creal\u201d brands at \u201creal\u201d companies, in the industry of their choice. The course covers the ins and outs of brand positioning, marketing plan budget setting, pricing strategy development, and volume forecasting. Media plans and ads are created, as well as consumer promotion, trade promotion, direct marketing, Internet marketing and viral/buzz marketing plans.                         Competitive Marketing Strategy      MKTG-GB.2351 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills necessary to develop marketing strategy at the business (in contrast to product) level. Rather than just focusing on creating value propositions for customers, the emphasis in this course will be more strategic: designing value creation and delivery systems. Therefore, the course will target the interface between customer value, marketing decisions, business strategy, and the operations of the organization. The material will be particularly relevant to students who expect to be responsible for developing and/or assessing marketing strategy as owners, employees, and consultants.                         Pricing      MKTG-GB.2353 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Pricing is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions. This course is designed to equip participants with the frameworks, techniques, and latest thinking on assessing and formulating pricing strategies. We will learn the process of making pricing decisions and explore innovative approaches for setting prices. The emphasis of the course is on ways in which you can help firms in diverse industries to improve their pricing. The topics of discussion include pricing of durable goods, pricing of consumer package goods, pricing of service, pricing of informational goods, new product pricing, price promotions, behavior-based pricing, price bundling, nonlinear pricing, targeted pricing, pricing through a distribution channel, and international pricing etc. Upon successful completion of this course, you will (a) gain a solid understanding of pricing practices across different industries, (b) learn state-of-the-art frameworks for analyzing pricing issues, and (c) master the essential techniques for making profitable pricing decisions with strategic thinking.                           Data-Driven Decision Making      MKTG-GB.2354 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.1305              The specific objectives of this course are to: 1. Help you understand how analytical techniques and statistical models can help enhance decision making by converting data to information and insights for decision-making; 2. Provide intuition for data driven decision making by using practical examples from a wide spectrum of fields; 3. Provide insight into how to choose and use the most effective statistical tool based on the problem at hand; 4. Provide you with a software tool kit that will enable you to apply statistical models to real decision problems; 5. Most importantly, remove any fear of data analysis and increase your comfort level with analyzing databases most commonly used in the business world.                           Competitive Strategy in the Marketplace      MKTG-GB.2361 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2103 OR COR1-GB.2301; and COR1-GB.2310. Not open to students who have taken MKTG- GB.2360.              This is a rigorous advanced course in competitive strategy set at the level of the business as it faces competitors at the product market level. The course consists of lectures and formal case presentations recommending strategic actions by student teams to counterpart teams representing senior managers responsible for approving their recommendation. Topics covered include both the process and content of strategic action and interaction, strategic models, brands as a source of competitive advantage, methods for comparing competitive offers and strategies, scenario analysis, competitive signaling, and competitive intelligence.                           Brand Strategy      MKTG-GB.2365 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Brand planners/strategists face many challenges, including how to a) create a comprehensive brand architecture that will provide strategic direction, b) Generate motivating brand identities and value propositions for the key brands, c) develop brand-building programs, and d) leverage new technologies. The goal of this course is to provide concepts, models, methods, and role models that will help address these challenges.                         New Product Development      MKTG-GB.2370 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              New products and services are vital to the success of all companies. Innovation is risky, however, and most new products fail in the marketplace. Thus, expertise in the design and marketing of new products is a critical skill for all managers, inside and outside of the marketing department. There is a focus on the tools and techniques associated with analyzing market opportunities and then designing, testing, and introducing new products and services. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are covered. In particular, the course covers the new product development process, market entry strategies, how to generate new product ideas, mapping customer perceptions, segmentation, product positioning, forecasting market demand, product design, and advertising and product testing. The course emphasizes how to incorporate customers and competitors into all of these aspects of new product development. In contrast, a related course (B60.3356, Technological Innovation &amp; New Product Development) emphasizes organizational issues associated with new product development.                         Innovation and Design      MKTG-GB.2371 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Many firms that have experienced dramatic gains in shareholder value over the last few years (e.g., Google, Apple, Motorola) register innovation as a central driver of their progress. One can argue that innovation, and a culture that inspires and supports innovation, is the only sustainable competitive advantage. A frequent manifestation of recent innovation has been breakthrough design. Design represents a powerful alternative to the dominant management approaches of the last few decades and is an important perspective for leadership to embrace.                         Retail Strategy      MKTG-GB.2375 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Virtually every major consumer brand is sold through a variety of retail channels. The store is where brand and consumer \u201cmeet\u201d and the purchase decision is made. In the last twenty-five years, a variety of trends have converged to create a situation today in which major retailers are arguably the dominant influence on a brand's success. The bottom line: consumers are getting harder and harder to reach and influence, and they make 70% of their brand purchase decisions in-store. Retail Marketing has emerged as a key element of the marketing mix. This course will provide students with a solid understanding of the retail landscape, covering all key classes of trade. That understanding of the key retail channels will be integrated with an in-depth review of effective marketing strategies for each channel. We will also explore how the retail marketing elements are integrated into the overall marketing framework for the brand. Text and case studies will be used, as well as current literature. Numerous industry experts, from both the retail and consumer goods world, will be utilized as class speakers.                         Creativity      MKTG-GB.2381 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Successful business people approach their problems creatively and happy people live their lives as works of art. In this course we explore the many dimensions of creativity that are important in business and in our own lives. Creativity isn\u2019t a mystical quality with which only a few are blessed. Practical methods to become more flexible, imaginative, and productive thinkers can be learned by anyone, nurtured in others, and harnessed to create new products, uses, designs, theories, strategies, structures, and other solutions of all kinds. We will define creativity, review the science, and develop our own creative skill set by learning about, experiencing, and experimenting with a wide variety of approaches.                         Global Marketing Strategy      MKTG-GB.2385 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course examines the development of international marketing programs, from determining objectives and evaluating international market opportunities to coordinating strategies in world markets. It differentiates between global and multi-national approaches to all elements of the marketing mix. There is an emphasis in the application of marketing principles in the multinational environment and the cultural influences that require adaptation of strategies in diverse markets.                         Corporate Branding and CSR      MKTG-GB.3101 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course provides a theoretical and strategic overview of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the context of corporate branding. The theory of the course proceeds from: i) the corporate need to protect long-term investments in corporate brand image, ii) the emergence of large segments of affluent, ethically sensitive consumers, and iii) the incompleteness of law and regulation, especially in global markets. The practical and strategic content of the course is derived from a number of cases with guest participants drawn from corporations, NGO, and investment management firms. This course should be of interest to Marketing majors and all NYU students seeking to better understand the politics, strategy, and implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility.

Topics include how individual and organizational consumers make decisions, segment markets, estimate the economic value of customers to the firm, position the firm's offering, effective marketing research, new product development and pricing strategies, communicate with consumers, estimate advertising's effectiveness, and manage relationships with sales force and distribution partners. The course also studies how firms must coordinate these different elements of the marketing mix to ensure that all marketing activities collectively forge a coherent strategy. The importance of combining qualitative and quantitative concepts in effective marketing analysis is also examined. The course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, and case analysis. Marketing is a core course and assumes no prior knowledge of marketing. However, there are certain concepts from Firms &amp; Markets that students should have mastered, including: price elasticity of demand, price discrimination, marginal cost, marginal revenue, efficient scale for production capacity, diminishing returns, utility functions and utility curves.             MBA Elective Courses                Globalization of the Entertainment Industry      MKTG-GB.2112 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course provides a framework for understanding the global expansion of media and entertainment companies. It looks into the impact on the U.S. economy due to the significant export growth of American leisure products and services. Students are prepared through the analysis of several leading entertainment and media multinational companies, and the development of their businesses within the major world economic zones. International speakers, special cases, and readings are included.                         The Business of Sports Marketing      MTKG-GB.2114 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The business of sports has become a persistent and integral part of our economy, specifically in the multi-media and entertainment arena. This is a specialized course for the MBA student interested in expanding knowledge of the sports industry as a business and as a world economic force. It provides students with a framework for understanding the scope of the sports business across various leagues, venues, athletes and their relationship to internal and external factors, infrastructures, professional-support systems and the marketing applications that drive this complex and growing multibillion dollar industry.                         The Business of Producing: Entrepreneurship in Entertainment &amp; Media      MKTG-GB.2116 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide students with a framework for understanding the dynamics of producing a finished creative product in the entertainment and media industries. It covers the process of feature production from the initial concept of the story, through script development, to completion of the project. All the facets of the production process are explored, including script selection, finance, budgeting, timetable development, team building, talent selection, contract and union negotiating, regulation, and technology. Guest speakers include producers of independent movies, network TV, cable, syndicated TV, radio, and TV commercials.                         Television Management      MKTG-GB.2118 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide a comprehensive look at the world of marketing in the television industry as it is practiced today and how it will change in the television and advertising fields. It provides a look further into the 21st century and the new age of digital television. Marketing, in this course, encompasses both the marketing of television to the viewer and television advertising time to the advertiser. It also examines the emergence of the Internet and its impact on the television industry today and tomorrow. Emphasis is on the marketing implications of the convergence of the television and the computer, particularly as it pertains to changes in the role of advertising.                         Entertainment and Media Industries      MKTG-GB.2119 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course serves as a foundation for those interested in Stern's Entertainment, Media, and Technology (EMT) program. Students who intend to have a specialization in EMT are required to take this course. It provides a framework for understanding the key marketing, economic, and strategic issues facing organizations in the entertainment industry. Key sectors of the entertainment industry are covered, focusing on film, television, home video, cable, music, publishing, sports, and new media. Lectures and case studies are utilized.                         Movie Marketing and Distribution      MKTG-GB.2120 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course focuses on marketing, distribution, and exhibition of Hollywood and art house movies. It applies business school marketing methodology to the movie industry and provides a rigorous analysis of why movies succeed or fail regardless of their inherent quality. The class covers strategies used by studio executives to track competitors' strengths and weaknesses in the ever-shifting marketplace and how product tie-ins are increasingly used to raise awareness and sell tickets. Students also learn how film executives think when designing movie posters, planning release schedules, casting top actors, setting up co-branded marketing efforts, green lighting scripts, capping production budgets, and attending film festivals. Emerging technologies such as video on demand, satellite distribution, and digital projection are also examined. Class sessions are based on lectures and case studies.                         Financial Services Marketing      MKTG-GB.2121 (1.5 credits)     Corequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course applies the basic principles of marketing management to establish competitive advantage in the saturated financial services market. It explores the marketing activities of well-known financial service enterprises, banks, investment companies, and insurance companies. It also considers the new competitive environment resulting from deregulation and advances in technology and distribution. Furthermore, it examines the marketing strategies of financial institutions and the attendant risks and opportunities associated with their asset allocation decisions using the case study method. Attention is paid to research, planning, strategic decision-making and implementation as the marketing value chain is developed over the life cycle of a financial institution.                         Marketing Strategy for the Service Economy: From Acquisition to Retention      MKTG-GB.2122 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Services differ in many ways from manufactured goods. Their intangibility, inability to be inventoried, and the fact that customers play a greater role in product creation, are but a few examples. As a result, marketers must expand their traditional 4Ps toolset (product, price, place, promotion) to include process, people and the physical environment. Marketers must consequently adjust their application of the 4Ps. For example, pricing techniques such as revenue management may be appropriate to use when a service product is perishable. Promotion needs to be more educational and experiential because the service product is less tangible and there may be greater perceived risk associated with buying it compared to a physical good. Through textbook and case study readings and lectures, plus live and video examples and a service encounter project and presentation, the course objectives are to: 1) Recognize the impetus for services marketing and appreciate the challenges presented by the service sector; 2) Understand concepts and techniques of services marketing (distinguishing from those deployed in goods marketing) and identify appropriate marketing tactics to deploy against specific services marketing problems; 3) Deepen understanding of customer loyalty principles and interventions \u2013 measurement, customer experience design and implementation of customer management programs; and 4) Understand customer loyalty drivers and their impact on growth and profitability.                         Luxury Marketing      MKTG-GB.2126 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of luxury. When was the concept of luxury first articulated and what did it mean within its various manifestations? Who were the luxury consumers in pre-modern cultures and what were the events that catapulted luxury into the sociopolitcal discourse? How did modernity affect ancient processes associated with the production of luxury products? How did the products, consumer tastes, material exchanges, and producer strategies evolve through history? Students will acquire an understanding of the luxury segment of the market as it applies to a variety of industries; observation skills that will allow them to distinguish what constitutes luxury in a product; the necessary vocabulary to articulate the nuances that differentiate these products and the ability to do so with clarity and precision in terms of technique, design, and materials; and finally, the critical skills to identify potential new luxury products and how they relate to a variety of markets, including emerging markets.                         Advanced Luxury Marketing      MKTG-GB.2127 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The luxury industry dates back several centuries and has been one of the fastest growing, most robust sectors in business over the last several decades. The changing consumer, developing markets, changes in media consumption, and emerging technologies all represent tremendous opportunity and challenges for luxury goods. This course aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of the industry and grasp of the technologies and platforms reshaping the business.

Consultative Selling      MKTG-GB.2128 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The goal of Consultative Selling is to provide students with the knowledge and skills that entrepreneurs \u2013and nearly all other business executives\u2014need to win customers and grow their business. We will use the consultative selling model to understand the process of selling, discover customer's needs, present solutions, overcome objections, and gain agreement. Rather than pigeonholing selling as \"something done by those sales types,\u201d we look at it as providing solutions to customer's problems. Selling is unique in that everyone does it. In business, we sell our products, proposals, IPOs, projects, budgets, and anything else that someone else has to approve. In life, we buy cars and houses (buying and selling are two sides of the same coin), interview for jobs, propose marriage, and many other things that someone else has to say OK to. In short, selling is a fundamental life skill. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, case discussions, and many small group \"skills drills\" to apply the concepts and methods. In addition to learning the aspects of contemporary selling as it applies to their chosen careers, students will also gain a better appreciation of this important and often misunderstood aspect of an organization. The course is focused on professional, business-to-business (B2B) sales issues and sales management. We frequently draw on our own experiences as consumers (B2C) as a basis for developing perspectives, insights, and understanding of B2B sales themes.                         Sales Management      MKTG-GB.2129 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The goal of Sales Management is to examine the elements of an effective sales force as a key component of the organization's total marketing effort.

Students learn to apply the discussion topics through an interactive project worked on throughout the course. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, cases, and multiple opportunities to apply the theories that are discussed (See below for 3 credit version).                         Consultative Sales Plan Development      MKTG-GB.2138 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310 and MKTG-GB.2128              The prerequisite to this course, Consultative Selling (MKTG-GB.2128), examines the consultative selling process and key personal skills within it: relationship building, questioning, platforming, listening, persuasion, and sales negotiations. Consultative Sales Plan Development (MKTG-GB.2138) builds on this by showing how to develop a detailed consultative sales plan designed to penetrate a significant target account. Students will explore the Mapping Process, an approach to thoroughly analyzing a situation and how it is influenced. Students will also look at three applications: Customer Mapping (overarching strategic perspective), Power Mapping (decision-making processes), and Influence Mapping (tactical implementation). The goal of developing a sales plan is to provide students with the knowledge and skills that are needed to win, maintain, and optimize penetration of clients.                         Consumer Neuroscience      MKTG-GB.2146 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Most purchase decisions are unconscious. Behavior, learning, memory, sensation, attention, cognition, perception, emotions and brain activity are concepts that have acquired a new dimension in business and specifically in the context of marketing. This dimension is the main axis of Consumer Neurosciences. The analysis of consumer behavior increasingly gaining importance from the emotional standpoint and it affects any marketing tool that we intend to use, since the advertising and communication, point of sale, image and brand positioning or any other stimulus we present to our potential consumers or buyers. Consumer Neuroscience is an important step in the analysis and understanding of consumer behavior through the rigorous application of the knowledge and techniques of neurosciences, and appears as a new fundamental tool for the present and future of market research. The goals of this class are primarily to acquire knowledge of brain anatomy and functionality (neuroanatomy and neurophysiology) and techniques used to register human brain activity, and learn to apply this knowledge to solve business and marketing questions.

Promotions      MKTG-GB.2152 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Promotions have become the dominant element of the marketing mix, representing 70%+ of the total marketing budget for most consumer brands. Hence, no marketing education is complete without an understanding of this exciting and rapidly growing area. This course covers all major aspects of trade and consumer promotion from strategy through execution, within the framework of how these disciplines fit into the overall marketing plan.

Marketing Metrics      MKTG-GB.2180 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The marketing metrics in this course fall into three broad categories: capabilities, inputs, and outputs. Capabilities are the strength and resources possessed by an organization. Inputs refer to the effort and budget put into various marketing resources/activities. Outputs refer to the impact of those activities on the customer, product market, and financial market levels. This course focuses on providing you with the tools and approaches to gauge the impact of marketing expenditures. More specifically, you will learn the currently available marketing metrics, determine the most appropriate marketing measures for a company, determine whether data is available or needs to be created, and learn how to construct a marketing measurement system or dashboard to enable return on marketing Investment (ROMI)-driven decisions. At the conclusion of this course you will be better able to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing spending/value investing.                         Marketing of Hi-Tech Products      MKTG-GB.2190 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Technological markets, high-technology innovations, and durable products of hi-tech nature are all characterized by growth patterns that are not only different from one market to the next but also contain a high degree of uncertainty. Such chaotic phenomena are difficult to investigate and present a challenge for forecasting market potentials and market shares. In this course we will examine the structure and growth patterns of such markets. We will witness the unbearable slowness of new product growth, understand why main market consumers aren't impressed with early market technophiles, breathlessly watch the bandwagon wheezing by, diligently compute the value of the customers of E*Trade and Ameritrade, and wistfully remember products such as WordPerfect, Lotus 123 and floppy discs.                         Tech Product Management      MKTG-GB.2191 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide you with a framework for understanding product management for technology products within a range of organizations large and small. The course covers tangible tools, techniques, best practices and real world simulation of what a product manager faces in trying to deliver against product, company and user objectives.                         Advertising      MKTG-GB.2309 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course develops a framework for managing the advertising function within the larger context of integrated marketing communications. It surveys brand positioning and all the marketing communications tools, particularly advertising, which are essential to creating and maintaining a brand identity.

Research for Customer Insights      MKTG-GB.2327 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310 and COR1-GB.1305              This course emphasizes the organization, processes, and applications of marketing research in making business decisions.

Judgment &amp; Decision Making      MKTG-GB.2335 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Successful marketing and business strategy depends on a thorough understanding of how people make decisions. Although traditional \u201crational\u201d models of human reasoning make clear predictions about how people should make decisions, these models fail to fully capture how people actually make decisions in the real world. The purpose of this course is to inform future managers and consultants of the sometimes counterintuitive but often predictable rules, processes, and heuristics that guide everyday judgment and decision making, as well as how knowledge of these rules can be utilized to improve marketing and business strategy.                         Consumer Behavior      MKTG-GB.2347 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310      Not open to students who have taken MKTG-GB.2348.              This course studies the consumer as a decision maker. It examines social and psychological influences on purchasing decisions, emphasizing their implications for marketing strategy. Topics include the consumer as a decision maker; motivation attitudes and their effect on behavior, information processing, consumer risk, and demographic, social, and cultural influences on purchasing behavior. Applications to advertising, product, and segmentation strategies as well as Web-based applications of consumer behavior are highlighted.                         Marketing Planning &amp; Strategy      MKTG-GB.2350 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Approximately 95 percent of a brand manager\u2019s responsibilities involve the development, execution, evaluation, and refinement of marketing plans. In this tremendously practical, semester-long course, developed based on best practices at top marketing companies, students are guided through the entire marketing plan process. Teams then apply the learning to create comprehensive plans for \u201creal\u201d brands at \u201creal\u201d companies, in the industry of their choice. The course covers the ins and outs of brand positioning, marketing plan budget setting, pricing strategy development, and volume forecasting. Media plans and ads are created, as well as consumer promotion, trade promotion, direct marketing, Internet marketing and viral/buzz marketing plans.                         Competitive Marketing Strategy      MKTG-GB.2351 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills necessary to develop marketing strategy at the business (in contrast to product) level. Rather than just focusing on creating value propositions for customers, the emphasis in this course will be more strategic: designing value creation and delivery systems. Therefore, the course will target the interface between customer value, marketing decisions, business strategy, and the operations of the organization. The material will be particularly relevant to students who expect to be responsible for developing and/or assessing marketing strategy as owners, employees, and consultants.                         Pricing      MKTG-GB.2353 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Pricing is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions. This course is designed to equip participants with the frameworks, techniques, and latest thinking on assessing and formulating pricing strategies. We will learn the process of making pricing decisions and explore innovative approaches for setting prices. The emphasis of the course is on ways in which you can help firms in diverse industries to improve their pricing. The topics of discussion include pricing of durable goods, pricing of consumer package goods, pricing of service, pricing of informational goods, new product pricing, price promotions, behavior-based pricing, price bundling, nonlinear pricing, targeted pricing, pricing through a distribution channel, and international pricing etc. Upon successful completion of this course, you will (a) gain a solid understanding of pricing practices across different industries, (b) learn state-of-the-art frameworks for analyzing pricing issues, and (c) master the essential techniques for making profitable pricing decisions with strategic thinking.                           Data-Driven Decision Making      MKTG-GB.2354 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.1305              The specific objectives of this course are to: 1. Help you understand how analytical techniques and statistical models can help enhance decision making by converting data to information and insights for decision-making; 2.

Competitive Strategy in the Marketplace      MKTG-GB.2361 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2103 OR COR1-GB.2301; and COR1-GB.2310. Not open to students who have taken MKTG- GB.2360.              This is a rigorous advanced course in competitive strategy set at the level of the business as it faces competitors at the product market level. The course consists of lectures and formal case presentations recommending strategic actions by student teams to counterpart teams representing senior managers responsible for approving their recommendation. Topics covered include both the process and content of strategic action and interaction, strategic models, brands as a source of competitive advantage, methods for comparing competitive offers and strategies, scenario analysis, competitive signaling, and competitive intelligence.                           Brand Strategy      MKTG-GB.2365 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Brand planners/strategists face many challenges, including how to a) create a comprehensive brand architecture that will provide strategic direction, b) Generate motivating brand identities and value propositions for the key brands, c) develop brand-building programs, and d) leverage new technologies. The goal of this course is to provide concepts, models, methods, and role models that will help address these challenges.                         New Product Development      MKTG-GB.2370 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              New products and services are vital to the success of all companies. Innovation is risky, however, and most new products fail in the marketplace. Thus, expertise in the design and marketing of new products is a critical skill for all managers, inside and outside of the marketing department. There is a focus on the tools and techniques associated with analyzing market opportunities and then designing, testing, and introducing new products and services. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are covered. In particular, the course covers the new product development process, market entry strategies, how to generate new product ideas, mapping customer perceptions, segmentation, product positioning, forecasting market demand, product design, and advertising and product testing. The course emphasizes how to incorporate customers and competitors into all of these aspects of new product development. In contrast, a related course (B60.3356, Technological Innovation &amp; New Product Development) emphasizes organizational issues associated with new product development.                         Innovation and Design      MKTG-GB.2371 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Many firms that have experienced dramatic gains in shareholder value over the last few years (e.g., Google, Apple, Motorola) register innovation as a central driver of their progress. One can argue that innovation, and a culture that inspires and supports innovation, is the only sustainable competitive advantage. A frequent manifestation of recent innovation has been breakthrough design. Design represents a powerful alternative to the dominant management approaches of the last few decades and is an important perspective for leadership to embrace.                         Retail Strategy      MKTG-GB.2375 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Virtually every major consumer brand is sold through a variety of retail channels. The store is where brand and consumer \u201cmeet\u201d and the purchase decision is made. In the last twenty-five years, a variety of trends have converged to create a situation today in which major retailers are arguably the dominant influence on a brand's success. The bottom line: consumers are getting harder and harder to reach and influence, and they make 70% of their brand purchase decisions in-store. Retail Marketing has emerged as a key element of the marketing mix. This course will provide students with a solid understanding of the retail landscape, covering all key classes of trade. That understanding of the key retail channels will be integrated with an in-depth review of effective marketing strategies for each channel. We will also explore how the retail marketing elements are integrated into the overall marketing framework for the brand. Text and case studies will be used, as well as current literature. Numerous industry experts, from both the retail and consumer goods world, will be utilized as class speakers.                         Creativity      MKTG-GB.2381 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Successful business people approach their problems creatively and happy people live their lives as works of art. In this course we explore the many dimensions of creativity that are important in business and in our own lives. Creativity isn\u2019t a mystical quality with which only a few are blessed. Practical methods to become more flexible, imaginative, and productive thinkers can be learned by anyone, nurtured in others, and harnessed to create new products, uses, designs, theories, strategies, structures, and other solutions of all kinds. We will define creativity, review the science, and develop our own creative skill set by learning about, experiencing, and experimenting with a wide variety of approaches.                         Global Marketing Strategy      MKTG-GB.2385 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course examines the development of international marketing programs, from determining objectives and evaluating international market opportunities to coordinating strategies in world markets. It differentiates between global and multi-national approaches to all elements of the marketing mix. There is an emphasis in the application of marketing principles in the multinational environment and the cultural influences that require adaptation of strategies in diverse markets.                         Corporate Branding and CSR      MKTG-GB.3101 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course provides a theoretical and strategic overview of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the context of corporate branding. The theory of the course proceeds from: i) the corporate need to protect long-term investments in corporate brand image, ii) the emergence of large segments of affluent, ethically sensitive consumers, and iii) the incompleteness of law and regulation, especially in global markets. The practical and strategic content of the course is derived from a number of cases with guest participants drawn from corporations, NGO, and investment management firms.

Topics include how individual and organizational consumers make decisions, segment markets, estimate the economic value of customers to the firm, position the firm's offering, effective marketing research, new product development and pricing strategies, communicate with consumers, estimate advertising's effectiveness, and manage relationships with sales force and distribution partners. The course also studies how firms must coordinate these different elements of the marketing mix to ensure that all marketing activities collectively forge a coherent strategy. The importance of combining qualitative and quantitative concepts in effective marketing analysis is also examined. The course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, and case analysis. Marketing is a core course and assumes no prior knowledge of marketing. However, there are certain concepts from Firms &amp; Markets that students should have mastered, including: price elasticity of demand, price discrimination, marginal cost, marginal revenue, efficient scale for production capacity, diminishing returns, utility functions and utility curves.             MBA Elective Courses                Globalization of the Entertainment Industry      MKTG-GB.2112 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course provides a framework for understanding the global expansion of media and entertainment companies. It looks into the impact on the U.S. economy due to the significant export growth of American leisure products and services. Students are prepared through the analysis of several leading entertainment and media multinational companies, and the development of their businesses within the major world economic zones. International speakers, special cases, and readings are included.                         The Business of Sports Marketing      MTKG-GB.2114 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The business of sports has become a persistent and integral part of our economy, specifically in the multi-media and entertainment arena. This is a specialized course for the MBA student interested in expanding knowledge of the sports industry as a business and as a world economic force. It provides students with a framework for understanding the scope of the sports business across various leagues, venues, athletes and their relationship to internal and external factors, infrastructures, professional-support systems and the marketing applications that drive this complex and growing multibillion dollar industry.                         The Business of Producing: Entrepreneurship in Entertainment &amp; Media      MKTG-GB.2116 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide students with a framework for understanding the dynamics of producing a finished creative product in the entertainment and media industries. It covers the process of feature production from the initial concept of the story, through script development, to completion of the project. All the facets of the production process are explored, including script selection, finance, budgeting, timetable development, team building, talent selection, contract and union negotiating, regulation, and technology. Guest speakers include producers of independent movies, network TV, cable, syndicated TV, radio, and TV commercials.                         Television Management      MKTG-GB.2118 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide a comprehensive look at the world of marketing in the television industry as it is practiced today and how it will change in the television and advertising fields. It provides a look further into the 21st century and the new age of digital television. Marketing, in this course, encompasses both the marketing of television to the viewer and television advertising time to the advertiser. It also examines the emergence of the Internet and its impact on the television industry today and tomorrow. Emphasis is on the marketing implications of the convergence of the television and the computer, particularly as it pertains to changes in the role of advertising.                         Entertainment and Media Industries      MKTG-GB.2119 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course serves as a foundation for those interested in Stern's Entertainment, Media, and Technology (EMT) program. Students who intend to have a specialization in EMT are required to take this course. It provides a framework for understanding the key marketing, economic, and strategic issues facing organizations in the entertainment industry. Key sectors of the entertainment industry are covered, focusing on film, television, home video, cable, music, publishing, sports, and new media. Lectures and case studies are utilized.                         Movie Marketing and Distribution      MKTG-GB.2120 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course focuses on marketing, distribution, and exhibition of Hollywood and art house movies. It applies business school marketing methodology to the movie industry and provides a rigorous analysis of why movies succeed or fail regardless of their inherent quality. The class covers strategies used by studio executives to track competitors' strengths and weaknesses in the ever-shifting marketplace and how product tie-ins are increasingly used to raise awareness and sell tickets. Students also learn how film executives think when designing movie posters, planning release schedules, casting top actors, setting up co-branded marketing efforts, green lighting scripts, capping production budgets, and attending film festivals. Emerging technologies such as video on demand, satellite distribution, and digital projection are also examined. Class sessions are based on lectures and case studies.                         Financial Services Marketing      MKTG-GB.2121 (1.5 credits)     Corequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course applies the basic principles of marketing management to establish competitive advantage in the saturated financial services market. It explores the marketing activities of well-known financial service enterprises, banks, investment companies, and insurance companies. It also considers the new competitive environment resulting from deregulation and advances in technology and distribution. Furthermore, it examines the marketing strategies of financial institutions and the attendant risks and opportunities associated with their asset allocation decisions using the case study method. Attention is paid to research, planning, strategic decision-making and implementation as the marketing value chain is developed over the life cycle of a financial institution.                         Marketing Strategy for the Service Economy: From Acquisition to Retention      MKTG-GB.2122 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Services differ in many ways from manufactured goods. Their intangibility, inability to be inventoried, and the fact that customers play a greater role in product creation, are but a few examples. As a result, marketers must expand their traditional 4Ps toolset (product, price, place, promotion) to include process, people and the physical environment. Marketers must consequently adjust their application of the 4Ps. For example, pricing techniques such as revenue management may be appropriate to use when a service product is perishable. Promotion needs to be more educational and experiential because the service product is less tangible and there may be greater perceived risk associated with buying it compared to a physical good. Through textbook and case study readings and lectures, plus live and video examples and a service encounter project and presentation, the course objectives are to: 1) Recognize the impetus for services marketing and appreciate the challenges presented by the service sector; 2) Understand concepts and techniques of services marketing (distinguishing from those deployed in goods marketing) and identify appropriate marketing tactics to deploy against specific services marketing problems; 3) Deepen understanding of customer loyalty principles and interventions \u2013 measurement, customer experience design and implementation of customer management programs; and 4) Understand customer loyalty drivers and their impact on growth and profitability.                         Luxury Marketing      MKTG-GB.2126 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The course is designed to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of luxury. When was the concept of luxury first articulated and what did it mean within its various manifestations? Who were the luxury consumers in pre-modern cultures and what were the events that catapulted luxury into the sociopolitcal discourse? How did modernity affect ancient processes associated with the production of luxury products? How did the products, consumer tastes, material exchanges, and producer strategies evolve through history? Students will acquire an understanding of the luxury segment of the market as it applies to a variety of industries; observation skills that will allow them to distinguish what constitutes luxury in a product; the necessary vocabulary to articulate the nuances that differentiate these products and the ability to do so with clarity and precision in terms of technique, design, and materials; and finally, the critical skills to identify potential new luxury products and how they relate to a variety of markets, including emerging markets.                         Advanced Luxury Marketing      MKTG-GB.2127 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The luxury industry dates back several centuries and has been one of the fastest growing, most robust sectors in business over the last several decades. The changing consumer, developing markets, changes in media consumption, and emerging technologies all represent tremendous opportunity and challenges for luxury goods. This course aims to provide students with a deeper understanding of the industry and grasp of the technologies and platforms reshaping the business. Specifically we will:     \u2022 Explore the history and evolution of luxury     \u2022 Gain insight into product development and the creative process     \u2022 Better understand the forces re-shaping the industry     \u2022 Develop a robust understanding of the role digital aptitude plays in luxury brands\u2019 future.     This course is especially useful for students who are considering a career in luxury, brand management, consulting, or services focusing on emerging technologies (e.g., Social Media, Search, Online Marketing, e-commerce).                           Consultative Selling      MKTG-GB.2128 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The goal of Consultative Selling is to provide students with the knowledge and skills that entrepreneurs \u2013and nearly all other business executives\u2014need to win customers and grow their business. We will use the consultative selling model to understand the process of selling, discover customer's needs, present solutions, overcome objections, and gain agreement. Rather than pigeonholing selling as \"something done by those sales types,\u201d we look at it as providing solutions to customer's problems. Selling is unique in that everyone does it. In business, we sell our products, proposals, IPOs, projects, budgets, and anything else that someone else has to approve. In life, we buy cars and houses (buying and selling are two sides of the same coin), interview for jobs, propose marriage, and many other things that someone else has to say OK to. In short, selling is a fundamental life skill. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, case discussions, and many small group \"skills drills\" to apply the concepts and methods. In addition to learning the aspects of contemporary selling as it applies to their chosen careers, students will also gain a better appreciation of this important and often misunderstood aspect of an organization. The course is focused on professional, business-to-business (B2B) sales issues and sales management. We frequently draw on our own experiences as consumers (B2C) as a basis for developing perspectives, insights, and understanding of B2B sales themes.                         Sales Management      MKTG-GB.2129 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The goal of Sales Management is to examine the elements of an effective sales force as a key component of the organization's total marketing effort. The course will extend student's understanding of marketing's reach and potential impact in achieving its overarching goals. Course objectives include understanding the sales process, the relationship between sales and marketing, sales force structure, customer relationship management (CRM), use of technology to improve sales force effectiveness, and issues in recruiting, selecting, training, motivating, compensating and retaining salespeople. Students learn to apply the discussion topics through an interactive project worked on throughout the course. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, cases, and multiple opportunities to apply the theories that are discussed (See below for 3 credit version).                         Consultative Sales Plan Development      MKTG-GB.2138 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310 and MKTG-GB.2128              The prerequisite to this course, Consultative Selling (MKTG-GB.2128), examines the consultative selling process and key personal skills within it: relationship building, questioning, platforming, listening, persuasion, and sales negotiations. Consultative Sales Plan Development (MKTG-GB.2138) builds on this by showing how to develop a detailed consultative sales plan designed to penetrate a significant target account. Students will explore the Mapping Process, an approach to thoroughly analyzing a situation and how it is influenced. Students will also look at three applications: Customer Mapping (overarching strategic perspective), Power Mapping (decision-making processes), and Influence Mapping (tactical implementation). The goal of developing a sales plan is to provide students with the knowledge and skills that are needed to win, maintain, and optimize penetration of clients.                         Consumer Neuroscience      MKTG-GB.2146 (1.5 credits)      Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Most purchase decisions are unconscious. Behavior, learning, memory, sensation, attention, cognition, perception, emotions and brain activity are concepts that have acquired a new dimension in business and specifically in the context of marketing. This dimension is the main axis of Consumer Neurosciences. The analysis of consumer behavior increasingly gaining importance from the emotional standpoint and it affects any marketing tool that we intend to use, since the advertising and communication, point of sale, image and brand positioning or any other stimulus we present to our potential consumers or buyers. Consumer Neuroscience is an important step in the analysis and understanding of consumer behavior through the rigorous application of the knowledge and techniques of neurosciences, and appears as a new fundamental tool for the present and future of market research. The goals of this class are primarily to acquire knowledge of brain anatomy and functionality (neuroanatomy and neurophysiology) and techniques used to register human brain activity, and learn to apply this knowledge to solve business and marketing questions.                         Social Media      MKTG-GB.2150 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide managers with a framework for understanding and succeeding in the social media space.

Marketing Metrics      MKTG-GB.2180 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              The marketing metrics in this course fall into three broad categories: capabilities, inputs, and outputs. Capabilities are the strength and resources possessed by an organization. Inputs refer to the effort and budget put into various marketing resources/activities. Outputs refer to the impact of those activities on the customer, product market, and financial market levels. This course focuses on providing you with the tools and approaches to gauge the impact of marketing expenditures. More specifically, you will learn the currently available marketing metrics, determine the most appropriate marketing measures for a company, determine whether data is available or needs to be created, and learn how to construct a marketing measurement system or dashboard to enable return on marketing Investment (ROMI)-driven decisions.

Marketing of Hi-Tech Products      MKTG-GB.2190 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Technological markets, high-technology innovations, and durable products of hi-tech nature are all characterized by growth patterns that are not only different from one market to the next but also contain a high degree of uncertainty. Such chaotic phenomena are difficult to investigate and present a challenge for forecasting market potentials and market shares. In this course we will examine the structure and growth patterns of such markets. We will witness the unbearable slowness of new product growth, understand why main market consumers aren't impressed with early market technophiles, breathlessly watch the bandwagon wheezing by, diligently compute the value of the customers of E*Trade and Ameritrade, and wistfully remember products such as WordPerfect, Lotus 123 and floppy discs.                         Tech Product Management      MKTG-GB.2191 (1.5 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide you with a framework for understanding product management for technology products within a range of organizations large and small. The course covers tangible tools, techniques, best practices and real world simulation of what a product manager faces in trying to deliver against product, company and user objectives.                         Advertising      MKTG-GB.2309 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course develops a framework for managing the advertising function within the larger context of integrated marketing communications. It surveys brand positioning and all the marketing communications tools, particularly advertising, which are essential to creating and maintaining a brand identity. Also covered: identifying target markets, establishing advertising objectives and strategies, budgeting, media planning and evaluation of advertising effectiveness.                           Craft and Commerce of Cinema: Cannes Film Festival      MKTG-GB.2313 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: MKTG-GB.2341, COR1-GB.2310      By application only              This is a specialized EMT course designed to provide students with a framework for understanding the dynamics of the film industry including the complete process from crafting the idea for a film script, hiring or becoming a producer, financing the project, selling it to a studio or independent production company, building a team, production elements, post production including music acquisition, marketing, distribution and exhibition, international, and domestic. The course includes learning about distribution and exhibition, marketing and building audience awareness, research applications, international licensing, and preparation for career in the industry. It is offered during spring break and involves a trip to the west coast. In addition to tuition, students have to pay travel and living expenses.                           Digital Media Innovation      MKTG-GB.2325 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to provide you with an orientation to the best current digital marketing practices. We will examine the inner workings of some of the most interesting and fastest growing digital companies and meet some of the leaders of these companies for a first hand view of how digital marketing is evolving and progressing.

Research for Customer Insights      MKTG-GB.2327 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310 and COR1-GB.1305              This course emphasizes the organization, processes, and applications of marketing research in making business decisions. Topics include steps in marketing research, questionnaire construction, experimental design, sampling methods, tests of hypotheses, data analysis, evaluation of research costs to results achieved, and applications of research to marketing decision areas. It requires a research project involving data collection and analysis.                         Judgment &amp; Decision Making      MKTG-GB.2335 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Successful marketing and business strategy depends on a thorough understanding of how people make decisions. Although traditional \u201crational\u201d models of human reasoning make clear predictions about how people should make decisions, these models fail to fully capture how people actually make decisions in the real world. The purpose of this course is to inform future managers and consultants of the sometimes counterintuitive but often predictable rules, processes, and heuristics that guide everyday judgment and decision making, as well as how knowledge of these rules can be utilized to improve marketing and business strategy.                         Consumer Behavior      MKTG-GB.2347 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310      Not open to students who have taken MKTG-GB.2348.              This course studies the consumer as a decision maker. It examines social and psychological influences on purchasing decisions, emphasizing their implications for marketing strategy. Topics include the consumer as a decision maker; motivation attitudes and their effect on behavior, information processing, consumer risk, and demographic, social, and cultural influences on purchasing behavior. Applications to advertising, product, and segmentation strategies as well as Web-based applications of consumer behavior are highlighted.                         Marketing Planning &amp; Strategy      MKTG-GB.2350 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Approximately 95 percent of a brand manager\u2019s responsibilities involve the development, execution, evaluation, and refinement of marketing plans. In this tremendously practical, semester-long course, developed based on best practices at top marketing companies, students are guided through the entire marketing plan process. Teams then apply the learning to create comprehensive plans for \u201creal\u201d brands at \u201creal\u201d companies, in the industry of their choice. The course covers the ins and outs of brand positioning, marketing plan budget setting, pricing strategy development, and volume forecasting. Media plans and ads are created, as well as consumer promotion, trade promotion, direct marketing, Internet marketing and viral/buzz marketing plans.                         Competitive Marketing Strategy      MKTG-GB.2351 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course is designed to help you develop the knowledge and skills necessary to develop marketing strategy at the business (in contrast to product) level. Rather than just focusing on creating value propositions for customers, the emphasis in this course will be more strategic: designing value creation and delivery systems. Therefore, the course will target the interface between customer value, marketing decisions, business strategy, and the operations of the organization. The material will be particularly relevant to students who expect to be responsible for developing and/or assessing marketing strategy as owners, employees, and consultants.                         Pricing      MKTG-GB.2353 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Pricing is one of the most important but least understood marketing decisions. This course is designed to equip participants with the frameworks, techniques, and latest thinking on assessing and formulating pricing strategies. We will learn the process of making pricing decisions and explore innovative approaches for setting prices. The emphasis of the course is on ways in which you can help firms in diverse industries to improve their pricing. The topics of discussion include pricing of durable goods, pricing of consumer package goods, pricing of service, pricing of informational goods, new product pricing, price promotions, behavior-based pricing, price bundling, nonlinear pricing, targeted pricing, pricing through a distribution channel, and international pricing etc. Upon successful completion of this course, you will (a) gain a solid understanding of pricing practices across different industries, (b) learn state-of-the-art frameworks for analyzing pricing issues, and (c) master the essential techniques for making profitable pricing decisions with strategic thinking.                           Data-Driven Decision Making      MKTG-GB.2354 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.1305              The specific objectives of this course are to: 1.

Competitive Strategy in the Marketplace      MKTG-GB.2361 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2103 OR COR1-GB.2301; and COR1-GB.2310. Not open to students who have taken MKTG- GB.2360.              This is a rigorous advanced course in competitive strategy set at the level of the business as it faces competitors at the product market level. The course consists of lectures and formal case presentations recommending strategic actions by student teams to counterpart teams representing senior managers responsible for approving their recommendation. Topics covered include both the process and content of strategic action and interaction, strategic models, brands as a source of competitive advantage, methods for comparing competitive offers and strategies, scenario analysis, competitive signaling, and competitive intelligence.                           Brand Strategy      MKTG-GB.2365 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Brand planners/strategists face many challenges, including how to a) create a comprehensive brand architecture that will provide strategic direction, b) Generate motivating brand identities and value propositions for the key brands, c) develop brand-building programs, and d) leverage new technologies. The goal of this course is to provide concepts, models, methods, and role models that will help address these challenges.                         New Product Development      MKTG-GB.2370 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              New products and services are vital to the success of all companies. Innovation is risky, however, and most new products fail in the marketplace. Thus, expertise in the design and marketing of new products is a critical skill for all managers, inside and outside of the marketing department. There is a focus on the tools and techniques associated with analyzing market opportunities and then designing, testing, and introducing new products and services. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are covered. In particular, the course covers the new product development process, market entry strategies, how to generate new product ideas, mapping customer perceptions, segmentation, product positioning, forecasting market demand, product design, and advertising and product testing. The course emphasizes how to incorporate customers and competitors into all of these aspects of new product development. In contrast, a related course (B60.3356, Technological Innovation &amp; New Product Development) emphasizes organizational issues associated with new product development.                         Innovation and Design      MKTG-GB.2371 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Many firms that have experienced dramatic gains in shareholder value over the last few years (e.g., Google, Apple, Motorola) register innovation as a central driver of their progress. One can argue that innovation, and a culture that inspires and supports innovation, is the only sustainable competitive advantage. A frequent manifestation of recent innovation has been breakthrough design. Design represents a powerful alternative to the dominant management approaches of the last few decades and is an important perspective for leadership to embrace.                         Retail Strategy      MKTG-GB.2375 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Virtually every major consumer brand is sold through a variety of retail channels. The store is where brand and consumer \u201cmeet\u201d and the purchase decision is made. In the last twenty-five years, a variety of trends have converged to create a situation today in which major retailers are arguably the dominant influence on a brand's success. The bottom line: consumers are getting harder and harder to reach and influence, and they make 70% of their brand purchase decisions in-store. Retail Marketing has emerged as a key element of the marketing mix. This course will provide students with a solid understanding of the retail landscape, covering all key classes of trade. That understanding of the key retail channels will be integrated with an in-depth review of effective marketing strategies for each channel. We will also explore how the retail marketing elements are integrated into the overall marketing framework for the brand. Text and case studies will be used, as well as current literature. Numerous industry experts, from both the retail and consumer goods world, will be utilized as class speakers.                         Creativity      MKTG-GB.2381 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              Successful business people approach their problems creatively and happy people live their lives as works of art. In this course we explore the many dimensions of creativity that are important in business and in our own lives. Creativity isn\u2019t a mystical quality with which only a few are blessed. Practical methods to become more flexible, imaginative, and productive thinkers can be learned by anyone, nurtured in others, and harnessed to create new products, uses, designs, theories, strategies, structures, and other solutions of all kinds. We will define creativity, review the science, and develop our own creative skill set by learning about, experiencing, and experimenting with a wide variety of approaches.                         Global Marketing Strategy      MKTG-GB.2385 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course examines the development of international marketing programs, from determining objectives and evaluating international market opportunities to coordinating strategies in world markets. It differentiates between global and multi-national approaches to all elements of the marketing mix. There is an emphasis in the application of marketing principles in the multinational environment and the cultural influences that require adaptation of strategies in diverse markets.                         Corporate Branding and CSR      MKTG-GB.3101 (3 credits)     Prerequisite: COR1-GB.2310              This course provides a theoretical and strategic overview of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the context of corporate branding. The theory of the course proceeds from: i) the corporate need to protect long-term investments in corporate brand image, ii) the emergence of large segments of affluent, ethically sensitive consumers, and iii) the incompleteness of law and regulation, especially in global markets. The practical and strategic content of the course is derived from a number of cases with guest participants drawn from corporations, NGO, and investment management firms. This course should be of interest to Marketing majors and all NYU students seeking to better understand the politics, strategy, and implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility.

Research to support international marketing decisions has  evolved over the past four decades and must change even more to support firms in the 21st century. There are four  key areas where progress must be made. First, international marketing research efforts need to be more closely  aligned with market growth opportunities outside the industrialized nations. Second, researchers must develop the  capability to conduct and coordinate research that spans diverse research environments. Third, international marketing  researchers need to develop new creative approaches to probe the cultural underpinnings of behavior. Finally, technological  advances need to be incorporated into the research process in order to facilitate and expedite research conducted  across the globe.       International Marketing Research in the 21st Century       Introduction   Businesses preparing to compete in the 21st century are increasingly confronted with the task of crafting strategies  that anticipate and respond to the rapid pace of change in global markets. As a result, their information needs  are changing and becoming ever more complex and diverse. Timely, relevant information is essential to provide an  adequate basis for day-to-day decision-making as well to chart the firms path in an increasingly fast paced, turbulent  and competitive environment.     Information needs are changing in both developed and developing countries.  Established markets in industrialized countries are becoming more geographically integrated as direct vertical  links and information flows are established between customers, retailers and suppliers. As a result, there is a  growing need to conduct research spanning country boundaries, in order to identify regional or global market segments,  or to examine opportunities for integrating and better co-ordinating strategies across national boundaries. At  the same time, speed in collection and interpretation of results from multiple and geographically diverse sources  become imperative in order to anticipate market change and devise an effective response strategy.     As firms push the geographic frontiers of their operations to take advantage  of growing opportunities, they need to collect information from a broader and more diverse range of markets. Increasingly,  this entails conducting research in unfamiliar and distant markets in the Far East, the Middle East, Latin America  and Africa. This in turn poses a number of challenges, not only in collecting accurate and reliable information  on existing behavior patterns in an expeditious and cost effective fashion, but also in predicting response to  new and unfamiliar stimuli, and interpreting the implications for marketing strategy.     Advances in technology both facilitate and at the same time render more complex,  the collection of data on a global basis. The growth and increasing technological sophistication of the communication  infrastructure enables data collection on a much broader and diverse geographic scale and with a rapidity previously  unthinkable. Yet, at the same time, management has to master these tools and understand their inherent limitations  and implicit biases.   The purpose of this paper is to explore these changes in information needs and technology and suggest the implications  for conducting marketing research in the global environment. Specifically, the paper examines the capabilities  and skills international researchers will need to acquire in order to conduct research in the increasingly diverse  and rapidly changing marketplace of the 21st century.       The Changing Global Environment   Evolution of international marketing research   To understand the research needs of the 21st century it is important to consider how they have changed over the  past four decades. In the 60s and 70s, many U.S. firms, faced by slackening rates of growth in their domestic  markets, began to venture into international markets. Japanese and European firms with smaller domestic markets  also expanded internationally in order to broaden the geographic scope of their operations and take advantage of  potential economies of scale or to respond to foreign competition entering their domestic markets (Douglas and  Craig, 1989). In this initial phase of international market entry, firms were mostly concerned with collecting  information to identify and assess market opportunities in other countries to determine which markets to enter,  how to position products in these markets and how far to adapt different elements of the marketing mix to local  market conditions.     At this phase of the firms expansion, the country was typically used as the  unit of analysis for the research design, for developing the sampling frame, as well as for data collection. Due  to economic, political, linguistic and cultural barriers, the country was the focal point of entry decisions. Equally,  the firms international operations were often organized on a country-by-country basis. Marketing research agencies  were also typically national organizations, with relatively few having the capability to conduct research on a  multi-country basis. Most secondary data as well as sampling lists were available on a national basis.     As, however, firms have expanded internationally and product markets are becoming  increasingly integrated worldwide, the key decision issues facing the firm in the 90s have changed dramatically.  As a result, research and information needs have changed and broadened. In industrialized nations such as North  America, Europe and Japan, regional market integration and the removal of barriers between countries, the growth  of a regional and global market infrastructure as well as increased mobility of consumers have created pressures  to consolidate and integrate marketing strategy across countries. Consequently, increased attention is focused  on conducting studies which cover multiple countries examining differences and similarities in behavior and response  patterns across countries.     At the same time, as growth in these markets slows, future market potential  lies in emerging market economies, with countries such as China and India accounting for over one-third of the  worlds population. The explosive population growth in these countries, together with the opening up of markets  in the former Soviet Union makes entry into these markets mandatory for firms aspiring to be global leaders in  the future. In entering these markets, as in initially entering international markets, firms need to collect information  to assess potential opportunities, to determine how to position, price, promote and distribute their products and  brands, whether to develop local variants, etc.    The heterogeneity of research contexts   Currently, the vast majority of research, both commercial and academic, is conducted within the nations of the  Industrial Triad. In 1995, the world market for commercial research was estimated at approximately $10.2 billion  dollars. Of this, approximately 45% is conducted in Europe (42% within the EU), 34% in the U.S. and 10% in Japan.  These three geographic areas account for all but 11% of total spending on marketing research (ESOMAR, 1996). This  imbalance is likely to change in the future as an increased amount of research is conducted in emerging market  economies.     In emerging markets, conditions are not only changing very rapidly, but are  also substantially different from those in industrialized countries. Not only are consumer standards of living  and purchasing power much lower, but attitudes towards foreign products are often extremely complex, sometimes  ambivalent and difficult to predict. This coupled with the lack of a research or technological infrastructure to  facilitate the collection and analysis of data pose a considerable challenge not only in designing research, but  also in developing and implementing the collection of data.     In the less developed countries of the world, notably Africa and parts of  Asia, technological advances focus on development of the basic infrastructure roads, electricity, running water,  and rudimentary transportation and distribution systems. Such developments are essential in building the marketing  infrastructure. Electricity not only powers TV sets that carry commercials, but also is essential for the application  of computer technology and the development of more technologically advanced communications. Further, a dependable  electrical supply makes possible retail stores with refrigeration for staples and hence the distribution of consumer  packaged goods. The developments open up new markets and dramatically change the ways in which people live and  consumer. This in turn adds to the complexity of conducting marketing research as the range and nature of research  contexts become increasingly heterogeneous.    The global market place in transition   Developments in mass communication technology, global and regional media such as CNN, MTV, STAR TV, etc. create  an environment where certain segments of the population worldwide are developing a common set of expectations,  familiarity with a common set of symbols, similar preferences for products and services, and an overall desire  to improve their standard of living. Market segments such as teenagers share common interests in clothing fashions,  music, films and sports, as new trends and related products are rapidly diffused worldwide through global media.   Increasing discretionary expenditures in industrialized markets also expands the range of choice and the role of  services in consumer choice decisions. This coupled with the multiplicity of shopping modes available to the consumer  results in increased emphasis on examining the role of the shopping environment or context on choice behavior.  Information needs to be collected not only relating to customer preferences and the choice process, but also situational  and contextual variables, including the interaction of choice with the shopping context, as for example, the impact  of store ambience on shopping mood.     The expansion of retailers worldwide also facilitates marketing research.  As chains expand, they incorporate their &quot;best practices&quot; in the new stores. They incorporate POS scanner  technology, modern merchandising practices, and product mixes that both respond to local tastes and reflect the  firm's desire for economies of scale in buying from suppliers. The development of shopping malls, where there were  none, makes possible mall intercept interviews. Another consequence of the development of the marketing infrastructure  is the greater need for marketing research. As retailers expand in new markets changing and integrating the marketing  infrastructure, more marketing research is needed to track these changes and guide decision-making.    Implications for international marketing research in the 21st century   The dramatic changes in the global environment coupled with technological advances in data collection, analysis  and dissemination imply that researchers will need to broaden their capabilities in order to design, implement  and interpret research in the 21st century. As research efforts are aligned to match markets with the highest market  potential, researchers will need to develop the capabilities and skills to conduct and design research in these  environments (Barnard, 1997). New tools incorporating the latest technology will need to be mastered and creative  approaches to understanding behavior in differing cultural contexts developed. Ability to interpret and integrate  complex data from diverse sources and environments will also be critical in order to provide meaningful recommendations  for the firms global marketing strategy.    Aligning research effort and capabilities with market growth potential   A first priority is to focus research effort and capabilities on markets with future growth potential. As indicated  earlier, marketing research expenditures are heavily concentrated in the industrialized countries of North America,  Europe and Japan. This reflects the current size and attractiveness of these markets. However, the countries with  the highest growth potential are the emerging market economies in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, or countries  of the former Soviet Union. Firms who wish to succeed in the global markets of the 2lst century will need to pay  greater attention to examining markets in these regions of the world, and developing or acquiring the capabilities  to conduct research in these markets.   The stark differences between the developed and developing world are reflected in information taken from the 1999  UN Human Development Report (see Table). The UN categorizes 45 countries as having a high level of human development  (HHD), 94 as medium (MHD), and 35 as low (LHD). The data in the table dramatically illustrate the gulf that exists  between the richest countries and the poorest. The per capita GNP in HHD countries is more than 18 times that of  MHD countries, and 87 times that of LHD countries. Yet, over 80% of the worlds population live in countries that  are categorized as either MHD or LHD. Equally, critical for conducting marketing research are differences in illiteracy   less than 5% in HHD countries compared with over 50% of the population in LHD countries.     Conducting research successfully in these regions requires both understanding  and sensitivity to differences in the market environment as well as an ability to deal with the lack of a well-developed  market research infrastructure. The accuracy of results hinges in part on the respondents ability to understand  the questions being posed. Low levels of literacy in emerging markets as well as lack of familiarity with stimuli  or response formats from industrialized markets create challenges. In designing research instruments, caution needs  to be exercised in directly transposing stimuli or research formats commonly adopted in industrialized countries.  Rather, researchers need to think creatively in designing instruments that are readily understood and unambiguously  interpreted, and as far as possible, devoid of cultural bias. In particular, design of instruments that employ  visual as well as verbal stimuli and occur in a familiar and realistic setting rather than requiring abstract cognitive  skills will be more effective.     The absence of a well-developed market research infrastructure is also a major  hindrance to the conduct of marketing research in emerging markets. The quality of the research infrastructure  is reflected in statistics on telephone lines and Internet hosts per 1,000 people. In the HHD countries there are  ten times as many telephone lines as in MHD countries and over 125 times that in LHD countries. Internet connections,  which are becoming a critical element of research in many of the HHD countries, are directly available to less  that 1 person in 1,000 in the MHD and LHD countries.     Interpretation of results from emerging market countries may also pose some  challenges especially for researchers from other sociocultural backgrounds. Researchers need to be wary of interpreting  results in terms of their own culture and experience, and in particular, of generalizing from experience in industrialized  markets to emerging markets. Indigenous researchers, on the other hand, trained in a different research paradigm,  may interpret results in terms of the local context, and focus on the uniqueness of these patterns. Consequently  teams of researchers from different backgrounds will be needed to provide a broad and balanced interpretation.       Conducting and co-ordinating research spanning diverse environments   The increasing diversity of the sociocultural and economic environment in which research is being conducted, implies  that international marketing researchers will need to develop the capability to conduct and co-ordinate research  spanning a brand range of environmental contexts and research questions. In essence, researchers will need to be  able to tailor research questions, and adapt research instruments and administration procedures to different environments,  as well as to interpret or generalize results at a pan-cultural or global level. This goes beyond geographic co-ordination  of multi-country studies, translation and development of multilingual questionnaires or research instruments, and  requires skills in designing multi-site studies that include a common core and purpose, while at the same time  addressing country-specific issues (Douglas and Craig, 1997).     At a first level, skills in designing multi-site studies in diverse environments  will increasingly be required. Here, although the key research questions are clearly identified and common across  sites, attention needs to be paid to how constructs are operationalized, research instruments designed, and sampling  and data collection conducted at each site. The definition of product categories may, for example, differ as well  as brand availability, the nature of the retail environment, or more insidiously, the socio-cultural context of  consumption. Constructs or definitions used in one context are not necessarily appropriate in another. Research  instruments, data collection or sampling procedures may incorporate bias, requiring reformulation or adaptation  to ensure meaningful results (Craig and Douglas, 2000).     Use of a team incorporating members from different cultural backgrounds and  sites helps to strike a balance between the need for local input and adaptation to local site conditions with the  need for comparability and equivalence across sites. Researchers from each site should participate in the early  stages of research design and in the interpretation of data and results, rather than merely acting as local implementers  of a centrally designed study. They can then provide input in the formulation of research questions and the design  of the research instrument as well as in sampling and data collection procedures. Equally, local researchers are  best placed to interpret findings from their sites in terms of local contextual factors, and to explain local anomalies  or differences.     At a higher or &quot;supra-country&quot; level, skills and capabilities in  designing and managing a research program which spans multiple, diverse environments are likely to become increasingly  critical. A research program might, for example, cover a product business or industry worldwide. If the product  business is at different stages of the product life-cycle in different regions or market conditions differ substantially,  as, for example, detergents, different types of research or information will need to be collected. Ability to define  relevant research issues in each context, and to coordinate and manage the different studies, will be critical  to provide meaningful input for the development of the firms long-run strategy in world markets.    Developing and using new tools   In addition, to developing the capabilities to conduct research spanning diverse environments, international marketing  researchers also need to create and make imaginative and thoughtful use of new approaches to understand the changing  market place. As qualitative research techniques advance and mature, they offer increasing promise as a means of  understanding and interpreting trends in diverse cultural contexts. Qualitative research provides insights and  understanding of the consumption and purchase context and the underlying determinants of behavior, as well as a  means of interpreting the results of quantitative research and predicting future trends.     Qualitative research techniques offer a number of advantages in international  marketing research insofar as they are unstructured and do not entail the imposition of the researchers prespecified  conceptual model or terminology on the respondent. As a consequence, qualitative techniques are especially helpful  in probing the contextual embedding of attitudes and behavior, providing deep understanding of situational and  contextual factors, and providing inputs into interpreting observed differences between countries and cultures  (Cooper, 1996). In addition, as qualitative techniques are often observational or unstructured, they require minimal  cognitive skills, and are particularly suited to research in emerging markets. They can also provide insights into  underlying or hidden motivations as well as probing future trends and scenarios.     Videotaping of consumers in purchase or consumption situations can provide  a rich source of information relating to the role of contextual and situational factors on consumer behavior and  response patterns in different cultures and contexts. Videotaping of consumers in an instore environment provides  a wealth of information about visual cues and their role in product evaluation not easily obtained from other forms  of data collection (Restall and Anton, 1995). In some cases, instore videotaping can be used to prompt or elicit  responses from consumers. In emerging markets, videotaping of consumer usage and consumption behavior often provides  deeper understanding of how consumers use products and how these are embedded in the cultural fabric of society,  as well as perceptions and associations of foreign products and brands.     Projective and elicitation techniques such as collages, picture completion,  analogies and metaphors, psychodrawing and personalization can be used to encourage respondents to project their  private and unconscious beliefs and personal and subjective associations. Collages, were, for example used in a  study of teenagers, worldwide to explore their feelings about the future. This revealed significant differences  between countries especially in terms of the degree of pessimism and hedonism (Thiesse, 1996). Equally, brand perceptions  can be explored through personalization, association techniques or analogies, to probe culturally embedded images  and associations that vary across cultures.     Focus groups and extended creativity groups can also be used to explore underlying  motivations, feelings and points of view. These techniques can be used to screen new product ideas and concepts  or develop ideas for a new positioning or advertising theme or to examine future trends. Use of such techniques  is likely to become increasingly critical in the 21st century as managers seek to identify new products or ideas  that will appeal to cross-national segments or consumers worldwide. Their unstructured character facilitates identification  of ideas, concepts and trends, which are truly universal, rather than reflecting the influence of any specific  culture or country.    Incorporating technological advances into research design and methodology   At the same time, international marketing researchers will need to incorporate the latest technological developments  in data collection and dissemination into the research design. These enable researchers to dramatically reduce  the time required to collect data across geographic distances as well as substantially enhancing and enriching  the type of stimuli that can be used in collecting data from international markets. It is, however, important to  recognize that use of sophisticated technological techniques is subject to certain limitations in international  markets, due either to the development of the technological infrastructure or the technological sophistication  of respondents.     Advances in computer technology such as scanners, CATI (Computer Assisted  Telephone Interviewing), and CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing) are well established in the developed  countries and are beginning to be used elsewhere. They provide faster, more accurate methods of data collection  providing direct input of response and facilitating steering of data collection based on response. Techniques such  as CATI and CAPI can also be used to centrally administer and organize data collection from international samples,  subject to telephone and computer penetration in different countries as well as use of a common language or availability  of software to automatically translate questionnaires.     As these technologies evolve and advance, they also provide new innovative  ways to present stimuli and collect data particularly suited to international research issues. Multimedia CAPI  makes possible the presentation of highly complex stimuli and facilitates obtaining consumer reactions to video  and audio stimuli (Thomae, 1995). Developments in virtual reality CAPI will heighten the realism in stimulus portrayal  and expand the range of topics on which marketing research can meaningfully be conducted (Needel, 1995).     Equally, as the Internet evolves, it offers the potential to dramatically  change the way in which much international marketing research is conducted, both in providing ready access to secondary  data, and in providing a new means of collecting primary data. Rather than visiting a traditional research library,  the marketer can have virtually instant access to data from traditional sources as well as sources that are only  available on the Internet. The Internet can also be used to collect primary data, either by tracking visitors to  a Web site, or through administering electronic questionnaires over the Internet. To the extent that web sites  are increasingly likely to be accessed by users worldwide, information on an international sample can be gathered.  Behavior at the site can be tracked revealing interest relating to the products and services or information offered,  as well as response to promotional material or offers.     The Internet can also be used to collect data in a more systematic fashion  that is closer in character to more traditional marketing research practice. Subject to the availability of suitable  Internet sampling frames, questionnaires can be administered directly over the Internet. Questionnaires are sent  via e-mail to respondents and the responses are returned via e-mail. This represents a very quick and totally automated  means to conduct a survey over a broad geographic scope. The results are available almost instantaneously as the  responses can be checked and analyzed in real-time as they are received. Questionnaires administered via the World  Wide Web also have the advantage that product details, picture of products, brands and the shopping environment  can be portrayed with integrated graphics and sound.     This approach is most suited to surveys among respondent populations that  are technology literate, and at present for certain types of products such as computers, computer software or business-to-business  research (Frost, 1998). However, as use of the Internet becomes more common place, e-mail surveys will begin to  replace mail and phone surveys. Progress will occur most rapidly in the US and Europe and will progress more slowly  in other parts of the world (Worldwide Internet Conference, 1999).     An important limiting factor is the extent to which Internet sampling frames  correspond to respondent populations that are of interest to marketers. Versions of Web software available in different  countries may not be compatible. Technical issues may daunt respondents, resulting in non-response bias. Factors  such as overall response rate and item non-response will also continue to be important. Consequently, a large number  of surveys need to be sent out to obtain a large enough sample to analyze. However, the fact that results will  be obtained so rapidly will allow additional sampling, with enhanced incentives, to compensate for short fall.  While lower costs and rapidity of response make this mode attractive for international research, potential bias  problems suggest that at least in the short run, and particularly where part of the target market is likely to  exist in countries with low internet access, this approach will need to be used with some caution.    Conclusion   Change is occurring in virtually all aspects of business and personal life. These changes are being played out  at different rates in different parts of the world. Against this backdrop, marketing researchers are being challenged  to conduct research that is of the highest possible quality, as quickly as possible, in multiple diverse settings.  The issues marketing researchers face are multifaceted and relate to where and how research will be conducted,  who the respondents will be, and the tools and techniques that will be used.     Marketing researchers must find creative ways to harness the new technologies  to facilitate the conduct of research and enhance its value to clients. At the same time research organizations  must begin to develop the capability to conduct marketing research simultaneously in the developed and the developing  world. Increasingly multi-national marketers are designing and selling global brands and need research to guide  their decision making across an increasingly diverse and disparate world. Sound and timely marketing research becomes  even more critical for firms as they compete in the 21st century.            References       Barnard, P.
