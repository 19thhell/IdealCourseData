If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Check out the online preview, available on the housing portal .     Phase 2: Room Selection is the process by which students are given the opportunity to select a room online from the available housing inventory. Selection times are determined randomly within priority groups. Students submitting names together (for room, suite or hall placement) will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   The Phase 2 Room Selection will take place between March 30, 2015 and April 3, 2015.   Due to the high demand for NYU Housing, not all students may be able to select a space during the Phase 2: Room Selection. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services will administratively assign students who are unable to select their room over the summer. In this situation, students are still committed to the full terms of the housing license as outlined in the key components of the process . Students should re-review the 2015-2016 proposed housing rates prior to the start of Phase 2.     The Room Selection step can only be accessed through the housing application portal on your NYUHome account. There you will find the &quot;Housing Forms Log-In&quot; channel on the NYU Life page. Click on the &quot;Student Housing and Meal Plan Forms&quot; link and follow the University login prompts to access the application portal. Once in the portal, you may access the housing re-application by clicking the &quot;Application&quot; link in the grey navigation bar. You will want to select the &quot;Academic Year 2015-2016&quot; application. Once in the application, you will be able to readily access Phase 2.

Please make note the special interest programs in the following buildings.     Broome Street will house the Residential College program.   Seventh Street will house the Green House program.   West 13th Street will house the Senior House Program            SELECTION TIME NOTIFICATION   Room Selection times are determined by a randomized sorting within priority categories. Students who have registered in a group will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   Students will be notified by 5pm on March 27, 2015 (date subject to change) via their NYUHome account of the specific date and time that they will be able to access the Room Selection step, view the available inventory, and select a room. Students will be able to access the Room Selection step through the Housing Forms Channel at NYUHome .   While students are not required to choose an assignment at their selection time, other students will continue to be rolled into the selection pool, making it likely that there will be fewer spaces as the process continues. The process will be open through 5:00pm EST on April 3, 2015, as space permits, for students to make a room selection for next year.       SELECTION TIMES     The selection times are randomly generated based on students\u2019 individual priority or averaged group priority (if a student has registered with a group in Phase 1).   Students participating in Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, the Senior House, or the Residential College will only be able to select within the program to which they were accepted.   Students participating in the Residential College will begin selecting on Monday, March 30, 2015 (date subject to change) .   The general student room selection process (including Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, and the Senior House) will begin on Tuesday, March 31, 2015 (date subject to change) .   Once selection times are determined, timetables will be provided to give students a better idea about where their selection time falls within the overall process.

When you access the Phase 2 step, you will be able to browse through the available inventory and select a room. Once your room has been confirmed, it cannot be changed. Be sure to make your selection carefully. Students can access the Phase 2: Room Selection step in the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     SELECTING AS A GROUP   All individuals within a group can log in and select independently OR allow the Group Leader to select for them. Only the Group Leader can select for other group members. The Group Leader may only select spaces for group members within the same suite or floor.   As space becomes limited, groups may be forced to split apart. If possible, all group members are encouraged to be together to assist the Group Leader with selection decisions. It is critical that group members discuss options and alternatives. Once an assignment is confirmed, it cannot be changed.   If the Group Leader does not assign all members of the group, the unassigned members are responsible for individually assigning themselves anytime after their group selection time but prior to April 3, 2015. Students can access the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     CONSOLIDATION POLICY   In an effort to create more housing options for incoming and existing residents, ensure equity, and maximize use of available space, the University will actively seek to consolidate vacancies within the University Housing system. Students that are assigned to partially vacant rooms may be reassigned. This means that the hall, room, and/or roommates you select now may be changed if necessary for consolidation purposes. Consolidation may occur prior to check-in or during the academic year and students may be reassigned to other rooms, floors, or residence halls where necessary.       POST SELECTION ROOM CHANGE PROCESS   Students who are dissatisfied with their room selection may submit a Post Selection Room Change Request. Students must select a space in Phase 2 in order to be considered in the Post Selection Room Change process. The online room change form will be available on March 30, 2015 through May 15, 2015.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Check out the online preview, available on the housing portal .     Phase 2: Room Selection is the process by which students are given the opportunity to select a room online from the available housing inventory. Selection times are determined randomly within priority groups. Students submitting names together (for room, suite or hall placement) will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   The Phase 2 Room Selection will take place between March 30, 2015 and April 3, 2015.   Due to the high demand for NYU Housing, not all students may be able to select a space during the Phase 2: Room Selection. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services will administratively assign students who are unable to select their room over the summer. In this situation, students are still committed to the full terms of the housing license as outlined in the key components of the process . Students should re-review the 2015-2016 proposed housing rates prior to the start of Phase 2.     The Room Selection step can only be accessed through the housing application portal on your NYUHome account. There you will find the &quot;Housing Forms Log-In&quot; channel on the NYU Life page. Click on the &quot;Student Housing and Meal Plan Forms&quot; link and follow the University login prompts to access the application portal. Once in the portal, you may access the housing re-application by clicking the &quot;Application&quot; link in the grey navigation bar. You will want to select the &quot;Academic Year 2015-2016&quot; application. Once in the application, you will be able to readily access Phase 2.         RESIDENCE HALL AVAILABILITY   (Hall availability is subject to change.)        Brooklyn Halls   Clark Hall  Othmer Hall (limited availability)      Manhattan Halls   Alumni Hall  Broome Street Coral Tower  Carlyle Court (towers 2 &amp; 3) Gramercy Green Greenwich Hall  Lafayette Street Palladium Hall Second Street  Seventh Street West 13th Street University Hall (limited availability)  Fall Only:     Affina Manhattan Carlyle (tower 1)       Most buildings will have a number of spaces withheld from general room selection for pre-designated Explorations and Special Interest Programs.   Please make note the special interest programs in the following buildings.     Broome Street will house the Residential College program.   Seventh Street will house the Green House program.   West 13th Street will house the Senior House Program            SELECTION TIME NOTIFICATION   Room Selection times are determined by a randomized sorting within priority categories. Students who have registered in a group will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   Students will be notified by 5pm on March 27, 2015 (date subject to change) via their NYUHome account of the specific date and time that they will be able to access the Room Selection step, view the available inventory, and select a room. Students will be able to access the Room Selection step through the Housing Forms Channel at NYUHome .   While students are not required to choose an assignment at their selection time, other students will continue to be rolled into the selection pool, making it likely that there will be fewer spaces as the process continues. The process will be open through 5:00pm EST on April 3, 2015, as space permits, for students to make a room selection for next year.       SELECTION TIMES     The selection times are randomly generated based on students\u2019 individual priority or averaged group priority (if a student has registered with a group in Phase 1).   Students participating in Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, the Senior House, or the Residential College will only be able to select within the program to which they were accepted.   Students participating in the Residential College will begin selecting on Monday, March 30, 2015 (date subject to change) .   The general student room selection process (including Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, and the Senior House) will begin on Tuesday, March 31, 2015 (date subject to change) .   Once selection times are determined, timetables will be provided to give students a better idea about where their selection time falls within the overall process.

When you access the Phase 2 step, you will be able to browse through the available inventory and select a room. Once your room has been confirmed, it cannot be changed. Be sure to make your selection carefully. Students can access the Phase 2: Room Selection step in the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     SELECTING AS A GROUP   All individuals within a group can log in and select independently OR allow the Group Leader to select for them. Only the Group Leader can select for other group members. The Group Leader may only select spaces for group members within the same suite or floor.   As space becomes limited, groups may be forced to split apart. If possible, all group members are encouraged to be together to assist the Group Leader with selection decisions. It is critical that group members discuss options and alternatives. Once an assignment is confirmed, it cannot be changed.   If the Group Leader does not assign all members of the group, the unassigned members are responsible for individually assigning themselves anytime after their group selection time but prior to April 3, 2015. Students can access the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     CONSOLIDATION POLICY   In an effort to create more housing options for incoming and existing residents, ensure equity, and maximize use of available space, the University will actively seek to consolidate vacancies within the University Housing system. Students that are assigned to partially vacant rooms may be reassigned. This means that the hall, room, and/or roommates you select now may be changed if necessary for consolidation purposes. Consolidation may occur prior to check-in or during the academic year and students may be reassigned to other rooms, floors, or residence halls where necessary.

Current Spring 2015 undergraduate residents and undergraduate students that have maintained their renewable housing status are able to participate in this process to secure housing for the 2015-2016 academic year. Students should be familiar with the key components of the process prior to applying.     PHASE 1 - Reapplication &amp; Payment (Phase 1 is now closed)   Phase 1 began on March 3, 2015 at 12 Noon EST and was be open through 5pm EST March 12, 2015.   During this time period, students who wished to maintain their renewable housing status and/or secure housing for the 2015-2016 academic year must have completed the online application, via NYUHome , and submitted the $1000 reservation payment by 5pm EST on March 12, 2015.   Optionally, students may have also applied for Special Interest Housing and/or created a group with other students to go through the Phase 2 - Room Selection process together.   This is the only Phase required to secure housing for the 2015-2016 Academic Year. Students who have completed Phase 1 are guaranteed placement even if they choose not to participate in Phase 2. Students unable to select a specific space during Phase 2 will be assigned over the summer based on space availability and expressed preferences.   Important Note: Failure to complete Phase 1 by March 12, 2015 will lead to the loss of guaranteed housing in the future.                           Phase 1 Reapplication Instructions                                                                  PHASE 2 - Room Selection (Phase 2 is now closed)   Phase 2 will begin on March 30, 2015 and will be open through 5pm EST on April 3, 2015.   Students who completed Phase 1 will be sent a selection time based on their priority that will allow them access to the housing inventory.
