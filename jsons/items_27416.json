Starting Spring 2010, this course will require Writing the Short Screenplay (H56.1020) or Script Analysis (H56.1084).    Students are given the choice of writing an Original Pilot or a Spec Script for an existing hour-long drama. The course examines the structure and storytelling techniques necessary to write a 60-minute script--A, B, C and D stories. Students choosing to write a Spec for an existing show will begin by pitching their story ideas, writing an outline, then moving on to the first draft of a script. Those who choose to write an Original Pilot will start by presenting their premise, characters and storylines before moving on to an outline and the script. Each week we will read scripts from current shows or watch episodes of specific hour-long dramas to study their structure and plotting.
