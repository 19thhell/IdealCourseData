Also mentioned above, during the first year, the student must secure a faculty mentor from within the department who has formally agreed to supervise the thesis research or independent project. Upon approval by the Biomaterials and Biomimetics Department Chairman, a Co-mentor from another department in the University may be assigned to advise the student.   Thesis research protocol.&amp;nbsp;The thesis proposal (protocol) for the completion of original research must be: (1) approved by the mentor and the Department Chair, (2) filed with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Laboratory Manager, and (3) presented and approved at a department research meeting. The student must have received a grade of P in the Introduction to Research in Biomaterials course.   The plan of study and the thesis research are formulated in consultation with the faculty mentor(s). The thesis must represent original, independent research in a significant area of biomaterials and biomimetics at a level comparable to research published in recognized journals or as professional monographs. When the thesis is completed and has been approved by the mentor(s) and by a research advisory committee (readers) assigned by the Director of Graduate Studies, the candidate defends the results of the research before a faculty committee. No more than twelve months should lapse between the approved proposal and the thesis defense. Exceptions requiring time extension must be approved by the Chair of the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics or program director.   Non-thesis option. The nature of the independent project in Biomaterials must be developed in consultation with a faculty mentor and approved by the director of graduate studies.

Over the past 5 years Dr. McDevitt has served as the Principal Investigator for 6 major clinical trials and 2 clinical pilot studies, all involving the programmable bio-nano-chip. Through these clinical efforts, mini-sensor ensembles are being developed for major diseases in the areas of oral cancer, cardiac heart disease, trauma, drugs of abuse, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.     Dr. McDevitt&rsquo;s research expertise, coupled with his entrepreneurial approach, make him uniquely well-qualified to lead the Department of Biomaterials and Biomimetics in developing interdisciplinary, synergistic partnerships among investigators and educators at NYUCD and its College of Nursing and with NYU&rsquo;s Polytechnic Bioengineering Institute, all of which are housed in the newly opened, interprofessional facility at 433 First Avenue.   Journal Articles Below provided is a selected list of publications from the year 2000 to present. A comprehensive list of McDevitt group manuscripts may be found online at the following URL: http://library.med.nyu.edu/api/publications?person=jtm13/ .   About 5 years ago the McDevitt laboratory initiated the launching of a series of clinical trials that involved 3 years of patient recruitment and a couple of years of chip-based measurements. As is typical for trials of this type, the main findings can&rsquo;t be communicated until all clinical results for all patients are recorded. In just the last few months, several of these trials have reached maturity and the first series of publications have been released. Some of these recent clinical trial findings are included in the below listings for the year 2014. Stay tuned for more details...        185. J.L. Ebersole, C. Campbell, John McDevitt, and C.S.

Research Interests Dr. John T. McDevitt is the Chair of the Biomaterials Department at New York University. He is also a member of both the NYU Bioengineering Institute and the NYU Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. McDevitt is a well-recognized national and international expert in the development of imaged-based biosensors. Over the past few years, he has served as the Principal Investigator for 6 major clinical trials and has a strong track record of translating essential bioscience discoveries into real-world clinical practice. His research team has developed a broad menu of tests spanning from general chemistry, protein, antibody, drug-metabolite, oligonucleotide, cell counting and cytology applications all using the same image-based approach.     This document serves to provide a concise overview of the McDevitt group&rsquo;s programmable bio-nano-chip (p-BNC) research and related accomplishments. The McDevitt group efforts encompass basic research (&gt;185 publications), a broad base of Federal and Foundation support (exceeding $30M over the past decade), strong intellectual property protection (&gt;145 patents and patent applications), execution of 6 major clinical trials and the launching of three diagnostic companies (with &gt; $42M in private funding).     For the past decade, McDevitt has led and served as the Principal Investigator for two consecutive U-01 Cooperative Research programs that have targeted the development of a chip-based universal sensor platform with capacity to digitize biology. His recent research has been sponsored by major programs funded by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through both U-01 and Grand Opportunity (1% pay line) Awards, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Home Office Scientific Development Branch.     Leveraging strong foundations in nano-science and bioengineering, microfabrication techniques, microfluidics, biosensors, biomaterials, clinical chemistry and artificial intelligence, the McDevitt laboratory over past decade has not only pioneered development of the p-BNC sensor platform, but also begun to use this powerful information gathering tool to gain molecular level insights into disease progression. These mini-detection ensembles with multiplexed and multi-class (cellular, genomic, proteomic) capabilities have been customized for cancer diagnostics, cardiovascular disease, saliva-based diagnostics, infectious diseases, drugs of abuse detection, and cell imaging systems. Over the past 5 years the McDevitt laboratory has secured an in-depth experience with management and execution of international clinical trials that has resulted in the collection of unique databases. These key efforts have defined &lsquo;first-in-kind disease-wellness signatures&rsquo; for the areas of oral cancer and cardiac heart disease (see below sections).     This work was recognized with the &ldquo;Best of What&#39;s New Award&rdquo; in the Medical Device Category for 2008 by Popular Science, the &ldquo;Best Scientific Advances Award&rdquo; in 1998 by the Science Coalition, and the Nokia Sensing XCHALLENGE Finalist Awards for both 2013 and 2014. The below pages provide additional background for the McDevitt laboratory focus over the past 5 years. More in depth content on these efforts can be found also in the citations listed below as well as online at the following URL: http://library.med.nyu.edu/api/publications?person=jtm13   General / Collaborative Research Summary of Clinical Trials:   The marriage of microelectronics with micro-fabrication methods fashioned and developed by bioengineers and steered by the dream team of clinicians many from the world&rsquo;s largest medical complex, creates an ideal environment for the development of the next generation of affordable and accessible medical microdevice technology.     The McDevitt Research Group at Rice University has pioneered the development of powerful, sensor devices. These modern diagnostic tools, recently been recognized as &quot;Best of What&rsquo;s New&quot; by Popular Science magazine and &quot;Best Advance of the Year&quot; by the Science Coalition, have the potential to replace hundreds of thousands of dollars&#39; worth of laboratory equipment while getting test results to patients in minutes instead of days.     The programmable Bio-Nano-Chips (p-BNCs) exceed the performance of modern macroscopic instruments using a chip-based approach. The programmability feature of the p-BNCs refers to the capacity of the sensor ensemble to function as a standard platform that can be re-tasked (i.e. programmed) to serve a new application through insertion of molecular level code (i.e. the biomarker-specific reagents). The Bio terminology refers to the capacity to measure and extract the bio-signatures associated with the disease progression. The Nano element describes the capacity to miniaturize the system which is embodied in the use of nano-nets for efficient and rapid biomarker capture, as well as quantum dots for increased signal generation. The chip term emphasizes the capacity to mass-produce the sensor elements in way analogous to those used by the microelectronics industry that ultimately lead to high performance at reduced cost. The same sensor platform has the capacity to measure both soluble analytes using bead microreactors, as well as particulate analytes using membrane microstructures. Therefore, P-BNCs serve as flexible platforms for the analysis of both cellular (via membrane platform) and soluble targets (via bead platform).   Likewise, p-BNCs are being developed so as to collectively meet the most commonly cited attributes of coherently designed point of care sensors; these are:     &bull; Cheap - keeping costs low increases access to diagnostic testing;   &bull; Obvious - simple and easy user-interfaces allows use by unskilled operators;   &bull; Miniaturized - devices with reduced footprint are amenable to POC use;   &bull; Multiplexed - the ability to quantitate a number of different analytes concurrently increases the ability to effectively make diagnoses;   &bull; Automated - built-in sample processing, reagent handling, and data interpretation further promotes widespread access of diagnostic aides;   &bull; Non-perishable - rugged designs survive difficult storage, shipping, and handling as well as extreme temperatures; eliminating the so-called &lsquo;cold-chain&rsquo; also increases access to such systems; 1 year half-lives are desirable;   &bull; Dependable - the design should have an extremely low rate of failure and be highly reproducible, similar to six sigma and GLP quality control designs;   &bull; Quick - short turnaround time (TAT) gives information to physicians quickly which is especially important in emergency room environments;   &bull; Unobtrusive - non-invasive diagnostic specimens and sampling procedures reduces patient testing antipathy, making regular screening events possible;   &bull; Adaptable &ndash; modular devices have the ability to quantitate a variety of analytes (cells, proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, ions);   &bull; Limited - small reagent and sample volumes decrease costs and minimize requirements of biohazard waste disposal and environmental impact; and   &bull; Self-contained - reagent and power integration makes for a smaller device footprint; a closed system prevents exposure to biohazard waste.   The in development p-BNC technology has been refined and optimized recently to the point that it is now serving as a major tool for biomarker measurement and validation for a number of high impact clinical applications. Likewise, the p-BNC technology is now moving through six major clinical trials involving ten clinical sites and over 5000 patients as briefly described below:   Current Clinical Trials: A summary of the scope of the various clinical trials is provided below:   NIH-U01   Development of A Lab-on-a-Chip System for Saliva-Based Diagnostics   1000 patients (over 4 clinical sites)   09/01/06-2/28/11   Cardiac Disease   Cardiac heart disease is the number one killer in the world as well as in the United Stated. Building on the biomarker discoveries made for the heart attack test and the momentum gathered from the parent U-01 program sponsored by the NIH, the clinical study tasked here aims to validate a multiplexed salivary biomarker panel for the screening of AMI in the emergency room setting. The proposed research activities will be carried out by an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional team that leverages the strengths of a bioengineering group (at Rice) with expertise in biosensor development and a leading cardiology group at Baylor College of Medicine with an established record in cardiac research and clinical study infrastructure. The program will be conducted according to NIH/NIDCR guidelines on human subject safety benefiting from the guidance, monitoring and recommendations of the Clinical Study Oversight Committee (CSOC). The clinical program will also utilize the services of NIDCR&rsquo;s contractor Rho that will provide critical clinical operations and management support. The program&rsquo;s objectives will be met through the completion of a clinical study that will involve 500 chest pain patients recruited upon their admission to the emergency room. Whole blood and saliva samples will be collected from these patients at 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours from their time of presentation. Gold standard methodologies, such as serum testing and electrocardiogram (ECG), will be used to determine the subjects&rsquo; AMI status, while salivary biomarkers of myocardial injury will be measured using LUMINEX, ELISA and nano-bio-chip (NBC) technology pioneered in the McDevitt laboratory. The clinical accuracy of the NBC tests and biomarker concentration thresholds for the diagnosis of AMI for the salivary panel will be determined. Completion of the proposed activities will promote the translation of the saliva- based AMI tests by concurrently validating the biomarkers discovered in the parent program, as well as the NBC technology used for their measurement. These studies will pave the way to future clinical trials that will help fulfill regulatory requirements for FDA approval of the NBC tests, which may ultimately be used to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis of AMI chest pain, allowing triage to specialist care and improving the outcome for patients with AMI using saliva as the diagnostic fluid.   NIH-ARRA-Grand Opportunity Grant   Monitoring of Oral Cancer Patients Using Novel Lab-on-a-Chip Ensembles   950 patients (over 3 clinical sites)   9/25/09-8/31/11   Oral cancer, largely oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), is a global health problem afflicting close to 300,000 people each year. Despite significant advances in surgical procedures and treatment, the long-term prognosis for patients with OSCC remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate at approximately 50% that is among the lowest for all major cancers. High mortality associated with OSCC is often attributed to the advanced disease stage of many OSCCs upon initial identification and surgical biopsy, underscoring the need for new diagnostic methods targeting early tumor progression and malignant transformations. We propose here a broad, innovative, high impact and cross-cutting translational research program that targets development, testing and validation of powerful new microchip sensor systems for the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of potentially malignant lesions (PML) and malignant lesions of the oral cavity. This effort pairs the leading group involved in development of nano-bio-chip systems with leading clinicians in pathology and oral cancer research.     To support the testing and validation of the new microchip sensor systems, subjects will be recruited that are diagnosed clinically with a suspicious, potentially malignant (provisional clinical diagnosis of leukoplakia or erythroplakia) or oral squamous cell carcinoma, where a conventional biopsy is indicated. The programmable nano-bio-chip (PNBC) to be developed through this program will allow for the analysis of cellular samples obtained from a minimally invasive brush biopsy sample. The cell suspensions collected in this manner will allow for the simultaneous quantification of cell morphometric data and expression of molecular biomarkers of malignant potential in an automated manner using refined image analysis algorithms based on pattern recognition techniques and advanced statistical methods. This novel PNBC approach, which will turn around biopsy results in a matter of minutes as compared to days for traditional pathology methods, has already demonstrated its ability to distinguish between normal mucosa and oral cancer lesions. We propose here to adapt this chip-based platform to include a panel of biomarkers indicative of dysplasia as derived from cytomorphometric and molecular data as well as to assess the capabilities of this approach to function in point of care settings using noninvasive brush biopsy samples. The PNBC approach will be compared to the current standard of care based on biopsy and histopathological assessment of the lesions. The multi-institution, multi-disciplinary team assembled with members from Rice University, the Universities of Texas Health Science Centers in Houston and San Antonio, and the University of Sheffield, offers unique patient based case/control resources, biomarker and pathology proficiency combined with the expertise in integrated microchip sensors that will allow the team to develop new diagnostic aids for oral cancer patients that are desperately needed.   UK: Home Office- Contract   Advanced Nano-Bio-Chips for Saliva Based Drug Tests at the Point of Arrest   240 participants (over one clinical site)   9/1/09-3/31/11   Drugs of Abuse   Over the past years, the McDevitt laboratory has pioneered the development of a series of powerful nano-bio-chip sensor (NBC) systems that are suitable for a wide range of chemical, biological and cellular assays. Developed initially as &ldquo;electronic taste chips&rdquo;, these mini-sensors systems are fashioned with the same micro-fabrication methods used by the microelectronics industry. These devices are created in such a manner so they can be reprogrammed for new applications in an efficient manner while at the same time yielding sensors with strong analytical performance characteristics. Our laboratory has published several peer-reviewed papers documenting the formation of sensor systems, including one dedicated to the measurement of C- reactive protein. This saliva-based test exhibits 1000-fold decreases in the limit of detection relative to the 13 existing commercial products. More recently, the NBC approach was selected as part of Science Coalition&rsquo;s Best Scientific Advances for Year and for the 2008 Popular Science&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best of What&#39;s New Award&rdquo; in the Medical Device category for a new saliva-based heart attack diagnosis test system. Here, all aspects of saliva sample collection, processing, reagent manipulation, analyte isolation and detection are handled within these integrated ensembles. Leveraging these past successful activities, these proven mini-sensor systems will be adapted in this new program. Roadside NBC drug tests to be developed with this Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) program promise to serve as important tools for police officers to prosecute drugged driving. The NBC roadside drug tests are projected to save time and simplify the enforcement procedure by avoiding the need to take the suspected drugged drives to a police station, or health care facility, for testing. Completion of the proposed work promises a more convenient, cost-effective and comprehensive drug screening approach that may be applied for roadside testing of drivers at the point of arrest (POA).   CRPIT: Contract   Texas Cancer Diagnostics Pipeline Consortium: Oral Cancer   1200 Patients (over 2 clinical sites)   9/1/2010-8/31/2013   Oral Cancer   Oral cancer, largely oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), is a global health problem afflicting close to 300,000 people each year. Despite significant advances in surgical procedures and treatment, the long-term prognosis for patients with OSCC remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate at approximately 50% that is among the lowest for all major cancers. High mortality associated with OSCC is often attributed to the advanced disease stage of many OSCCs upon initial identification and surgical biopsy, underscoring the need for new diagnostic methods targeting early tumor progression and malignant transformations.   We are expanding on the current GO Grant that is expected to provide much valuable information by evaluating the technology in a population in which the prevalence of the disease reflects that of the intended use. Because it would not be possible to acquire the reference standard scalpel biopsies at the primary care setting, i.e., dental offices, which is ultimately where the technology is envisioned to revolutionize healthcare, recruitment will be initiated at both sites for studies of the low prevalence population by acquiring brush biopsy samples at secondary settings. While using some of these samples to address technical issues, the vast majority of the samples will be utilized to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the technique in a 2500 patient population with prevalence of the disease comparable to that found in the general population (~2-3%). These results would provide complimentary information to those projected to arise from the GO Program.   UT Heath Science Center, San Antonio proposes to recruit 200 study patients per year for five years for a total of 1000. Our two clinics combine for over 300 oral soft tissue biopsies per year, so we will have access to adequate patients. Our Research Nurse, Stephanie Rowan, will be focused full time on recruiting patients for this study. This will allow maximum patient accrual. If needed, other patients will be available as our two Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery practices have satellite clinic sites that can be added.     The clinical studies will focus mainly on lesions that have been clinically diagnosed as early OSCC, suspicious and potentially malignant (oral leukoplakia and erythroplakia) or other types of lesion that fall within the differential diagnosis of these, in which there is a clinical indication for a conventional scalpel biopsy.   The UTHSCSA Dental School clinical group led by Spencer Redding, Chair of Department of Dental Diagnostic Science, has a long and productive history of managing patients with oral cancer and potentially malignant oral lesions. The San Antonio clinical group will recruit patients with oral soft tissue lesions presenting for biopsy at two clinical sites, the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery outpatient clinic at the UTHSCSA Dental School and from the Alamo Maxillofacial Surgical Associates Practice both in San Antonio. These sites were chosen because of the large number of oral soft tissue biopsies performed per year (over 300). Brush biopsy clinical samples will be obtained from the clinical sites, processed and stored in Dr. Chih-Ko Yeh&rsquo;s lab, and then sent to Dr. McDevitt&rsquo;s lab at Rice to be evaluated in the lab on a chip system. Conventional tissue biopsies taken will be referred to Dr. Stan McGuff in the Department of Pathology at UTHSCSA for histopathological analysis.     The Dental Branch at the UTHSCH offers a wide range of oral health care programs for patients, including general dentistry, dental hygiene and specialty services, such as urgent care for acute dental and oral soft tissue disorders. Dr. Vigneswaran is involved in the diagnosis and care of patients with a variety of oral conditions including precancerous lesions in the pre- and post-doctorial clinics in which approximately 7,400 patients over the age of 30 are treated annually. Dr. Vigneswaran participates in the oral cancer screenings conducted by the UTDB Mobile Dental Van. Low-risk patient population seen in these community out-reach clinics will be a valuable resource to collect cytobrush specimens from various common confounding lesions such as frictional keratosis, lichen planus and chronic mucositis. Further, Dr. Vigneswaran has long-term research collaboration with Drs. El-Naggar and Williams (Head and Neck Pathologist, UT-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). Drs. El-Naggar and Williams will assist in collecting cytobrush specimens from fresh surgical resections of oral cancer (see letter of support). In addition to a large patient pool, and well-controlled animal studies, Dr. Vigneswaran&rsquo;s involvement in community outreach programs will prove particularly helpful to gather user requirements for future point of care deployment processing the brush biopsy samples and then shipping them to the McDevitt laboratory.   CRPIT: Contract   Texas Cancer Diagnostics Pipeline Consortium: Ovarian Cancer   275 Patients (over 2 clinical sites)   9/1/2010-8/31/2013   Ovarian Cancer   Ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies. This year in the US approximately 21,650 women will be diagnosed with OC and 15,520 will die from this disease. Despite advances in the management of OC, about 70-75% of women with OC are diagnosed with advanced stage disease where the cure rate is less than 20%. When OC is diagnosed in stage I, up to 90% of patients can be cured with conventional surgery and chemotherapy. Consequently, the rate of cure and overall survival might be significantly improved by detection of ovarian cancer at an early stage in a larger fraction of patients.   Across the clinical sites for this disease 3327 patients will be recruited. Blood will be drawn from control and case patients and shipped to Rice University for the testing of a bio-nano-chip.   Controls would be drawn from our screening trial and would include postmenopausal women age 50-74 able to give informed consent and exclude women with two or more relatives with breast or ovarian cancer, previous cancer or previous oophorectomy. The ovarian cancer patients would include women age 50-74 who were about to undergo surgery for a potentially malignant pelvic mass and be able to give informed consent. We would exclude patients with a previous history of cancer or previous oophorectomy.   CRPIT: Contract   Texas Cancer Diagnostics Pipeline Consortium: Prostrate Cancer   400 Patients (over one clinical site)   9/1/2010-8/31/2013   Prostrate Cancer   Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in American men. The current methods of screening for prostate cancer, which include digital rectal examinations (DREs) and serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), do not detect many prostate tumors including some of which that are high grade and aggressive.   In this CPRIT program we address the need for rapid assays for a more efficient screening of Prostate Cancer (PC) at the POC.The specific translational tasks of the proposal for prostate cancer are:   a) To develop and multiplex p-BNC assays for PSA, free-PSA and pro-PSA analytes.   b) To validate the analytical performance of the NBC tests.   c) To clinically validate the NBC assays by testing for the sensitivity and specificity of serum/blood protein markers alone or in combination for detection of prostate cancer.   d) To transfer the clinical (biomarkers and their disease-defining cut-off levels) and technological (assay conditions, NBCs design and analyzer requirements) specifications defined by these studies to a commercialization partner.
