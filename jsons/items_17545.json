The department rose to prominence in the mid-twentieth century for work in microwaves, communications, electrical machinery, and automatic control. Current research activities are organized into five major areas:     Communications, Networking, and Signal Processing   Systems, Control and Robotics   Energy Systems and Power Electronics   Electromagnetics and Analog/RF/Biomedical Circuits   Computer Engineering and VLSI     Faculty and students are engaged in research sponsored at an annual rate of about $7 million by government agencies and industrial organizations. Many of the projects are coordinated in two research centers: the Center for Advanced Technologies in Telecommunications (CATT) , which is sponsored by New York State, and the NYU WIRELESS center .   While the eminence of our department is partly due to the research and textbooks produced by our faculty, our strong reputation is largely a result of the success of our graduates in their careers after college. Therefore, the department is dedicated to serving the needs of its students, and preparing them for the evolving trends in their future fields of employment.   The department offers the following degree programs:   Undergraduate Programs (Accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org )     BS in Electrical Engineering   BS in Computer Engineering     Graduate Programs     PhD in Electrical Engineering   MS in Electrical Engineering   MS in Computer Engineering     CALL FOR APPLICATIONS: FALL 2015 PHD ADMISSIONS                                Electrical and Computer Engineering      Majors + Programs   Research Areas   Faculty Highlights   Undergraduate Courses   Career Resources   Department History   ECE Graduate Student Resources   People   Employment Opportunities   News   Events   Fellowships for New PhD Students   Contact                                    Engineering is NYU  Follow Us:  Facebook Twitter Vimeo YouTube        Undergraduate   Admissions   How to Apply   Apply Now   admissions@nyu.edu   Graduate   Admissions   Requirements   Apply Now   engineering.gradinfo@nyu.edu   Site Links   Press   Directory   Directions   Event Calendar   Careers/HR   Support    Email/Network help@poly.edu Website Report a Problem Login (Faculty + Staff)  NYU School of Engineering 6 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201 Tel: 718.260.3600 Fax: 718.260.3136 &copy; NYU School of Engineering"}]}]
