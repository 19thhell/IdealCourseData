The theme \"Immigration and Immigrants in Western Europe\"   will provide the framework around which the readings and discussion will center.   Focusing on a common theme will help reveal the range of research questions   and strategies pursued by scholars from diverse disciplines in the social sciences   and humanities while also allowing for substantive exploration of an issue that   has become central to social relations and political competition in contemporary   Western Europe. This focus will provide us with abundant material that is both   cross-disciplinary and comparative. Class-time will be divided between the discussion   of assigned readings intended to introduce interesting methodological and substantive   examples of research on a series of subjects within the literature on immigrants   and the introduction of library resources available to help conduct such research.     In this seminar we will explore immigration and patterns of immigrant incorporation   in Western Europe. Since the early 1960s immigration has transformed European   countries into a multi-racial and multi-ethnic societies. We will first explore   how public policy contributed to this transformation, how it was structured   by different concepts, traditions and laws on citizenship, and how it was related   to transformation of the party system and the emergence of the extreme right   in Western Europe. We will then analyze the impact of this transformation on   attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and   then to incorporate immigrants into the national community. Finally, we will   analyze the emergence of \"identity politics\" in Western Europe. We will explore   the impact of immigration on a wide range of public policies, as well as society   and identity.     Course Requirements   Students are expected to cover all assigned readings in advance of class and   be prepared to discuss them during the seminar. For Weeks II,V,VII,VIII,IX,X,XII   two students will be responsible for acting as discussion-leaders. By the Monday   before each of these classes each member of the seminar   must transmit to each of the discussion-leaders-- via e-mail/news-group-- their   reactions, comments and questions about the reading. The essay should also relate   these comments to the student's own research interests. Each student should   focus on one or two articles and/or book-chapters, and post their comments and   reviews on the \"newsgroup\" site. Each essay should be about 500 words (two double-spaced   pages). Each essay will be worth 15 points, and the total number of points will   become part of each student's grade at the end of the semester. The discussion-leaders   will then be responsible for synthesizing, summarizing and presenting these   comments around the following questions:   (a) What is/are the central question(s) addressed by the authors?   (b) What, if any, hypotheses are explored in this research?   (c) What are the main argument(s) developed by the authors?   (d) On the basis of what kinds of research and evidence have the authors developed   their studies? (e) What do you see as the strengths and shortcomings of this   research?   (f) What conclusions would you reach about the subject for this week on the   basis of these studies.   The principal requirement of this course will be a research paper due on Wednesday,   December 19 th . A two-page outline of the research paper must be submitted   to the instructors by October 3 rd . Papers (20-25 pages in length--   including bibliography and footnotes ) will be evaluated in terms of 1) the   research question(s) posed; 2) the relationship between the research question   and the research process; 3) evidence of the research process as demonstrated   through the literature review, bibliography, and notes (MLA citation style;   and 4) the insights produced by the entire process.     The final grade will be based on the final research paper (70%) and on written   comments reported on the \"newsgroup\" site, as well as on class discussion. (30%).

{"detail": [{"content": "Immigration and Politics Syllabus       UNDERGRADUATE SEMINAR ON IMMIGRATION AND POLITICS IN     WESTERN EUROPE     Fall, 2001     V42.0300   V53.0595   Martin A. Schain   Professor of Politics   Office: 58 W. 10 th St. (CES)   Office Hrs: Wed 1:00-2:30   998-2609 998 3838 (CES)/998 8531(Politics)   e-mail: ms5@nyu.edu  Ann Snoeyenbos  Librarian for West European and Social Studies  Bobst, Rm. 610  e-mail: ann.snoeyenbos@nyu.edu     The purpose of this course is to train undergraduates who are interested in   European studies in approaches to research, and in the sources and uses of research   materials on Europe. The theme \"Immigration and Immigrants in Western Europe\"   will provide the framework around which the readings and discussion will center.   Focusing on a common theme will help reveal the range of research questions   and strategies pursued by scholars from diverse disciplines in the social sciences   and humanities while also allowing for substantive exploration of an issue that   has become central to social relations and political competition in contemporary   Western Europe. This focus will provide us with abundant material that is both   cross-disciplinary and comparative. Class-time will be divided between the discussion   of assigned readings intended to introduce interesting methodological and substantive   examples of research on a series of subjects within the literature on immigrants   and the introduction of library resources available to help conduct such research.     In this seminar we will explore immigration and patterns of immigrant incorporation   in Western Europe. Since the early 1960s immigration has transformed European   countries into a multi-racial and multi-ethnic societies. We will first explore   how public policy contributed to this transformation, how it was structured   by different concepts, traditions and laws on citizenship, and how it was related   to transformation of the party system and the emergence of the extreme right   in Western Europe. We will then analyze the impact of this transformation on   attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and   then to incorporate immigrants into the national community. Finally, we will   analyze the emergence of \"identity politics\" in Western Europe. We will explore   the impact of immigration on a wide range of public policies, as well as society   and identity.     Course Requirements   Students are expected to cover all assigned readings in advance of class and   be prepared to discuss them during the seminar. For Weeks II,V,VII,VIII,IX,X,XII   two students will be responsible for acting as discussion-leaders. By the Monday   before each of these classes each member of the seminar   must transmit to each of the discussion-leaders-- via e-mail/news-group-- their   reactions, comments and questions about the reading. The essay should also relate   these comments to the student's own research interests. Each student should   focus on one or two articles and/or book-chapters, and post their comments and   reviews on the \"newsgroup\" site. Each essay should be about 500 words (two double-spaced   pages). Each essay will be worth 15 points, and the total number of points will   become part of each student's grade at the end of the semester. The discussion-leaders   will then be responsible for synthesizing, summarizing and presenting these   comments around the following questions:   (a) What is/are the central question(s) addressed by the authors?   (b) What, if any, hypotheses are explored in this research?   (c) What are the main argument(s) developed by the authors?   (d) On the basis of what kinds of research and evidence have the authors developed   their studies? (e) What do you see as the strengths and shortcomings of this   research?   (f) What conclusions would you reach about the subject for this week on the   basis of these studies.   The principal requirement of this course will be a research paper due on Wednesday,   December 19 th . A two-page outline of the research paper must be submitted   to the instructors by October 3 rd . Papers (20-25 pages in length--   including bibliography and footnotes ) will be evaluated in terms of 1) the   research question(s) posed; 2) the relationship between the research question   and the research process; 3) evidence of the research process as demonstrated   through the literature review, bibliography, and notes (MLA citation style;   and 4) the insights produced by the entire process.     The final grade will be based on the final research paper (70%) and on written   comments reported on the \"newsgroup\" site, as well as on class discussion. (30%).

Offered every other year. Corradi. 4 points.   Studies the premise that war is much more than a means to an end (a rational, if very brutal, activity intended to serve the interests of one group by destroying those who oppose that group). Mounds of evidence suggest that war exercises a powerful fascination that has its greatest impact on participants but is by no means limited to them. War, in short, is a complex web of affiliations and emotions.

They include urban/rural life, freedom/ confinement, memoir as source of voice/other sources of voice, generational separation and identity, and loss and healing. The course traces a movement through time from masculinist nationalism to the recognition of variations in gender, sexuality, race, class, region, and national origin. Other principles may be added to this list as the course proceeds.

The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview and permission of the director of internships.      Elective Courses Latino/a Art and Performance in New York City    SCA-UA 532 4 points.   Looks at the history of Latino/a art and performance in the context of New York City. In particular, students study Latino/a aesthetic practices within and against the social-political environment of their enactment. Latinos' role in the continually redefined realm of music, the extensive history of Latina/o contributions to the artistic vitality of the Lower East Side, and the wider performance context of Latina cultural production represent a few of the areas that are explored. Students consider contemporary Latino art, and the institutions that support it, from the perspective of the changing Latino demographic of New York City. Furthermore, students examine and analyze the specific ways that artists utilize the city as a site for artistic possibility. This course brings together both an investigation of the aesthetics of Latino performance and an investigation of democratic possibilities of urban space. In addition to the weekly seminar meeting, students are required to attend several performances, visit art galleries, and execute a research project profiling a particular artist or institution.    Latino/a Popular Culture   SCA-UA 534 4 points.   Latinos are at the heart of numerous genres of popular culture production: music, film, graphic novels, performance. This course examines contemporary popular culture products by and for Latinos, looking in particular at issues of production, circulation, and consumption. Is popular culture a site of Latino/a cultural expression, how and in what ways? How is it circulated and consumed, how is it mediated by different culture industries? What do we even mean by Latino/a popular culture? These and more questions are considered through a range of interdisciplinary studies.    Latino/a Sexualities   SCA-UA 536 4 points.   Examines the study of sexuality as it pertains to the production and representation of Latino/a identities. Students consider the integral roles scholarship and literature on/about Latino/a sexuality have played in the history of the broader U.S. feminist movement, feminist theory, and GLBTQ studies. The course begins with the examination of classic Chicana feminist texts and the anthropological study of Latino sexual practices in light of their influential interventions in U.S. studies on gender and sexuality since the 1980s and early 1990s. Students then explore more recent contributions by Latino scholars that disrupt the simplistic ways in which Latino/a sexuality has been taken up as an exotic and radical departure from foundational work on sexuality. Students engage sexuality in its plurality, examining multiple imaginings of Latino/a sexuality through fiction, performance theory, queer Latino/a critiques, and studies on emerging Latino masculinities.    The Latinized City, New York and Beyond   SCA-UA 540 Prerequisite: Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501), an introductory course in the social sciences, or a MAP Cultures and Contexts course.

Also examines identity-based social movements of the 1960s and \u201970s, depictions of Latinos as a pan-ethnic voting bloc during the 1980s and into today, the politics of transnationalism and globalization, and the recent political activism surrounding immigration. Looks at sub-group populations hailing from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central and South America, utilizes case studies, historical and theoretical monographs, primary documents, and recent poll data surveying Latino political behavior and opinions. Class Warfare SCA-UA 545 Offered every other year. 4 points. \u201cClass warfare\u201d became the political buzzword of the 2012 presidential election and in response to the 2008 financial crisis, and has continued to signal the primacy of inequality as the abiding public issue of our times. For social theorists, the \u201cclass warfare\u201d card is an open invitation to re-visit Marxist and other uses of the concept of class and its relevance to contemporary society. We will study how class conflict plays out in international and institutional settings or \u201ccomplexes\u201d of present-day society, such as neo-liberal politics, incarceration, educational apartheid, and mass deportation of immigrants, Discussion will be based on readings from classical and recent social analysis by a range of authors from Rousseau, Marx and Gramsci to Barbara Ehrenreich, Michelle Alexander and Naomi Klein, as well as important documentary films by Michael Moore, Charles Ferguson and Stephanie Black. We will end the course by examining a range of strategies for change and engagement in contemporary class warfare, with a focus on the Occupy Movement and its consequences. Latina Feminisms SCA-UA 548 4 points. Designed as seminar on contemporary cultural production by Latina feminist artists. Theory/cultural criticism paired with corresponding object of study, i.e. film, fiction, poetry, visual and performance art. First half of course models rigorous scholarship for student, offering different theoretical perspectives for interpreting cultural objects as social and political texts. Advanced seminar, experience with theoretical reading recommended. Second half of the course focuses on cultural production (film, fiction, poetry, visual and performance art). We will critically analyze recurrent tropes and themes\u2014the borderlands as geographical and psychic boundary; the \"mestiza\" or \"mulata\" body as metaphor; assimilation experiences and familial relations; racism and education; revolution and political violence as theme; the literature of exile; the figure of the Malinche/la llorona as race traitor or victim; the domestic/maquiladora worker as virgin or whore\u2014that occur throughout aesthetics of contemporary Latina artists in order to better understand the racial politics within post-nationalist movements for social justice.    Cultural Spaces of Latinidad   SCA-UA 557 4 points.   Examines the contemporary production and meanings of Latino/Hispanic identities in the United States. Looks at the spaces and institutions where this identity is produced and contested and explores how its definition has changed since it was first felt and then officially recognized by the U.S. census. Also examines representations of Latino/a identity in relation to the very real Latino/a populations that now make up the largest \"minority\" in the United States. For most of the course, explores differences and similarities in the politics of Latinidad in four important, yet not exclusive, \"spaces\" involved in the production and representation of Latinidad: the culture industries, urban politics, transnational processes, and contemporary polemics that reach the \"mainstream.\" In other words, this course is designed to theorize Latinidad, in particular \"fields of cultural production,\" whether geographic, institutional, or imaginary. Discusses students' individual research projects for the remainder of the course. Asks students to select a particular \"space\" involved in the production of Latinidad for further study. NAFTA and Narcos SCA-UA 562 Colloquium. Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines political and economic consequences of NAFTA on Mexican and U.S. foreign direct investment, industrialization, labor formation, and immigration. Traces flow of drugs, arms and profits of the drug economy, as well as relationship between rise in violence, militarization of the Americas, and changes in drug war policy in Mexico and the U.S. Considers gender dynamics of both free trade and the drug economy and critically examines the figure of the narco or drug trafficker in popular culture.    Afro-Latino Culture and History   SCA-UA 565 Offered every fall. 4 points.   Examines the profound sociological and cultural implications of the growing Afro-Latino presence in light of recent theorizing on race and diasporas. After an overview of the historical background of African-descended peoples in the Spanish-speaking Americas, we then trace the longstanding social experience of black Latinos in the United States. Along with a discussion of migration patterns and community formations, we focus on narrative accounts of Afro-Latino life and on the traditions of cultural expression. Special attention is paid to Afro-Latino poetry and to the rich history of Afro-Latino music through the generations, from rumba, mambo, and Cubop to salsa, Latin soul, and hip-hop. Finally, we turn to the possible theoretical and political consequences of this increasingly self-conscious transnational identity formation.    Caribbean Women Writers   SCA-UA 570 4 points.   Focuses on texts by Latinas of Caribbean origin whose work explores the intersections between history, gender, nation, and sexuality. Analyzing how contemporary Caribbean-origin literature by Latinas can be read as a manifestation of the complex histories of colonialism, military intervention, and political maneuverings between the United States and the Caribbean in the 20th century, the course considers the ways in which the \"tropicalized\" Latina body came to represent an insidious and seductive threat to the U.S. domestic landscape. The course addresses questions such as, What are the politics behind demeaning, fetishizing, and vilifying Latinas in the U.S. media? What role do women of Caribbean origin play in propagating, preserving, or undermining U.S. domestic life? Readings include prose, poetry, film, and music by authors and artists of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin, emphasizing the diverse ways in which Caribbean-origin Latinas affect and are affected by the United States. This course is based on students' active participation in class discussion, weekly response papers, presentations, and a research paper.    Postmodern Travel Fictions   SCA-UA 572 Offered in the spring. 4 points.   This is a study of travel narratives by post\u2013World War II authors/filmmakers of the Americas. Designed to investigate relationships existing between travel narratives and legacy of colonialism in the Americas; between the concept of \"freedom\" embodied in travel writing and the ideology of conquest engraved in historical memory; and between lost idealism of youth and melancholic romps across continents; and between literary representation and the perpetuation of racialized myths about North and South America. Emphasis on gendered dynamic of travel writing. How are notions of freedom and mobility tied to sexuality? Why do the protagonists of novels and films\u2014white, black, Latino, Asian American, or indigenous\u2014\"go West,\" South, East, or North? Why do they ping-pong among these geographic and symbolic poles? What are the evaluative meanings assigned to the cartographically given spaces these protagonists choose to visit and these authors/directors choose to revise in their novels and films?
