To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.
