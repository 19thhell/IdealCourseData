Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital Center in conjunction with the NYU School of Medicine is pleased to support the Healthcare Leadership and Administration Fellowship. Healthcare has become increasingly complex and future physician leaders should be equipped with leadership, managerial, and administrative skills to ensure that they can provide care efficiently with the highest quality. Being an effective physician is now more than delivering the highest quality clinical care; it is also being able to navigate the patient experience, medical malpractice, operations, supplies, and a host of other complex issues generally not taught in medical school. The fellowship will run from July 6, 2015 until August 14 th , 2015.   Components of the Fellowship   The goal of this fellowship is to cultivate leaders in health care. Fostering close relationships between the fellows and senior management, provides an opportunity to experience various aspects of healthcare administration, including hospital administration and finance, clinical quality and patient safety, policy-making, and clinical operations management. It is assumed that these issues will be of critical significance to a growing segment of the physician clinicians, and therefore is an important part of the undergraduate medical education experience   Curriculum   The core principles are as follows:   1. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Patient safety . Improving patient safety is the foundation of the educational curriculum. Patient safety is first priority and guides the complete curriculum.   2. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Clinical Practice . In order to contextualize the administrative meetings and lectures, 25% of the fellowship time is dedicated to clinical responsibilities. The Fellows also receive lectures dedicated to improving their clinical acumen.   3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Administration . The development of effective leaders in medicine requires a cadre of communication skills and an understanding of how business and medicine have becoming increasingly intertwined.   4. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Leadership and Professional Development. \u00a0Future leaders require skills that are often times not formally taught in medical school. The Fellowship provides lectures and workshops on leadership and professional development that help to nurture and support fellows achieve their leadership goals.   5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Advocacy. \u00a0Patient advocacy involves more than being an outstanding clinician. As such, the Fellows are exposed to how to influence legislation, governmental affairs, and healthcare policy.   6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Scholarly project . Completing a scholarly project allows the Fellows to develop a research question, search literature, design, and execute a project of interest. This also includes collaboration with senior researchers and a final presentation to the Department of Emergency Medicine.   \u00a0   Participants   Out of a large pool of qualified applicants, two outstanding medical students will be selected.\u00a0 The applicants must qualify for work-study or agree to an unpaid internship.   How to apply   Interested students must prepare (1) a one-page essay about how they feel they would benefit from the summer fellowship experience and (2) a one-page project proposal. The essays should be double-spaced in 12-point font. The project proposal can be any topic related to medical administration, leadership, health care, or the Emergency Department. Examples include operations management, patient flow, wait times in the ED, physician/patient satisfaction, improvement in patient safety and quality. A curriculum vitae is also required. These three documents (essay, project proposal, CV) should be sent by e-mail to Ellie Pena ( ellie.pena@nyumc.org ) by February 13th, 2015. Select candidates will be granted an interview and a final decision will be made by March 13th   Contacts   The Healthcare Leadership and Administration Fellowship was created and is administered by\u00a0 Tina Wu, MD , MBA, Andrew Oh, MD, and Brandon Quarles, MD.

As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member. Projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills including project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. Capstone requires students to interweave their learning in all these areas, and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment.
