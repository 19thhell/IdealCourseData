Such experience &ndash; and the perspective it engenders &ndash; is crucial to guiding students through the multi-faceted and challenging intellectual terrain of business ethics. Business and Society Program Area faculty are drawn from virtually every department at Stern and from a distinguished group of practitioners teaching as adjunct professors. Each faculty member brings to the program a unique set of skills and experiences. BSPA faculty meet frequently throughout the term to exchange ideas on the delivery of courses and to discuss current ideas, events, and legal precedents. The standard of teaching among the faculty is very high and six faculty members have won teaching awards.

Such experience &ndash; and the perspective it engenders &ndash; is crucial to guiding students through the multi-faceted and challenging intellectual terrain of business ethics. Business and Society Program Area faculty are drawn from virtually every department at Stern and from a distinguished group of practitioners teaching as adjunct professors. Each faculty member brings to the program a unique set of skills and experiences. BSPA faculty meet frequently throughout the term to exchange ideas on the delivery of courses and to discuss current ideas, events, and legal precedents. The standard of teaching among the faculty is very high and six faculty members have won teaching awards.

Paduano Faculty Research Symposium in Business Ethics, through the generous support of Daniel P. Paduano (MBA '69), was established in 2007 to create and develop an interdisciplinary research community, centered at NYU Stern but encompassing other NYU Faculties, dedicated to research in the field of Business Ethics, incorporating the highest levels of scholarship.    \u201cOur aim with this Symposium is to create a vibrant, self-sustaining community of scholars who are dedicated to unearthing substantive issues in business ethics and to advancing a research-based interdisciplinary understanding of these problems,\u201d said Dean Thomas Cooley.    Beginning in Fall 2007, the Paduano Fellows will participate in monthly seminars taught primarily by leading scholars in the field of business ethics. Paduano Fellows will be charged with integrating business ethics into their own teaching. Faculty from NYU departments, including economics, philosophy, psychology, neural science, sociology, and law; faculty visitors from other universities; and prominent practitioners will be invited to partake in these symposia and help strengthen the business ethics research community in New York City.
