work with children ages pre-school through latency. In addition to play therapy, the curriculum includes courses in child development, attachment, parenting, diagnosis of disorders of childhood, and child-focused family interventions. This course utilizes a focus on practice with children and families in a range of settings, including treatment strategies for children who have been traumatized, as well as those seen in schools and family service agencies.

The University has a long history of supporting community-based organizations and over the years a close working relationship has evolved with a number of the local child care programs.     Below is a small sampling of center-based early childhood programs on or in close proximity to the Washington Square campus. Some provide priority spaces to NYU faculty and staff.
