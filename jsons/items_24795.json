The program offers a one-year, cohort-based leadership development program for women in mid-level positions in Ghanaian civil society organizations. The program provides rich leadership development, individualized coaching and networking opportunities. GWSLP aims to provide women participants with the skills and support needed to lead transformational change in their communities and society at large.   Across Ghana\u2019s strong and vibrant civil society, women are making invaluable contributions to their country\u2019s social, economic, and political growth. However, their contributions are often underrepresented, and many lack access to positions of higher authority. The Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program offers an opportunity for mid-career women to grow as leaders, prepare themselves to take on new leadership roles and tackle pressing issues in their communities.   The program is part of\u00a0Ghana Wins!\u00a0a partnership program\u00a0delivered by New York University, that aims to strengthen the capacity of Ghanaian women as leaders in the key sectors of healthcare, education and civil society.   \u00a0   GWSLP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION   The GWSLP aims to design and deliver a leadership development curriculum, support participants in developing Action Learning Plans (ALPs) and, build a robust pipeline and network of Ghanaian women leaders.   The GWSLP aims to:   Design and deliver a Transformational Leadership Development Curriculum, including training and coaching components, for 15 women leaders per year, that enhances their leadership capabilities and prepares them for higher-level leadership roles in various civil society organizations;   Support participants in developing Action Learning Plans (ALPs) that allow women to achieve personal leadership goals, augment their project management skills and collaborate with key stakeholders as they tackle a project which will strengthen their organization and address challenges related to the environment, peace and security or gender equality; and,   Build a robust pipeline and Network of Ghanaian women leaders who become role models and incubators of leadership for other women in Ghana as they prepare themselves to lead institutions and social sector organizations.   The Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program begins with an intensive weeklong leadership development institute in Ghana that focusses on building leadership skills and strengthening core management competencies. As a central focus of the training, participants identify a pressing organizational or community need and design an action-learning project to address it.   Mid-way through the program, participants are invited to attend a leadership development institute in New York City as an opportunity to continue building robust knowledge and skills for advancing community change. The GWSLP is practice-oriented and encourages women participants to apply their learnings in their work, and culminates with a closing summit that brings together the various elements of the yearlong experience while offering an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of the year.   The program focuses on six core components; leadership institute in Ghana, action-learning projects, small group coaching,\u00a0leadership institute in New York city,\u00a0individualized assessment and feedback\u00a0and networking opportunities.

This approach examines history, literature, science and socio-cultural phenomena through the framework of women's experiences and feminist analysis.    Women's Studies is closely related to Gender Studies, Queer Studies and other approaches that place gender at the center of analysis; however, it retains its own identity based on its history and relation to feminist activism.          Women's Studies does not have its own department at NYU, but can be studied as part of the undergraduate major or minor in the Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS), which is also developing an graduate certificate program.    CSGS will merge with Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/ Pacific/ American Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies into the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis by September 2005.    The impact of this reorganization on Women's Studies needs to be monitored.      The History Department offers concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level (see more under the North American History Collection Development Policy).       Beyond these two more formalized venues, there are faculty as well as students at all levels in the humanities and social sciences who are working on women's studies topics,    so that the collections have to span the broad spectrum that is represented by CAS and GSAS. Women's Studies topics are also important in Social Work, Education and Nursing.      Altogether, the Women's Studies collections draw on and enrich almost all other subject areas, and the collection policies for other areas should be consulted as appropriate.     Contents     Purpose   Scope   Types of Materials   Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Other Resources   Subjects &amp; Collecting Levels                Purpose   The Women's Studies collections support the undergraduate major or minor in CSGS, as well as the concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level in the History Department.       Furthermore, the collections support teaching and research of women's issues on the undergraduate and graduate levels in all schools and programs of NYU, with a strong connection to    Anthropology, Sociology, Near Eastern Studies, and the ethnic and interdisciplinary studies that will make up the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis.                Scope       Language   The primary language of the collections is English. Western European languages are collected in support of the program in the History department. Non-European language materials are collected in consultation with the Asian, Near Eastern, and  Slavic studies librarians.       Geographical Areas   The geographic focus is on the Americas, Europe (including Eastern Europe), Africa, and to a lesser extent South-East Asia, esp. India, where a strong vernacular approach to women's studies has produced publications that represent Third World  voices on women's issues. Additionally, the collection supports the geographical interests of NYU teaching and research in anthropology, sociology, and literature. All other areas are collected in consultation with other subject specialist, and on an  on-need basis in consultation with teaching faculty.       Chronological Periods   All time periods are collected, with special attention given to contemporary publications and to time periods emphasized in related fields, such as History.                  Types of Materials Collected and Excluded       Formats   All formats are collected. Microform and online resources that provide primary documents, as well as audiovisual materials (esp. feature films and documentaries) are of particular interest. Small publishers and grassroots presses are selectively  acquired as important sources of feminist theory and action. The current small press plan covers many presses that are important to Women's Studies.   Conference proceedings and anthologies of previously published material are selectively purchased on topics not widely covered elsewhere.       Excluded   Generally, popular materials, such as advice and self-help books are excluded. However, some such materials may be collected very selectively as examples of current trends in social and cultural attitudes. Yankee sends slips for such popular  titles under the \"popular gender\" label directly to the women's studies/gender studies subject specialist.   Children's books, normally excluded from the collections, may be added selectively when they reflect social or cultural attitudes towards, or by, girls and women, or if they are part of the work of an important feminist author.       Related Collections in Bobst   The Tamiment/Wagner collections contain materials on US women's movement and women's involvement in US labor history, as well as anarchism and other radical movements.   The Fales Library houses the Elizabeth Robins archives, as well as materials by British and American women writers.   The US and UN government collections provide demographic and other statistical data on the status of women in America and worldwide. With more current statistical resources available online, these data are becoming more accessible to undergraduates and  interdisciplinary researchers.

The program offers a one-year, cohort-based leadership development program for women in mid-level positions in Ghanaian civil society organizations. The program provides rich leadership development, individualized coaching and networking opportunities. GWSLP aims to provide women participants with the skills and support needed to lead transformational change in their communities and society at large.   Across Ghana\u2019s strong and vibrant civil society, women are making invaluable contributions to their country\u2019s social, economic, and political growth. However, their contributions are often underrepresented, and many lack access to positions of higher authority. The Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program offers an opportunity for mid-career women to grow as leaders, prepare themselves to take on new leadership roles and tackle pressing issues in their communities.   The program is part of\u00a0Ghana Wins!\u00a0a partnership program\u00a0delivered by New York University, that aims to strengthen the capacity of Ghanaian women as leaders in the key sectors of healthcare, education and civil society.   \u00a0   GWSLP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION   The GWSLP aims to design and deliver a leadership development curriculum, support participants in developing Action Learning Plans (ALPs) and, build a robust pipeline and network of Ghanaian women leaders.   The GWSLP aims to:   Design and deliver a Transformational Leadership Development Curriculum, including training and coaching components, for 15 women leaders per year, that enhances their leadership capabilities and prepares them for higher-level leadership roles in various civil society organizations;   Support participants in developing Action Learning Plans (ALPs) that allow women to achieve personal leadership goals, augment their project management skills and collaborate with key stakeholders as they tackle a project which will strengthen their organization and address challenges related to the environment, peace and security or gender equality; and,   Build a robust pipeline and Network of Ghanaian women leaders who become role models and incubators of leadership for other women in Ghana as they prepare themselves to lead institutions and social sector organizations.   The Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program begins with an intensive weeklong leadership development institute in Ghana that focusses on building leadership skills and strengthening core management competencies. As a central focus of the training, participants identify a pressing organizational or community need and design an action-learning project to address it.   Mid-way through the program, participants are invited to attend a leadership development institute in New York City as an opportunity to continue building robust knowledge and skills for advancing community change. The GWSLP is practice-oriented and encourages women participants to apply their learnings in their work, and culminates with a closing summit that brings together the various elements of the yearlong experience while offering an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of the year.   The program focuses on six core components; leadership institute in Ghana, action-learning projects, small group coaching,\u00a0leadership institute in New York city,\u00a0individualized assessment and feedback\u00a0and networking opportunities.                   Program Staff     Amparo Hofmann-Pinilla   Program Director and RCLA Deputy Director Bio   NEWS AND UPDATES   March 16 - March 21, 2015    The\u00a0Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program conducted the leadership training institute in Ghana with the second cohort, who were welcomed in January 2015. The training was facilitated by\u00a0leadership development experts and civil society\u00a0leaders,\u00a0practitioners and faculty from NYU Wagner, the University of Ghana, Skills Sharing Consult\u00a0and Axis Human Capital Limited. The training\u00a0focussed on understanding leadership in the Ghanaian context; adressed African women, Gender, and leadership; introduced management skills, conflict resolution, communicaions and public speaking; and, examined anti-corruption as an ecosystem.  \u00a0   January 17, 2015     The \"2015 Graduation ceremony\" acknowledged\u00a0the accomplishments of 15 exceptional Ghanaian women leaders who were\u00a0part of the first cohort of the program. These women\u00a0developed their leadership skills through coaching and training, and\u00a0developed Action Lerning projects that address\u00a0critical\u00a0community\u00a0needs in Ghana. The program also\u00a0welcomed the\u00a0second cohort, with\u00a015 Ghanaian women,\u00a0selected to train and develop skills\u00a0to\u00a0further support\u00a0leadership and transformational change in Ghana.\u00a0  \u00a0   \u00a0  \u00a0                                                                            NYU.edu   \u00a9 NYU Wagner\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0212.998.7400\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Copyright and Fair Use \u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Contact Us"}, {"content": "New York University | Bobst Library: Women's Studies Collection Development Policy                                                                                             Search           Search:                BobCat        BobCat Standard        Archival Collections        HSLCat (NYU Medical)        Julius (NYU Law)            Search This Site            WorldCat        CATNYP (NYPL)        CLIO (Columbia University)                Google Books        Google Scholar        Amazon.com                                                                              Home    Find Resources        Articles and Databases   Books &amp; More via BobCat    Call Number & Floor Maps     ebooks   Images   Journals    Special Collections/Archives   Videos &amp; Music   Virtual Business Library   Other Catalogs           Research Assistance        Ask a Librarian   Citation Tools   Data Services   Digital Scholarship   Digital Studio   Library Classes   QuickRef   Request an appointment   Research &amp; How-To Guides   Subject Librarians   Tutorials           Services        Borrow &amp; Request   Computing   Course Reserves   Disability Services   Faculty Services   Global Services   Graduate Student Services   Interlibrary Loan (ILL)   Print, Copy, Scan   Services A-Z   Study Spaces   Suggest a Purchase   Alumni &amp; Friends           About        About NYU Libraries   Career Opportunities   General Information   Giving to the Libraries   Hours &amp; Access   Library Locations   Library Policies   NYU Press   Staff Directory   What's New           Help             Ask a Librarian   FAQs   Library Classes   Research Guides   Search this Site   Subject Librarians                          Find Resources        Articles and Databases   Books &amp; More via BobCat    Call Number & Floor Maps     ebooks   Images   Journals    Special Collections/Archives   Videos &amp; Music   Virtual Business Library   Other Catalogs                      Women's Studies Collection Development Policy         Bobst Library, New York University      Jason Phillips , Librarian for Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies       Women's Studies is an interdisciplinary approach to scholarship grounded in feminist theory.    This approach examines history, literature, science and socio-cultural phenomena through the framework of women's experiences and feminist analysis.    Women's Studies is closely related to Gender Studies, Queer Studies and other approaches that place gender at the center of analysis; however, it retains its own identity based on its history and relation to feminist activism.          Women's Studies does not have its own department at NYU, but can be studied as part of the undergraduate major or minor in the Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS), which is also developing an graduate certificate program.    CSGS will merge with Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/ Pacific/ American Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies into the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis by September 2005.    The impact of this reorganization on Women's Studies needs to be monitored.      The History Department offers concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level (see more under the North American History Collection Development Policy).       Beyond these two more formalized venues, there are faculty as well as students at all levels in the humanities and social sciences who are working on women's studies topics,    so that the collections have to span the broad spectrum that is represented by CAS and GSAS. Women's Studies topics are also important in Social Work, Education and Nursing.      Altogether, the Women's Studies collections draw on and enrich almost all other subject areas, and the collection policies for other areas should be consulted as appropriate.     Contents     Purpose   Scope   Types of Materials   Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Other Resources   Subjects &amp; Collecting Levels                Purpose   The Women's Studies collections support the undergraduate major or minor in CSGS, as well as the concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level in the History Department.       Furthermore, the collections support teaching and research of women's issues on the undergraduate and graduate levels in all schools and programs of NYU, with a strong connection to    Anthropology, Sociology, Near Eastern Studies, and the ethnic and interdisciplinary studies that will make up the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis.                Scope       Language   The primary language of the collections is English. Western European languages are collected in support of the program in the History department. Non-European language materials are collected in consultation with the Asian, Near Eastern, and  Slavic studies librarians.       Geographical Areas   The geographic focus is on the Americas, Europe (including Eastern Europe), Africa, and to a lesser extent South-East Asia, esp. India, where a strong vernacular approach to women's studies has produced publications that represent Third World  voices on women's issues. Additionally, the collection supports the geographical interests of NYU teaching and research in anthropology, sociology, and literature. All other areas are collected in consultation with other subject specialist, and on an  on-need basis in consultation with teaching faculty.       Chronological Periods   All time periods are collected, with special attention given to contemporary publications and to time periods emphasized in related fields, such as History.                  Types of Materials Collected and Excluded       Formats   All formats are collected. Microform and online resources that provide primary documents, as well as audiovisual materials (esp. feature films and documentaries) are of particular interest. Small publishers and grassroots presses are selectively  acquired as important sources of feminist theory and action. The current small press plan covers many presses that are important to Women's Studies.   Conference proceedings and anthologies of previously published material are selectively purchased on topics not widely covered elsewhere.       Excluded   Generally, popular materials, such as advice and self-help books are excluded. However, some such materials may be collected very selectively as examples of current trends in social and cultural attitudes. Yankee sends slips for such popular  titles under the \"popular gender\" label directly to the women's studies/gender studies subject specialist.   Children's books, normally excluded from the collections, may be added selectively when they reflect social or cultural attitudes towards, or by, girls and women, or if they are part of the work of an important feminist author.       Related Collections in Bobst   The Tamiment/Wagner collections contain materials on US women's movement and women's involvement in US labor history, as well as anarchism and other radical movements.   The Fales Library houses the Elizabeth Robins archives, as well as materials by British and American women writers.   The US and UN government collections provide demographic and other statistical data on the status of women in America and worldwide. With more current statistical resources available online, these data are becoming more accessible to undergraduates and  interdisciplinary researchers.

GWSLP aims to provide women participants with the skills and support needed to lead transformational change in their communities and society at large.   Across Ghana\u2019s strong and vibrant civil society, women are making invaluable contributions to their country\u2019s social, economic, and political growth. However, their contributions are often underrepresented, and many lack access to positions of higher authority.

The GWSLP aims to:   Design and deliver a Transformational Leadership Development Curriculum, including training and coaching components, for 15 women leaders per year, that enhances their leadership capabilities and prepares them for higher-level leadership roles in various civil society organizations;   Support participants in developing Action Learning Plans (ALPs) that allow women to achieve personal leadership goals, augment their project management skills and collaborate with key stakeholders as they tackle a project which will strengthen their organization and address challenges related to the environment, peace and security or gender equality; and,   Build a robust pipeline and Network of Ghanaian women leaders who become role models and incubators of leadership for other women in Ghana as they prepare themselves to lead institutions and social sector organizations.   The Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program begins with an intensive weeklong leadership development institute in Ghana that focusses on building leadership skills and strengthening core management competencies. As a central focus of the training, participants identify a pressing organizational or community need and design an action-learning project to address it.   Mid-way through the program, participants are invited to attend a leadership development institute in New York City as an opportunity to continue building robust knowledge and skills for advancing community change. The GWSLP is practice-oriented and encourages women participants to apply their learnings in their work, and culminates with a closing summit that brings together the various elements of the yearlong experience while offering an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of the year.

This approach examines history, literature, science and socio-cultural phenomena through the framework of women's experiences and feminist analysis.    Women's Studies is closely related to Gender Studies, Queer Studies and other approaches that place gender at the center of analysis; however, it retains its own identity based on its history and relation to feminist activism.          Women's Studies does not have its own department at NYU, but can be studied as part of the undergraduate major or minor in the Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS), which is also developing an graduate certificate program.    CSGS will merge with Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/ Pacific/ American Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies into the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis by September 2005.    The impact of this reorganization on Women's Studies needs to be monitored.      The History Department offers concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level (see more under the North American History Collection Development Policy).       Beyond these two more formalized venues, there are faculty as well as students at all levels in the humanities and social sciences who are working on women's studies topics,    so that the collections have to span the broad spectrum that is represented by CAS and GSAS. Women's Studies topics are also important in Social Work, Education and Nursing.      Altogether, the Women's Studies collections draw on and enrich almost all other subject areas, and the collection policies for other areas should be consulted as appropriate.     Contents     Purpose   Scope   Types of Materials   Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Other Resources   Subjects &amp; Collecting Levels                Purpose   The Women's Studies collections support the undergraduate major or minor in CSGS, as well as the concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level in the History Department.       Furthermore, the collections support teaching and research of women's issues on the undergraduate and graduate levels in all schools and programs of NYU, with a strong connection to    Anthropology, Sociology, Near Eastern Studies, and the ethnic and interdisciplinary studies that will make up the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis.                Scope       Language   The primary language of the collections is English. Western European languages are collected in support of the program in the History department. Non-European language materials are collected in consultation with the Asian, Near Eastern, and  Slavic studies librarians.       Geographical Areas   The geographic focus is on the Americas, Europe (including Eastern Europe), Africa, and to a lesser extent South-East Asia, esp. India, where a strong vernacular approach to women's studies has produced publications that represent Third World  voices on women's issues. Additionally, the collection supports the geographical interests of NYU teaching and research in anthropology, sociology, and literature. All other areas are collected in consultation with other subject specialist, and on an  on-need basis in consultation with teaching faculty.       Chronological Periods   All time periods are collected, with special attention given to contemporary publications and to time periods emphasized in related fields, such as History.                  Types of Materials Collected and Excluded       Formats   All formats are collected. Microform and online resources that provide primary documents, as well as audiovisual materials (esp. feature films and documentaries) are of particular interest. Small publishers and grassroots presses are selectively  acquired as important sources of feminist theory and action. The current small press plan covers many presses that are important to Women's Studies.   Conference proceedings and anthologies of previously published material are selectively purchased on topics not widely covered elsewhere.       Excluded   Generally, popular materials, such as advice and self-help books are excluded. However, some such materials may be collected very selectively as examples of current trends in social and cultural attitudes. Yankee sends slips for such popular  titles under the \"popular gender\" label directly to the women's studies/gender studies subject specialist.   Children's books, normally excluded from the collections, may be added selectively when they reflect social or cultural attitudes towards, or by, girls and women, or if they are part of the work of an important feminist author.       Related Collections in Bobst   The Tamiment/Wagner collections contain materials on US women's movement and women's involvement in US labor history, as well as anarchism and other radical movements.   The Fales Library houses the Elizabeth Robins archives, as well as materials by British and American women writers.   The US and UN government collections provide demographic and other statistical data on the status of women in America and worldwide. With more current statistical resources available online, these data are becoming more accessible to undergraduates and  interdisciplinary researchers.

The Native Studies Forum   The Native Studies Forum is an organization founded at New York University to fuild a community of faculty, students, staff, and community members concerned with historical, political, and cultural matters related to Native Americans and indigenous people.          Scholars at Risk Network   Hosted by New York University, The Scholars at Risk Network (SAR) is an international network of universities and colleges responding to attacks on scholars because of their words, their ideas and their place in society. SAR promotes academic freedom and defends the human rights of scholars and their communities worldwide.          NYU Women's Leadership Forum     The NYU Women's Forum concept originated in 2005 when national attention put the role, function, and challenges facing women in the academy into the spotlight. From the controversial debate about why relatively few women pursue and flourish in the sciences, to reports about the persistence of the glass ceiling in the academy and elsewhere in society, to the work/family collision course encountered by many women striving to achieve both a successful career and a home life of acceptable quality - the time seemed right for NYU to reflect upon and examine itself in that context.   The objective of the NYU Women's Leadership Forum is to foster leadership development, facilitate professional growth, and sponsor opportunities for outreach among women in leadership roles. It is expected that these efforts will create new and exciting ways for women at NYU to take part in the vibrant life of the University. Through professional and personal networking, access to electronic resources and materials, and participation in an array of events such as conferences, guest presentations, and opportunities for professional development, women can exchange information and interact with others who have common interests and goals. The Founding Chair of the NYU Women's Leadership is NYU Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President Diane Yu, with staff support from the Office of the President.

The program offers a one-year, cohort-based leadership development program for women in mid-level positions in Ghanaian civil society organizations. The program provides rich leadership development, individualized coaching and networking opportunities. GWSLP aims to provide women participants with the skills and support needed to lead transformational change in their communities and society at large.   Across Ghana\u2019s strong and vibrant civil society, women are making invaluable contributions to their country\u2019s social, economic, and political growth. However, their contributions are often underrepresented, and many lack access to positions of higher authority. The Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program offers an opportunity for mid-career women to grow as leaders, prepare themselves to take on new leadership roles and tackle pressing issues in their communities.   The program is part of\u00a0Ghana Wins!\u00a0a partnership program\u00a0delivered by New York University, that aims to strengthen the capacity of Ghanaian women as leaders in the key sectors of healthcare, education and civil society.   \u00a0   GWSLP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION   The GWSLP aims to design and deliver a leadership development curriculum, support participants in developing Action Learning Plans (ALPs) and, build a robust pipeline and network of Ghanaian women leaders.   The GWSLP aims to:   Design and deliver a Transformational Leadership Development Curriculum, including training and coaching components, for 15 women leaders per year, that enhances their leadership capabilities and prepares them for higher-level leadership roles in various civil society organizations;   Support participants in developing Action Learning Plans (ALPs) that allow women to achieve personal leadership goals, augment their project management skills and collaborate with key stakeholders as they tackle a project which will strengthen their organization and address challenges related to the environment, peace and security or gender equality; and,   Build a robust pipeline and Network of Ghanaian women leaders who become role models and incubators of leadership for other women in Ghana as they prepare themselves to lead institutions and social sector organizations.   The Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program begins with an intensive weeklong leadership development institute in Ghana that focusses on building leadership skills and strengthening core management competencies. As a central focus of the training, participants identify a pressing organizational or community need and design an action-learning project to address it.   Mid-way through the program, participants are invited to attend a leadership development institute in New York City as an opportunity to continue building robust knowledge and skills for advancing community change. The GWSLP is practice-oriented and encourages women participants to apply their learnings in their work, and culminates with a closing summit that brings together the various elements of the yearlong experience while offering an opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of the year.   The program focuses on six core components; leadership institute in Ghana, action-learning projects, small group coaching,\u00a0leadership institute in New York city,\u00a0individualized assessment and feedback\u00a0and networking opportunities.                   Program Staff     Amparo Hofmann-Pinilla   Program Director and RCLA Deputy Director Bio   NEWS AND UPDATES   March 16 - March 21, 2015    The\u00a0Ghanaian Women\u2019s Social Leadership Program conducted the leadership training institute in Ghana with the second cohort, who were welcomed in January 2015. The training was facilitated by\u00a0leadership development experts and civil society\u00a0leaders,\u00a0practitioners and faculty from NYU Wagner, the University of Ghana, Skills Sharing Consult\u00a0and Axis Human Capital Limited. The training\u00a0focussed on understanding leadership in the Ghanaian context; adressed African women, Gender, and leadership; introduced management skills, conflict resolution, communicaions and public speaking; and, examined anti-corruption as an ecosystem.  \u00a0   January 17, 2015     The \"2015 Graduation ceremony\" acknowledged\u00a0the accomplishments of 15 exceptional Ghanaian women leaders who were\u00a0part of the first cohort of the program. These women\u00a0developed their leadership skills through coaching and training, and\u00a0developed Action Lerning projects that address\u00a0critical\u00a0community\u00a0needs in Ghana.

This approach examines history, literature, science and socio-cultural phenomena through the framework of women's experiences and feminist analysis.    Women's Studies is closely related to Gender Studies, Queer Studies and other approaches that place gender at the center of analysis; however, it retains its own identity based on its history and relation to feminist activism.          Women's Studies does not have its own department at NYU, but can be studied as part of the undergraduate major or minor in the Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS), which is also developing an graduate certificate program.    CSGS will merge with Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/ Pacific/ American Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies into the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis by September 2005.    The impact of this reorganization on Women's Studies needs to be monitored.      The History Department offers concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level (see more under the North American History Collection Development Policy).       Beyond these two more formalized venues, there are faculty as well as students at all levels in the humanities and social sciences who are working on women's studies topics,    so that the collections have to span the broad spectrum that is represented by CAS and GSAS. Women's Studies topics are also important in Social Work, Education and Nursing.      Altogether, the Women's Studies collections draw on and enrich almost all other subject areas, and the collection policies for other areas should be consulted as appropriate.     Contents     Purpose   Scope   Types of Materials   Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Other Resources   Subjects &amp; Collecting Levels                Purpose   The Women's Studies collections support the undergraduate major or minor in CSGS, as well as the concentrations in women's history at the master's and doctoral level in the History Department.       Furthermore, the collections support teaching and research of women's issues on the undergraduate and graduate levels in all schools and programs of NYU, with a strong connection to    Anthropology, Sociology, Near Eastern Studies, and the ethnic and interdisciplinary studies that will make up the new Department of Social and Cultural Analysis.                Scope       Language   The primary language of the collections is English. Western European languages are collected in support of the program in the History department. Non-European language materials are collected in consultation with the Asian, Near Eastern, and  Slavic studies librarians.       Geographical Areas   The geographic focus is on the Americas, Europe (including Eastern Europe), Africa, and to a lesser extent South-East Asia, esp. India, where a strong vernacular approach to women's studies has produced publications that represent Third World  voices on women's issues. Additionally, the collection supports the geographical interests of NYU teaching and research in anthropology, sociology, and literature. All other areas are collected in consultation with other subject specialist, and on an  on-need basis in consultation with teaching faculty.       Chronological Periods   All time periods are collected, with special attention given to contemporary publications and to time periods emphasized in related fields, such as History.                  Types of Materials Collected and Excluded       Formats   All formats are collected. Microform and online resources that provide primary documents, as well as audiovisual materials (esp. feature films and documentaries) are of particular interest. Small publishers and grassroots presses are selectively  acquired as important sources of feminist theory and action. The current small press plan covers many presses that are important to Women's Studies.   Conference proceedings and anthologies of previously published material are selectively purchased on topics not widely covered elsewhere.       Excluded   Generally, popular materials, such as advice and self-help books are excluded. However, some such materials may be collected very selectively as examples of current trends in social and cultural attitudes. Yankee sends slips for such popular  titles under the \"popular gender\" label directly to the women's studies/gender studies subject specialist.   Children's books, normally excluded from the collections, may be added selectively when they reflect social or cultural attitudes towards, or by, girls and women, or if they are part of the work of an important feminist author.       Related Collections in Bobst   The Tamiment/Wagner collections contain materials on US women's movement and women's involvement in US labor history, as well as anarchism and other radical movements.   The Fales Library houses the Elizabeth Robins archives, as well as materials by British and American women writers.   The US and UN government collections provide demographic and other statistical data on the status of women in America and worldwide. With more current statistical resources available online, these data are becoming more accessible to undergraduates and  interdisciplinary researchers.

The Native Studies Forum   The Native Studies Forum is an organization founded at New York University to fuild a community of faculty, students, staff, and community members concerned with historical, political, and cultural matters related to Native Americans and indigenous people.          Scholars at Risk Network   Hosted by New York University, The Scholars at Risk Network (SAR) is an international network of universities and colleges responding to attacks on scholars because of their words, their ideas and their place in society. SAR promotes academic freedom and defends the human rights of scholars and their communities worldwide.          NYU Women's Leadership Forum     The NYU Women's Forum concept originated in 2005 when national attention put the role, function, and challenges facing women in the academy into the spotlight. From the controversial debate about why relatively few women pursue and flourish in the sciences, to reports about the persistence of the glass ceiling in the academy and elsewhere in society, to the work/family collision course encountered by many women striving to achieve both a successful career and a home life of acceptable quality - the time seemed right for NYU to reflect upon and examine itself in that context.   The objective of the NYU Women's Leadership Forum is to foster leadership development, facilitate professional growth, and sponsor opportunities for outreach among women in leadership roles. It is expected that these efforts will create new and exciting ways for women at NYU to take part in the vibrant life of the University. Through professional and personal networking, access to electronic resources and materials, and participation in an array of events such as conferences, guest presentations, and opportunities for professional development, women can exchange information and interact with others who have common interests and goals. The Founding Chair of the NYU Women's Leadership is NYU Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President Diane Yu, with staff support from the Office of the President.
