This list will be updated as more courses are reviewed and approved. Please note that course numbers and titles may change.   To search for Gallatin courses that fulfill the Foundation Requirement (liberal arts and historical and cultural requirements), go to the Gallatin Courses page . Please note that individualized projects (i.e. independent studies, tutorials, etc.) do not fulfill any area of the foundation requirement.     Most courses on the list below were offered in prior semesters and may or may not be offered in a future semester. Students should consult the Albert Course Search to see when these courses are offered.   Special Topics courses may in some cases satisfy Gallatin's historical and cultural foundation requirement, but must be considered on a case-by-case basis.To request the review of a Special Topics course, students should complete a Foundation Requirement Petition form .     To request that a new course be reviewed to fulfill one of the foundation requirements, students should complete a Foundation Requirement Petition form .

Is it something external to us as human beings, or are we   part of it? Are there particular ethical, religious, economic, or   political considerations that should structure or determine our   relationship with nature? How has the concept of nature been articulated   by thinkers in the Western tradition from Plato to Earth First! founder   Dave Foreman? Examining such questions in historical and cultural   perspective, we consider competing ideas about humanity\u2019s relationship   to nature through seminal works theorizing the relationship between the   individual and nature, society and nature, and the definition of nature.   Readings: Plato\u2019s Timaeus; Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Descartes\u2019   Discourse on Method; Hobbes\u2019 Leviathan; Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on   Inequality; Leopold\u2019s Sand County Almanac; Carson\u2019s Silent Spring;   Foreman\u2019s Rewilding America; essays by Cronon, Thomas, Walker, and   Worster; selections from Aquinas, Francis Bacon, Marx, Thoreau, and   Emerson. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Arts and Publics Prof. Blake (English)  syllabus * Civic   values and public purpose are intricately bound up with the arts.   Whenever a case needs to be made that the arts matter, we tend to speak   (usually, in very general terms) about how the arts contribute to   education, or self-expression, or community life, or public   deliberation, or the moral and social reform of individuals and   institutions. On the other side, those who question the public value of   the arts might complain that the arts are elitist, or overweening, or   out of touch, or too political, or not political enough. How did we come   to think about the arts in these terms? What are some of our   assumptions about public life, such that it makes sense for us to   promote the arts as having an important public cultural role, or   alternatively distrust or dismiss them for not properly or effectively   living up to that role? And, ultimately, what is at stake: Why does it   matter if the arts matter? Readings from the Classical period through   the present day, with a specific focus on drama and theatre.  FALL 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Visible and Invisible Cities Prof. Cox (Italian Studies)  syllabus * The   experience of living in a city is one vital thread that connects us   with our ancient, medieval, and early modern ancestors, and that   continues to provide a unifying element in millions of our   contemporaries\u2019 disparate lives across the globe. Urban life is a   constant environment and stimulus, whether you find yourself in New   York, Florence, Accra, or Shanghai. Our aim is to supply conceptual   frameworks and historical contexts for this experience by exploring the   ways human communities have been theorized and imagined within the   Western tradition from classical antiquity through to the Renaissance,   particularly the city, conceived since Aristotle as the proper habitat   of humankind, and the relationship between the family or household and   the state. The primary texts encompass utopian writings and works of   political theory, but also texts describing and analyzing real-world   communities and visual and cartographic representations of cities and   urban space. Readings include the canonical\u2014from Plato, Aristotle,   Vergil, Dante, Boccaccio, More, Shakespeare\u2014to texts from Christine de   Pizan and Moderata Fontelong, marginalized from the canon and only now   becoming visible.  FALL 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus*  \"One   might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its   effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter   Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the   line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what   consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts   like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between   the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in   literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings,   films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them   from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in   essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis,   Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses,   Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's   Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond   Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and   Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\"   selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Value Prof. Poovey (English) &amp; Prof. Zaloom (Social and Cultural Analysis)  syllabus * Can   you put a price on sex? art? love? life? Is time money, or is   daydreaming time well-spent? Would you accept a pound of flesh as   payment of a debt? Is there such a thing as a free lunch, and what would   it taste like? We explore different\u2014and often conflicting\u2014conceptions   of value spanning literature, philosophy, ethnography, and social   theory, seeking to convey three fundamental principles: Value is not   inherent in things but the result of a social process, value is often   determined at the intersection of different conceptions of productive   potential, and value is conceptualized or measured in different, and   often conflicting, ways. Readings include selections from Aristotle,   Christian Scripture, Shakespeare, Smith, Bentham, Wordsworth, Austen,   Weber, Keynes, Milton Friedman, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Pierre Bourdieu. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Democracy,  Knowledge, and Equality Prof. Schwartzberg (Politics)  syllabus* Introduces students to classic works both defending and criticizing democracy, asking how we should characterize equality among democratic citizens, and whether this equality hinders or helps us to produce knowledge and to make wise decisions. Beginning with democracy in ancient Athens and key works of Greek political thought, we move to classics of modern political thought, focusing on questions of representation, deliberation, and expertise, concluding with the implications of these arguments for racial inequality in the United States and the argument for the importance of racial integration as a means both of realizing racial equality and of improving the quality of democratic decision-making. Readings: Aristophanes' Wasps, Plato's Protagoras and Republic, Aristotle's Politics, Rousseau's Second Discourse and Social Contract, Tocqueville's Democracy in America, DuBois\u2019 Souls of Black Folk, Anderson\u2019s Imperative of Integration, selections from Mill, Dewey, and Hayek.  FALL 2015 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Antiquity and the Reformation Prof. M. Smith (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus * Often viewed as a series of \"Protestant\" responses to the Roman Catholic Church, the Reformation was a period of massive religious and political conflict. It appropriated the Bible as the single basis of authoritative knowledge and also transformed the study of the Bible based on the language and textual scholarship that had emerged in the wake of the Renaissance\u2019s rediscovery of classical texts. In taking up the Bible as well as classical learning, the Reformation posed fundamental questions about the nature of individual persons, society, and humanity. These issues continue to inform fundamental ideas and conceptual categories of religion and society in Western Europe and the United States today. We focus on three sets of interrelated questions of the authors and works that we read: What is the nature of human beings? What is the nature of society as experienced and the model society? How do individuals and societies learn the answers to these questions? Readings include: Hebrew Scriptures and Christian New Testament; Plato\u2019s Republic; Vergil\u2019s Aeneid; More\u2019s Utopia; selections from Augustine, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin.  FALL 2015 CORE-UA 402, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissanc e Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus * What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way.  FALL 2015 CORE-UA 402, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissanc e Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus * The   \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the   \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it   also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece   and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of   crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the   \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at   antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture   between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant   with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's   Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts,   John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier;   Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays;   More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 403, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys (French)  syllabus* The   Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects   of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting,   music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The   Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that   would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious,   political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today   to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts   that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and   the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of   nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy,   of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in   history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but   also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates   at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution,   which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born   free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus,   Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's   Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and   Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute   and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" FALL 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)  syllabus Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can\u2014or should\u2014an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey\u2014but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people\u2019s moral judgements differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study includes Richard Wagner\u2019s remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings include selections from the Hebrew Scriptures and Christian New Testament, Homer\u2019s Iliad, Sophocles\u2019 Antigone, Plato\u2019s Gorgias, Vergil\u2019s Aeneid, poetry by (among others) Tennyson and Matthew Arnold, Arnold\u2019s Culture and Anarchy, Wagner\u2019s Art and Revolution, Nietzsche\u2019s Genealogy of Morality. FALL 2015 CORE-UA 404, Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)  syllabus * Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents.  Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus  Spring 2016 SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Life and Law Prof. Frey (German)  syllabus Who decides over life and death? On what basis are people\u2019s actions judged and punished? The notion that we should be governed \u201cby laws and not by men\u201d goes back to ancient Greece\u2014but also the idea that there are always exceptional cases that only a judge or sovereign can take into account. The law that coldly condemns is blind to the individual circumstances, feelings, and stories that make up \u201clife.\u201d How have philosophy and literature negotiated the tension between law and life from Greek antiquity to the present? How does the messy richness of life relate to the orderliness of law? When does law serve life, and when does it restrict it, oppose it, kill it? Is law humane or inhuman?

SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Scenes of Instruction Prof. Garcia (Comparative Literature)  syllabus * Scenes of instruction, from the imparting of knowledge or skills to the idea of a direction, an order, or a mandate. What does it mean to offer, seek, follow, or refuse instruction? What figures show up in scenes of instruction, and what personas emerge from them? If mechanisms and venues of instruction proliferate today, whether in the form of fitness drills, how-to videos, flash mobs, or MOOCS, in what ways can the literatures of the past provide assistance in navigating the promises and hazards of instruction? We explore texts that enact instruction or else bring some version of it into representation. How do texts imbue their lessons, advice and directives with urgency? What desires collect around instruction? What is the relationship of instruction to subjection? More basically, what counts as valid instruction in different historical epochs and what imperatives drive individuals to secure or elude it? Readings include: Yoga Sutras Attributed to Patanjali, Plato's Apology, Euripides' Iphigenia Among the Taurians, Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Nietzsche's Untimely Mediations, Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, Isherwood's My Guru and His Disciple, Ishiguro's Never Let Me Go. SPRING 2016 CORE -UA 400, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Utopias and Distopias Prof. Kotsonis (Russian and Slavic Studies) syllabus * Considers   how writers and other artists over the past two millennia have imagined   perfect and just societies and, more recently, how they imagined   perfectly unjust and nightmarish societies and implied what would   restore them. Readings: Plato\u2019s Republic, Xenophon\u2019s Anabasis, More\u2019s   Utopia, Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto,   Wells\u2019 Time Machine, Bellamy\u2019s Looking Backward, Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle,   Zamiatin\u2019s We, Bulgakov\u2019s Heart of a Dog, Huxley\u2019s Brave New World,   Orwell\u2019s 1984.

What are we doing when we do something?   The term \u201caction\u201d covers everything from picking up a pencil to leading   a political revolution. Action is a way of intervening in the world and   changing it, in minor or major ways. Both ethics and politics involve   acting in relation to others. Philosophers have found action interesting   because it bridges the mental and physical worlds, beginning as   intention and ending with some sort of embodied execution. The English   word \u201cact\u201d complicates things still further, since it can mean not only   \u201cto do something\u201d but also \u201cto pretend to do something; to play a part.\u201d   Acting in the \u201cserious\u201d sense is always haunted by dramatic or   play-acting. And because drama is the art form that relies on people   actually doing things onstage\u2014or rather, pretending to actually do   things onstage\u2014it is also an art form that has thought through questions   of action in sophisticated ways. We read a variety of works by   philosophers, playwrights, theologians, filmmakers, and economists in   order to get a sense of how action has been understood from the   classical era to the present day, including Aeschylus, Aristotle,   Augustine, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Smith, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Beckett. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas : Topics\u2014Violence and Non-Violence Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The twentieth century was the bloodiest century in history. It witnessed two world wars and countless local and regional conflicts. The twenty first century began with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Since then the world has been engulfed in an endless cycle of terrorism and war that seems only to be getting more violent and ruthless. And yet, in contrast to previous periods of history, we live in an era of unprecedented peace. The twentieth century gave rise to many of the most successful non-violent protest movements. War kills fewer people; violent crime has dropped to record lows; individual rights are more common than ever across the globe. We explore how different texts and their authors imagine the role of violence and non-violence in the world, beginning in the ancient world and tracing the competing realities of violence and non-violence into the modern age, and investigating what factors legitimize warfare, why some societies or individuals violent or non-violent, and how different societies or individuals define violence. Particular emphasis is placed on how writers utilize religion to promote violence or advocate for non-violence. Reading are drawn from a wide selection of ancient and medieval Jewish, Christian, and Muslim texts alongside the depictions of war and violence in the classical writings of Homer and Vergil, and memoirs of the Holocaust and Rwandan genocide, war literature, prison narratives, and the writings of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.  SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)  syllabus * According   to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships   with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives   them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether   non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether   they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the   outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we   examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as   if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us,   as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents   ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the   premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries),   reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current   examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories),   some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials   from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role   of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic   works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this   sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Medieval Political Thought Prof. Stoller (NYU Libraries)  syllabus * Medieval   political thought spanned three great religious traditions:   Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Across all three traditions it was   grounded in a deeply religious perspective on the human condition, one   originating in a set of sacred texts that shared a common monotheism and   a similar moral ethic. The political thought of all three groups was   equally grounded in a set of ancient, pagan texts, drawing on the   perspective of the Greeks and Romans, on whose shoulders the medievals   believed they stood. Political theorists across all three traditions   drew heavily from one another, but each spoke to the unique concerns of   its own community. We explore the commonalities and the contrasts among   the three political systems and the extraordinary minds that shaped   them. Readings will include Hebrew and Christian scriptures, the Qur'an,   Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Alfarabi, Alghazali, Aquinas, Avicenna,   Bacon, Giles of Rome, Maimonides, Marsilius of Padua, and Polgar. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 400,  Topics\u2014Life and Death Prof. Velleman (Philosophy)  syllabus * Every   person has a life to live, but what is this thing, \u201ca life\u201d, that every   person has? To begin with, it\u2019s just the temporally extended existence   of the person, the proverbial three score and ten. But a person\u2019s life   is more than that, because it follows a natural progression of   life-stages, from childhood to adolescence to middle age to senescence.   And it\u2019s even more still, since it is partly the creation of the person   living it, who can plan it, evaluate it, anticipate its future, and   remember its past. We explore these and other aspects of a person\u2019s life   through works of literature and philosophy. What makes you the same   person throughout the different stages of your life? How does the   passage of time color your perception of life? What makes for a good   life? A meaningful life? Should you be grateful for having been born, or   dismayed at having to die? Readings: Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics,   Epicurus\u2019 \u201cLetter to Menoeceus,\u201d Cicero\u2019s De Finibus, Lucretius De Rerum   Natura, Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations, Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cA Confession\u201d and   \u201cDeath of Ivan Ilych,\u201d Kertesz\u2019 Kaddish for an Unborn Child, Kafka\u2019s   Metamorphosis, McCullers\u2019 Member of the Wedding, Vonnegut\u2019s   Slaughterhouse-Five. SPRING 2016 CORE-UA 400, Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus * What   is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum   freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom,   slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to   Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical   and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas   around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read   seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the   collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary   nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in   Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles   and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian   and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the   Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of   liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s   Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s   On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s   Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the   Oppressed.
