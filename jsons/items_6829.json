Vitae                              Areas of Expertise       Mental health services, recovery, person-centered care, case management, primary and behavioral healthcare integration, and mental health policy                         Biography     Dr. Victoria Stanhope is an assistant professor at the NYU Silver School of Social Work. She received her PhD in social welfare from the University of Pennsylvania and her Master\u2019s in Social Work from the University of Pittsburgh. Her professional interests are in mental health services research and policy. Her areas of specialization are recovery, person-centered care, case management, and primary and behavioral healthcare integration. Her research has been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.   Dr. Stanhope\u2019s teaching area is in social welfare policy and research methods. She has taught courses as an adjunct faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania and LaSalle University. She practiced as a social worker in community-based mental health providing case management services to people with severe mental illnesses. Her clinical focus was on social skills training and implementing dialectical behavioral therapy in case management settings.   Prior to her social work career, Dr. Stanhope has eight years policy experience working in Washington, DC. She received an MA in public policy from The George Washington University and worked as an advocate for school psychologists in the areas of mental health, heath care, and diversity issues. She participated in national coalitions of public interest organizations lobbying Congress and the administration on issues related to health care reform, welfare reform, and mental health parity.     Her primary research focus has been provider-consumer relationships and how they impact the implementation of evidence-based practices, service engagement, and client outcomes. The context for this research has been the mental health recovery movement, which has made service choice, person-centered care, and shared decision making a cornerstone of mental health reform. The aim of her research is to understand how providers can enter into meaningful partnerships with their clients to improve outcomes and to use this knowledge to develop interventions that give providers the knowledge, skills, tools, and organizational support to pursue these partnerships in diverse and complex service settings.

Vitae                              Areas of Expertise       Mental health services, recovery, person-centered care, case management, primary and behavioral healthcare integration, and mental health policy                         Biography     Dr. Victoria Stanhope is an assistant professor at the NYU Silver School of Social Work. She received her PhD in social welfare from the University of Pennsylvania and her Master\u2019s in Social Work from the University of Pittsburgh. Her professional interests are in mental health services research and policy. Her areas of specialization are recovery, person-centered care, case management, and primary and behavioral healthcare integration. Her research has been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.   Dr. Stanhope\u2019s teaching area is in social welfare policy and research methods. She has taught courses as an adjunct faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania and LaSalle University. She practiced as a social worker in community-based mental health providing case management services to people with severe mental illnesses. Her clinical focus was on social skills training and implementing dialectical behavioral therapy in case management settings.   Prior to her social work career, Dr. Stanhope has eight years policy experience working in Washington, DC. She received an MA in public policy from The George Washington University and worked as an advocate for school psychologists in the areas of mental health, heath care, and diversity issues. She participated in national coalitions of public interest organizations lobbying Congress and the administration on issues related to health care reform, welfare reform, and mental health parity.     Her primary research focus has been provider-consumer relationships and how they impact the implementation of evidence-based practices, service engagement, and client outcomes. The context for this research has been the mental health recovery movement, which has made service choice, person-centered care, and shared decision making a cornerstone of mental health reform. The aim of her research is to understand how providers can enter into meaningful partnerships with their clients to improve outcomes and to use this knowledge to develop interventions that give providers the knowledge, skills, tools, and organizational support to pursue these partnerships in diverse and complex service settings.

There's also a lively SHERP-only e-mail listserv; if you're a graduate or a current student, you can join the discussion . Many of our alumni, students and faculty are on Twitter, so follow us !   More than 170 alumni, students and friends of SHERP gathered in the fall of 2012 to celebrate our 30th anniversary , which included a panel discussion ( watch the video !) with best-selling authors Rebecca Skloot and Mary Roach and Radiolab creator Jad Abumrad. In 2007, we celebrated our 25th anniversary with a full day of events , including a symposium on artificial life featuring famed geneticist J. Craig Venter and the debut of a ten-minute video about the history of SHERP.\u00a0     A Message to SHERP/SERP Alumnae, Alumni and Friends :   You already know about the sacrifices required to finance a top-flight graduate education. Now you can assist current and future students by contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund . All proceeds are used for tuition-remission scholarships for deserving SHERP students, based on need and achievement. You can make a tax-deductible contribution online via this secure site or can send a check made out to New York University, with 'Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund' written in the lower left corner. The address is: Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund c/o Carter Journalism Institute, 20 Cooper Square, NY, NY 10003.   And to all our donors , thank you!     SHERP and SERP, Year by Year, Counting Backwards...   The list below reflects the last known professional position held by each SHERP and SERP graduate all the way back to the first classes in the 1980s.\u00a0(We added the 'H' in 2005 to reflect the program's longtime emphasis on health and medical journalism.)

Vitae                              Areas of Expertise       Mental health services, recovery, person-centered care, case management, primary and behavioral healthcare integration, and mental health policy                         Biography     Dr. Victoria Stanhope is an assistant professor at the NYU Silver School of Social Work. She received her PhD in social welfare from the University of Pennsylvania and her Master\u2019s in Social Work from the University of Pittsburgh. Her professional interests are in mental health services research and policy. Her areas of specialization are recovery, person-centered care, case management, and primary and behavioral healthcare integration. Her research has been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.   Dr. Stanhope\u2019s teaching area is in social welfare policy and research methods. She has taught courses as an adjunct faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania and LaSalle University. She practiced as a social worker in community-based mental health providing case management services to people with severe mental illnesses. Her clinical focus was on social skills training and implementing dialectical behavioral therapy in case management settings.   Prior to her social work career, Dr. Stanhope has eight years policy experience working in Washington, DC. She received an MA in public policy from The George Washington University and worked as an advocate for school psychologists in the areas of mental health, heath care, and diversity issues. She participated in national coalitions of public interest organizations lobbying Congress and the administration on issues related to health care reform, welfare reform, and mental health parity.     Her primary research focus has been provider-consumer relationships and how they impact the implementation of evidence-based practices, service engagement, and client outcomes. The context for this research has been the mental health recovery movement, which has made service choice, person-centered care, and shared decision making a cornerstone of mental health reform. The aim of her research is to understand how providers can enter into meaningful partnerships with their clients to improve outcomes and to use this knowledge to develop interventions that give providers the knowledge, skills, tools, and organizational support to pursue these partnerships in diverse and complex service settings.

Craig Venter and the debut of a ten-minute video about the history of SHERP.\u00a0     A Message to SHERP/SERP Alumnae, Alumni and Friends :   You already know about the sacrifices required to finance a top-flight graduate education. Now you can assist current and future students by contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund . All proceeds are used for tuition-remission scholarships for deserving SHERP students, based on need and achievement. You can make a tax-deductible contribution online via this secure site or can send a check made out to New York University, with 'Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund' written in the lower left corner. The address is: Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund c/o Carter Journalism Institute, 20 Cooper Square, NY, NY 10003.   And to all our donors , thank you!     SHERP and SERP, Year by Year, Counting Backwards...   The list below reflects the last known professional position held by each SHERP and SERP graduate all the way back to the first classes in the 1980s.\u00a0(We added the 'H' in 2005 to reflect the program's longtime emphasis on health and medical journalism.)
