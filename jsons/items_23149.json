Now entering its 37th year, the program combines workshops, strategy sessions, and presentations by some of the leading figures in publishing. Our faculty members and speakers introduce students to the editorial, marketing, creative, business, sales, and digital aspects of the industry. The program also places a large emphasis on using editorial and media skills in a wider range of media brands such as pure digital and e-commerce companies.     Students create actual launch plans for new magazine brands and imprints for book publishing houses, and learn from having their projects judged by a panel of senior publishing executives. At the conclusion of the program, students attend a Career Fair where they interview with some of the nation's leading publishing companies.   The Summer Publishing Institute is designed for recent college graduates and for young professionals who are interested in careers in book and magazine publishing.
