The  myths and realities of the \"Golden Age of Piracy.\" The emergence of Spain as a  political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of  French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne  raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony  and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and  cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that  flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its  suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century.

We investigate Mao\u2019s thought and  theories, as well as his revolutionary practice, not as biographical  artifacts but as products of and contributors to the revolutionary  situation in China and the world in the 20th century. We end with  Mao\u2019s afterlives. The majority of the readings are drawn from Mao\u2019s  own writings. Students will learn to read Mao\u2019s texts intensively  and extensively.

By bridging the conventional divide  between \u201ccolonial\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d Africa, the course opens  up questions about the changes in African economies, religious  beliefs, family relations, and conceptions of the world around them  during the last half century.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour.

Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history.

The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema.

Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.

Cuba: History and  Revolution   HIST-UA 755 Ferrer. 4  points.   Cuba was one of the  first territories colonized by Spain and among the last to secure its  independence. It was among the last territories in the hemisphere to  abolish slavery, yet home to the first black political party in the  Americas. Its struggle for independence from Spain helped usher in an  age of U.S. imperialism. It is the hemisphere\u2019s first and last  socialist state.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union. This course traces the evolution of European capitalism   during the twentieth century, from a laissez-faire to a social market   economy. Throughout the semester we will study key themes and turning   points that shaped Europe's economic development: the Great Depression;   the World Wars; alternative ways of organizing an economic life under   fascism and communism; the stagnation of the 1970s; and European   economic integration.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.

Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.

Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.

It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history.

The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.

The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis.

This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture. Readings will range from the seventeenth to the twentieth century and will focus primarily, but not exclusively on Europe and the United States. Topics will include the study of the production and consumption of particular commodities; middle-class and working-class consumer cultures in the nineteenth century; and mass production and mass consumption in the twentieth century. We will look at protests and popular movements organized around issues of consumption; examine how products from the non-European world transformed European and American consumption; and how European, and especially American patterns of consumption shaped consumption elsewhere.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law.

Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.   Explores the historical  issues of the Great Depression and the New Deal years, 1933\u20131941,  by discussing several relevant works on this period. Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.

Examines 20th-century  Taiwan and China in their interrelationship and their divergent  paths. It is not a diplomatic or international history course.  Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.    Colloquium : Gender and  Radicalism in Modern China   HIST-UA 536 Identical  to EAST-UA 536. Offered every year. Karl. 4 points.   Examines the  interrelated rise of political, ideological, and cultural radicalisms  and of gender issues as a major subject and object of transformative  social activity in 19th- and 20th-century China. Introduces  approaches to gender theory and historical analysis through the use  of primary and secondary sources on China, as well as through films  and other visuals. Emphasis is on synthesizing contradictory material  and on historical analytical issues. Includes a heavy writing and  class-discussion component.

The course explores  the key reasons for their emergence, dynamism, and demise. Considers  such factors as governance, commerce, the arts and architecture,  social organization, and religion. The period covered extends from  the New Kingdom in Egypt (1550 B.C.E.) to the forest kingdoms of West  Africa on the eve of the Atlantic slave trade in the mid-15th  century.      Seminar: Japan and  World War II in Asia   HIST-UA 710 Identical  to EAST-UA 710. Offered every other year. 4 points.   Takes up a watershed  event in Japanese history, the greatest single preoccupation of  Japanese historians. The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.      Seminar: Latin America  and the Caribbean   HIST-UA 799 Offered  every year. Ferrer, Grandin, Thomson, Weinstein. 4 points.

Global and Special  Topics Seminars    History of the Body HIST-UA 310 Offered every two years. 4 points. History of the Body from Birth to Death. Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture. Readings will range from the seventeenth to the twentieth century and will focus primarily, but not exclusively on Europe and the United States. Topics will include the study of the production and consumption of particular commodities; middle-class and working-class consumer cultures in the nineteenth century; and mass production and mass consumption in the twentieth century. We will look at protests and popular movements organized around issues of consumption; examine how products from the non-European world transformed European and American consumption; and how European, and especially American patterns of consumption shaped consumption elsewhere.
