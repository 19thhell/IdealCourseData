The Minor in Applied Theatre offers interested students, both theatre specialists and non-specialists, the opportunity to learn how performance has been and can be a vital adjunct to non-theatrical professions and cultural practices. The Minor consists of a minimum of sixteen credits, twelve of which must be from a list of designated Department of Drama courses. The remaining four credits may be either another course for the above list or a course on a related topic from another department (from Tisch or from another school of New York University). Some of these courses simultaneously fulfill liberal arts credits. Please present the course syllabus to the Director of Theatre Studies and Rosemary Quinn for assessment. Finally, students need to do an Internship in Applied Theatre in order to earn the Minor which is overseen by Rosemary Quinn, rq1@nyu.edu. (2-4 credits.) To Minor in Applied Theatre, the student should fill out the declaration form available from their academic advisor. Director of Student Services: Scott Loane, scott.loane@nyu.edu.
