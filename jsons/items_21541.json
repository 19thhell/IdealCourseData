Located in a school of public service rather than in a medical or public health school, our program crosses traditional boundaries, linking management, finance, policy, and providing students with the cutting-edge concepts and skills needed to shape the future of health policy and management.   Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.

Located in a school of public service rather than in a medical or public health school, our program crosses traditional boundaries, linking management, finance, policy, and providing students with the cutting-edge concepts and skills needed to shape the future of health policy and management.   Students receive a set of tools and experiences that allow them to understand both the delivery of health care services and the broader social, cultural, and economic factors that influence health outcomes. Our students experience firsthand the importance of health care delivery and health promotion in one of the most interesting, diverse, and complex cities in the world, and our graduates work in every sector of the health care system.

A liaison between administrative functions and Information Technology.   A strategic partner in developing the vision and roadmap for administrative systems and services across the Global Network University (GNU).                                                  PSO Projects &amp; Initiatives          The PSO is currently involved in a number of the University's administrative systems initiatives and projects.              UDW+   The University Data Warehouse Plus (UDW+) is a program aimed at establishing decision support services around reporting and analytics. Over time, the UDW+ will replace the current University Data Warehouse architecture.  ServiceLink  The ServiceLink initiative seeks to transform the user experience and administrative services for the NYU Community across the GNU. The multi-phased project also involves the implementation of ServiceNow, a new tool to create and manage requests.  Procure-to-Pay (Lighthouse)    The Procure to Pay Project (Lighthouse) will transform how NYU buys, pays and manages goods and services across the University Community. This transformation will be accomplished by improving the user experience through greater visibility to transactions, reductions in paper based processes and replacement of unsupported technical solutions and platforms.  Position Management  Leveraging capabilities in both UDW+ and PeopleSync, this initiative will provide members of the University with the ability to plan, manage and report on academic and non-academic positions in the Position Management staffing model with a much greater level of clarity and visibility.
