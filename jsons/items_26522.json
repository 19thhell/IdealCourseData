The focus is on understanding interrelations between music businesses and consumer technologies, audio for games and other interactive applications, sound design in the digital music space, and emerging platforms for the generation and exploitation of music. Applicants for this concentration submit details of their prior academic and/or professional music and business technology experience. In their final MA projects, students in the Concentration have developed mobile apps, started businesses, proposed business and technology policies and strategies to government agencies, used technology to promote emerging music trends abroad, and built new IP (intellectual property) assets for start-up firms using recorded music samples.    The Music Business Graduate Program is a specialized graduate degree that addresses the music industry as a unique business operating within corporate and entrepreneurial structures. The skills you develop will serve you well in a fast-paced industry that needs thoroughly trained personnel who can apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension. Business courses are offered through NYU's Leonard N. Stern School of Business.

The focus is on understanding interrelations between music businesses and consumer technologies, audio for games and other interactive applications, sound design in the digital music space, and emerging platforms for the generation and exploitation of music. Applicants for this concentration submit details of their prior academic and/or professional music and business technology experience. In their final MA projects, students in the Concentration have developed mobile apps, started businesses, proposed business and technology policies and strategies to government agencies, used technology to promote emerging music trends abroad, and built new IP (intellectual property) assets for start-up firms using recorded music samples.    The Music Business Graduate Program is a specialized graduate degree that addresses the music industry as a unique business operating within corporate and entrepreneurial structures. The skills you develop will serve you well in a fast-paced industry that needs thoroughly trained personnel who can apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension.

The focus is on understanding interrelations between music businesses and consumer technologies, audio for games and other interactive applications, sound design in the digital music space, and emerging platforms for the generation and exploitation of music. Applicants for this concentration submit details of their prior academic and/or professional music and business technology experience. In their final MA projects, students in the Concentration have developed mobile apps, started businesses, proposed business and technology policies and strategies to government agencies, used technology to promote emerging music trends abroad, and built new IP (intellectual property) assets for start-up firms using recorded music samples.    The Music Business Graduate Program is a specialized graduate degree that addresses the music industry as a unique business operating within corporate and entrepreneurial structures. The skills you develop will serve you well in a fast-paced industry that needs thoroughly trained personnel who can apply business and administration theory to problems that have a strong aesthetic and artistic dimension.

No, we have students in the Music Business graduate program with a very wide range of undergraduate degrees, from music to business, liberal arts to engineering.    Q: If I did not major in business, how can I demonstrate my quantitative skills? A. We recommend that you either take the GRE or coursework (for credit) in areas such as accounting, statistics, or economics. The coursework does not need to be part of your undergraduate degree, but you will need to provide an official transcript with your application.    Q: What is the minimum or average GPA? A. We don't provide a minimum or average GPA because successful applicants come from such a wide range of academic and professional backgrounds. We look for a very strong academic record.

We ask that you adequately describe your skills and experience in your Personal Data Outline to give us an idea of your familiarity with music and business technology.    Q: If I am denied admission into the music technology concentration or to the standard MUBG track, can I automatically be considered for the other option? A: These are two separate majors, so if you are denied admission you may not be considered for the other option. You would be eligible to re-apply for either option for the following year.    Q: Can I take a Statistics course at a local community college in order to satisfy the Statistics prerequisite? A: Yes. You must provide us with an official transcript with the grade you received for the course. The course must have been taken for credit, and should be the equivalent to one semester long.

Grades are reviewed before students get confirmation that the pre-requisite has been met.
