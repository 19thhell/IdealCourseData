You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above.

Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the NYU school or college after a student is admitted. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not evaluate courses for possible transfer credit before a student is admitted to NYU. Freshmen are generally awarded a maximum of 32 credits upon arrival at NYU and transfer students are generally awarded a maximum of 64 credits upon arrival at NYU. Transfer students must typically take a minimum of 64 credits at NYU to obtain a bachelor's degree from NYU.          AP Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the College Board to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (NYU's code is 2562).     IB Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the International Baccalaureate Organization to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.     College/University Course Credit   Credits Earned While In High School   Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better in the courses and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. Generally, these courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.     NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.   Credits Earned After High School   Students may be eligible for transfer credit in courses taken for credit at an accredited college within the last ten years, provided the student earned a minimum grade of &quot;C.&quot; Upon receiving an offer of admission, students will receive a detailed evaluation of transfer credit. All courses specific to a student\u2019s intended major will be reviewed by the appropriate academic department. We are not able to evaluate coursework for transfer credit until an admissions decision is made.   Credit is not awarded for Pass/Fail grades and some schools and colleges at NYU have rigorous standards for credit. For example, some schools and colleges at NYU will only grant credit for courses taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students and taught by a college/university faculty member. The Stern School of Business will not award credit to freshmen for any economics, statistics, or business course taken anywhere but at Stern. In general, Stern freshmen should also not expect to receive any credits for math courses; in some cases, a student may be eligible to receive credit for calculus-level courses \u2013 but only after first completing a calculus course here at NYU.   Academic course credit will typically not be awarded for life experiences (e.g. work, internships, military service, etc.). Credit for courses taken online will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each department/school/college after admission and upon arrival at NYU, provided that the course was completed at an accredited college or university.     For transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will provide a preliminary statement of transfer credit (accessible online) at the time of admission, to give admitted students a general sense of credit allocation a student can expect to receive upon enrollment at NYU. Preliminary transfer credit evaluations will not be provided prior to admission. Decisions on the awarding of actual credit will ultimately be made by each department/school/college at NYU.     NYU Abu Dhabi does not offer credit for any examinations or previous coursework. NYU Shanghai has yet to define its credit allocation policies.

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the NYU school or college after a student is admitted. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not evaluate courses for possible transfer credit before a student is admitted to NYU. Freshmen are generally awarded a maximum of 32 credits upon arrival at NYU and transfer students are generally awarded a maximum of 64 credits upon arrival at NYU. Transfer students must typically take a minimum of 64 credits at NYU to obtain a bachelor's degree from NYU.          AP Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the College Board to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (NYU's code is 2562).     IB Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the International Baccalaureate Organization to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.     College/University Course Credit   Credits Earned While In High School   Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better in the courses and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. Generally, these courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.     NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.   Credits Earned After High School   Students may be eligible for transfer credit in courses taken for credit at an accredited college within the last ten years, provided the student earned a minimum grade of &quot;C.&quot; Upon receiving an offer of admission, students will receive a detailed evaluation of transfer credit. All courses specific to a student\u2019s intended major will be reviewed by the appropriate academic department. We are not able to evaluate coursework for transfer credit until an admissions decision is made.   Credit is not awarded for Pass/Fail grades and some schools and colleges at NYU have rigorous standards for credit. For example, some schools and colleges at NYU will only grant credit for courses taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students and taught by a college/university faculty member. The Stern School of Business will not award credit to freshmen for any economics, statistics, or business course taken anywhere but at Stern. In general, Stern freshmen should also not expect to receive any credits for math courses; in some cases, a student may be eligible to receive credit for calculus-level courses \u2013 but only after first completing a calculus course here at NYU.   Academic course credit will typically not be awarded for life experiences (e.g. work, internships, military service, etc.). Credit for courses taken online will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each department/school/college after admission and upon arrival at NYU, provided that the course was completed at an accredited college or university.     For transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will provide a preliminary statement of transfer credit (accessible online) at the time of admission, to give admitted students a general sense of credit allocation a student can expect to receive upon enrollment at NYU. Preliminary transfer credit evaluations will not be provided prior to admission. Decisions on the awarding of actual credit will ultimately be made by each department/school/college at NYU.     NYU Abu Dhabi does not offer credit for any examinations or previous coursework. NYU Shanghai has yet to define its credit allocation policies.                                Country-Specific Examination Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing may be awarded for country-specific examinations according to the following standards:                                                          Commonwealth Caribbean Region                               Exam: CXC Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     Minimum Score: II     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      France                               Exam: Baccalaur\u00e9at   Minimum Score: 12     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Germany                               Exam: Abitur     Minimum Score: 10     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Italy                               Exam: Esame di Stato (Maturit\u00e1)     Minimum Score: 7     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 4 credits/points                                                                      United Kingdom                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points       Exam: Cambridge Pre-U     Minimum Score: M2     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Singapore                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Switzerland                               Exam: Matura     Minimum Score: 4.5     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
