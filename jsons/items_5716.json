Carrying out and analyzing art tasks is the means of treatment. Art therapists may act in the capacity of primary therapist or as part of a treatment team. REQUIREMENTS : Students with a liberal arts degree go into a master's program in Art Therapy. These programs take a minimum of two years to complete. Most programs also require a minimum of 600 hours of supervised practicum; a few require 1,000 hours. Art therapists can apply for registration by the American Art Therapy Association (AATA) and receive the status ATR (Art Therapist, Registered). NYU REQUIREMENTS : NYU's graduate Art Therapy program requires the following undergraduate pre-requisites: \u00b7 Twelve credits in Psychology \u00b7 Eighteen credits in Studio Art \u00b7 Thirty credits in behavioral or social sciences and/or liberal arts NYU CONTACT : NYU Steinhardt School of Education, Art Therapy Program 34 Stuyvesant Street, Room 306 New York, NY 10003 Tel: (212) 998-5700 http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/art/therapy/ FOR FURTHER INFORMATION : The American Art Therapy Association, Inc. 1202 Allanson Road Mundelein, IL 60060 Tel: (888) 290-0878 http://arttherapy.org/          Biomedical Scientist       The basic medical sciences encompass a variety of non-clinical areas of the medical school curriculum, including: biochemistry, cell biology, environmental oncology, microbiology, parasitology, pathology, pharmacology, and physiology. Most of these Ph.D. programs are located physically in a medical school, with each basic medical science represented by a specific department. Most students in such programs receive full-tuition scholarships, frequently with living allowances. Scientists in this field have many career opportunities. In the past they usually chose academic positions involving both research and teaching, including the training of future Ph.D.s in basic medical science. With the present development of biotechnology industries, however, more and more scientists are entering research positions in industry, since a good deal of the research performed in this new and developing sector is in essence \"basic research.\" In addition to research and/or teaching, some scientists leave \"hands on\" work for positions with government or private funding agencies, or agencies concerned with such issues as environmental protection, scientific ethics, education policy, and the like. Finally, some become popular periodical science writers or editors for scientific publishing companies. REQUIREMENTS : All applicants must have a B.S. or B.A. degree in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, or physics, and must also have some research experience beyond formal laboratory courses. All candidates must take the GRE.

We suggest as a starting point an excellent article, \"Careers in Biology,\" by Roy H. and Barbara W. Sago. This paper, in pamphlet form and augmented by a substantial list of professional societies from which students can request information, is available from the American Institute of Biological Sciences. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION : American Institute of Biological Sciences 730 11th Street, NW Washington, DC 20001-4584 Tel: (202) 628-1500 http://www.aibs.org/          Chiropractor       Chiropractors are concerned with the relationship between structure (the spine, extravertebral joints, muscles, etc.) and function (the nervous and vascular systems). Chiropractors evaluate posture and spinal structure, and treat patients whose health problems are associated with the muscular, nervous, and skeletal systems. Although employment of chiropractors is to a degree governed by the economy, there appears to be a general increase in the acceptance by the public for this type of treatment. This is particularly true in the western and southwestern states. There are seventeen chiropractic schools in the United States. Training programs can include up to five years of study depending on the program. Applications must be sent directly to the school(s) in which you are interested. REQUIREMENTS : All chiropractic colleges require applicants to have at least two years of undergraduate study. Most applicants have a bachelor's degree, and this is quickly becoming the minimum entry requirement. These schools also require a certain level of physical ability (i.e., strength and dexterity) and test for this before admission. Applicants must have a minimum GPA of 2.5. Undergraduate pre-chiropractic study requires the following courses: \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Psychology (1 course) \u00b7 English (2 courses) \u00b7 Humanities and Social Science Electives (varies by school) Some schools recommend the following courses: Anatomy, Biochemistry, Physiology, Genetics, Calculus, Microbiology, and Molecular and Cellular Biology.

The massive international effort to map all human genes has been virtually completed as of the year 2000 and tests for specific genes are widely available. Should individuals avail themselves of such tests? What do the results of these tests mean? What options are available to individuals who have such \"defective\" genes? The answers to these questions are not simple, and involve an understanding of genetics, statistics, psychology, ethics, law, and sociology. This is the province of the genetic counselor. Training is available at the M.S., M.D., Ph.D., M.D./Ph.D., and post-doctoral level. REQUIREMENTS : For someone with a bachelor's degree wishing to apply to an M.S. program, a knowledge of genetics, statistics, and psychology is essential. A biology or psychology major with some additional elective courses will provide an excellent starting point. Some programs require or recommend courses in Biology, Chemistry, Embryology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Statistics. Programs also may want to see shadowing/intern experience or counseling experience.

Individual health care administrators find themselves in a wide range of career positions from assistant administrators or directors of group practices to directors of HMOs or CEOs of major hospitals. Health care administrators can be classified into two groups: generalists and clinical specialists. Generalists oversee an entire hospital or HMO or serve as assistants to the chief administrator. Clinic administrators oversee the administration of specialized healthcare services\u2014physical therapy, long-term care, radiology, and the like. Students who wish to pursue a career in Health Care Administration can study in an accredited undergraduate program in Health Services Administration leading to a bachelor's degree. Some students opt to pursue a liberal arts degree at the undergraduate level and then pursue a master's degree in Health Services Administration. REQUIREMENTS : Undergraduate courses in Health Policy, Economics, and Business may be helpful. NYU REQUIREMENTS : GRE or GMAT scores are recommended for the M.P.A. program in Wagner.

The object is ostensibly to prepare the candidate for research and similar work in the health sciences. It is no secret, however, that many students use these programs fruitfully to improve their chances of admission to medical school (sometimes also to veterinary medical or dental school). There are a number of programs which give students the opportunity to demonstrate that they can handle the course work and then reapply to medical school. Obviously, good grades in the classes show that the student can succeed in professional school. Students are permitted\u2014even encouraged\u2014to apply to medical school and are by no means required to complete the master's programs (some of the programs are for only one year). You would not be exempted from the first year of medical school because you will not have completed the entire first year. Exemption from the particular courses already completed is entirely at the discretion of the medical school of matriculation. Two words of warning: A student considering this approach should bear in mind that the probable reason for his or her original nonacceptance to medical school was grades. Is it realistic to expect a significant improvement in the upcoming year to cause a medical school to change its opinion? Every other student in the program is going to be in a similar situation, trying equally hard. Only a small percentage will actually gain admission. For this reason it would be wise to enroll only in those programs which, should you still not be admitted to medical school, provide you with some extra qualification which you can use in an alternative career, should that be necessary.

The American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA) is the professional membership organization that represents the mental health counseling profession. Clinical membership in AMHCA requires a master's degree in counseling or a closely related mental health field and adherence to AMHCA's National Standards for Clinical Practice. Graduate education and clinical training prepare mental health counselors to provide a full range of services for individuals, couples, families, adolescents and children. Mental health counselors practice in a variety of settings, including independent practice, community agencies, managed behavioral health care organizations, integrated delivery systems, hospitals, employee assistance programs and substance abuse treatment centers. REQUIREMENTS : Licensure requirements for mental health counselors are equivalent to those for clinical social workers and marriage and family therapists - two other disciplines that require a master's degree for independent status.

They help prevent and treat conditions such as hypertension and obesity by promoting healthy eating habits. To become a registered dietician, you must complete an academic program and a clinical training component of roughly six months in duration before sitting for the registration exam. There are several different ways in which you can complete the requirements to become a Registered Dietician (R.D.); for a student with a B.A. degree, however, earning a master's degree in nutrition appears to be the most sensible approach. Students who do not major in Nutrition can apply for an M.A. program, which will ask them to complete a 15-course Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) before they can start their M.A. work. CAS students may wish to consider completing the Nutrition minor, which will fulfill several DPD requirements. REQUIREMENTS : Students must be well grounded in biology, chemistry, physiology, and computer applications, as well as social sciences.

They help people improve or regain their basic motor functions, reasoning, and ability to perform activities of daily living (such as dressing, bathing, cooking, or driving) to help them achieve as much independence as possible. A bachelor's degree in occupational therapy is the minimum requirement for this field, though students already holding a liberal arts B.A. would generally be best served by earning a master's degree in Occupational Therapy. REQUIREMENTS : Students applying to the master's program in Occupational Therapy should usually have taken the GRE and the following courses at the undergraduate level: \u00b7 Basic Statistics (1 semester) \u00b7 Introduction to Sociology (1 semester) \u00b7 Psychology (3 semesters, including Introductory, Developmental, and Abnormal Psychology) \u00b7 Anatomy and Physiology (1-2 semesters) Some schools may require Biology with Lab; others may recommend General Chemistry or Physics with Lab. NYU REQUIREMENTS : The OT program at NYU requires Developmental Psychology, Abnormal Psychology, 1 semester of behavioral sciences (Anthropology, Psychology, or Sociology), Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology (2 semesters), and Statistics.

Doctors of optometry may work in private practice, hospitals, industry, research, the military, and community centers. There are eighteen schools of optometry in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Canada. Application deadlines vary widely from school to school. You certainly should gain experience and exposure to this health profession by working in a vision center or optometrist's office. REQUIREMENTS : At least three years of undergraduate education; schools show a strong preference for applicants with a bachelor's degree. You are very strongly advised to complete your baccalaureate degree before proceeding to Optometry School. Applicants must take the Optometry Admissions Test (OAT), which has sections on Natural Sciences (Biology, General Chemistry, and Organic Chemistry), Reading Comprehension, Physics, and Quantitative Reasoning. Undergraduate pre-optometry study requires the following courses: \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (1-2 semesters; we urge taking the full sequence) \u00b7 Calculus (1 semester) \u00b7 Statistics (1 semester) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Writing and English (2 semesters) Some schools also require courses in Microbiology, Psychology, Social Sciences, Biochemistry, and Physiology. Other schools recommend courses in Anatomy and advanced Biology. You should consult school websites, as well as the reference booklet Schools and Colleges of Optometry: Admissions Requirements . A copy of this book is kept in Silver 901 for students to consult.

They advise patients and doctors about the effects and strengths of both prescription and over-the-counter medications, including selection and dosage. You do not necessarily have to have an undergraduate pharmacy degree to be eligible for a graduate degree in pharmacy. Most pharmacy schools break their education into two parts: two years of \"preprofessional education,\" and a subsequent period of \"professional studies.\" A student with an undergraduate degree including the regular prehealth curriculum generally would be accepted as a transfer student directly into the professional part of the program. (The Pharm.D. requires 2 years of undergraduate preprofessional coursework followed by 4 academic years (3 calendar years) of professional study.) However, students should carefully research the admissions policies of pharmacy schools that interest them. Some of these schools prefer to admit most of their students as freshmen right out of high school, and therefore have only limited seats available for transfer students who have completed a liberal arts degree and wish to enter the professional phase of a Pharm.D. program. REQUIREMENTS : Most schools require the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT). The preprofessional requirements vary from school to school, but the following are essential: \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Calculus (1-2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Writing and English (2 semesters) \u00b7 Humanities and Social Science electives Some schools may also require courses in Physical Education, Statistics, Anatomy, Physiology, Microbiology, and/or Public Speaking.

They provide help with daily functioning to accident victims, amputees, and individuals with conditions such as cerebral palsy or arthritis. They use exercise, ultrasound, and other methods to relieve pain and increase the range of mobility, and to help patients adjust to the use of crutches, wheelchairs, and prosthetics. Physical therapy can be studied at either the undergraduate level or the graduate level. Those students who already have a liberal arts degree have two options: earn a second bachelor's degree in Physical Therapy, or apply to an entry-level graduate program. NYU offers a three-year entry-level clinical Doctor of Physical Therapy (D.P.T.) program. Acceptance into PT programs is very competitive. Irrespective of which of these two pathways you choose, the requirements are basically the same and include observation of a PT practice and a letter of recommendation from a physical therapist. Applicants should generally plan on taking the GRE and the following courses: REQUIREMENTS : \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General/Inorganic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Anatomy &amp; Physiology (1-2 semesters) \u00b7 English and Writing (2 semesters) Some schools may also require or recommend courses in Psychology, Organic Chemistry, and/or Biochemistry. NYU REQUIREMENTS : NYU's D.P.T. program requires applicants to have taken all of the above, plus Speech Communication (1 semester), Statistics (1 semester), and 3 Social Science courses, including Psychology (1 semester). Organic Chemistry or Biochemistry is recommended (1-2 semesters).

Select activity modalities are utilized to treat or maintain the physical, mental and emotional well-being of their patients. These interventions help individuals remediate the effects of illness or disability and achieve an optimal level of independence. The goals of interventions include improving physical, cognitive and social functioning. A degree in Therapeutic Recreation (or in Recreation with an emphasis in Therapeutic Recreation) is required to be considered for jobs in clinical settings such as hospitals or community mental health facilities. REQUIREMENTS : Academic programs in therapeutic recreation emphasize course work in the Physical, Biological, and Behavioral Sciences and Recreation and Leisure Theory. Relevant courses include: Anatomy, Psychology, and Art. Some states require a certification examination.

For those uncertain of their commitment to the health professions, science teaching provides an opportunity to hone further the appropriate skills and develop a solid track record in the \"helping professions.\" Science educators usually major in a science at the undergraduate level, and some may go on to graduate work in their field. A core of education courses, student teaching, and a certification test set the science educator apart from science students who are not prepared for teaching. Usually science educators seek to become certified by the state in which they live, as this leads to a broader range of teaching opportunities and to higher salaries.

Most students in such programs receive full-tuition scholarships, frequently with living allowances. Scientists in this field have many career opportunities. In the past they usually chose academic positions involving both research and teaching, including the training of future Ph.D.s in basic medical science. With the present development of biotechnology industries, however, more and more scientists are entering research positions in industry, since a good deal of the research performed in this new and developing sector is in essence \"basic research.\" In addition to research and/or teaching, some scientists leave \"hands on\" work for positions with government or private funding agencies, or agencies concerned with such issues as environmental protection, scientific ethics, education policy, and the like. Finally, some become popular periodical science writers or editors for scientific publishing companies. REQUIREMENTS : All applicants must have a B.S. or B.A. degree in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, or physics, and must also have some research experience beyond formal laboratory courses. All candidates must take the GRE.

Chiropractors evaluate posture and spinal structure, and treat patients whose health problems are associated with the muscular, nervous, and skeletal systems. Although employment of chiropractors is to a degree governed by the economy, there appears to be a general increase in the acceptance by the public for this type of treatment. This is particularly true in the western and southwestern states. There are seventeen chiropractic schools in the United States. Training programs can include up to five years of study depending on the program. Applications must be sent directly to the school(s) in which you are interested. REQUIREMENTS : All chiropractic colleges require applicants to have at least two years of undergraduate study. Most applicants have a bachelor's degree, and this is quickly becoming the minimum entry requirement. These schools also require a certain level of physical ability (i.e., strength and dexterity) and test for this before admission. Applicants must have a minimum GPA of 2.5. Undergraduate pre-chiropractic study requires the following courses: \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Psychology (1 course) \u00b7 English (2 courses) \u00b7 Humanities and Social Science Electives (varies by school) Some schools recommend the following courses: Anatomy, Biochemistry, Physiology, Genetics, Calculus, Microbiology, and Molecular and Cellular Biology.

The massive international effort to map all human genes has been virtually completed as of the year 2000 and tests for specific genes are widely available. Should individuals avail themselves of such tests? What do the results of these tests mean? What options are available to individuals who have such \"defective\" genes? The answers to these questions are not simple, and involve an understanding of genetics, statistics, psychology, ethics, law, and sociology. This is the province of the genetic counselor. Training is available at the M.S., M.D., Ph.D., M.D./Ph.D., and post-doctoral level. REQUIREMENTS : For someone with a bachelor's degree wishing to apply to an M.S. program, a knowledge of genetics, statistics, and psychology is essential. A biology or psychology major with some additional elective courses will provide an excellent starting point. Some programs require or recommend courses in Biology, Chemistry, Embryology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Statistics. Programs also may want to see shadowing/intern experience or counseling experience.

Individual health care administrators find themselves in a wide range of career positions from assistant administrators or directors of group practices to directors of HMOs or CEOs of major hospitals. Health care administrators can be classified into two groups: generalists and clinical specialists. Generalists oversee an entire hospital or HMO or serve as assistants to the chief administrator. Clinic administrators oversee the administration of specialized healthcare services\u2014physical therapy, long-term care, radiology, and the like. Students who wish to pursue a career in Health Care Administration can study in an accredited undergraduate program in Health Services Administration leading to a bachelor's degree. Some students opt to pursue a liberal arts degree at the undergraduate level and then pursue a master's degree in Health Services Administration. REQUIREMENTS : Undergraduate courses in Health Policy, Economics, and Business may be helpful. NYU REQUIREMENTS : GRE or GMAT scores are recommended for the M.P.A. program in Wagner.

The object is ostensibly to prepare the candidate for research and similar work in the health sciences. It is no secret, however, that many students use these programs fruitfully to improve their chances of admission to medical school (sometimes also to veterinary medical or dental school). There are a number of programs which give students the opportunity to demonstrate that they can handle the course work and then reapply to medical school. Obviously, good grades in the classes show that the student can succeed in professional school. Students are permitted\u2014even encouraged\u2014to apply to medical school and are by no means required to complete the master's programs (some of the programs are for only one year). You would not be exempted from the first year of medical school because you will not have completed the entire first year. Exemption from the particular courses already completed is entirely at the discretion of the medical school of matriculation. Two words of warning: A student considering this approach should bear in mind that the probable reason for his or her original nonacceptance to medical school was grades. Is it realistic to expect a significant improvement in the upcoming year to cause a medical school to change its opinion? Every other student in the program is going to be in a similar situation, trying equally hard. Only a small percentage will actually gain admission. For this reason it would be wise to enroll only in those programs which, should you still not be admitted to medical school, provide you with some extra qualification which you can use in an alternative career, should that be necessary.

The American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA) is the professional membership organization that represents the mental health counseling profession. Clinical membership in AMHCA requires a master's degree in counseling or a closely related mental health field and adherence to AMHCA's National Standards for Clinical Practice. Graduate education and clinical training prepare mental health counselors to provide a full range of services for individuals, couples, families, adolescents and children. Mental health counselors practice in a variety of settings, including independent practice, community agencies, managed behavioral health care organizations, integrated delivery systems, hospitals, employee assistance programs and substance abuse treatment centers. REQUIREMENTS : Licensure requirements for mental health counselors are equivalent to those for clinical social workers and marriage and family therapists - two other disciplines that require a master's degree for independent status. A licensed mental health counselor has met or exceeded the following professional qualifications: (1) Earned a master's degree in counseling or a closely related mental health discipline (2) Completed a minimum of two years post master's clinical work under the supervision of a licensed or certified mental health professional (3) Passed a state-developed or national licensure or certification examination.

They help prevent and treat conditions such as hypertension and obesity by promoting healthy eating habits. To become a registered dietician, you must complete an academic program and a clinical training component of roughly six months in duration before sitting for the registration exam. There are several different ways in which you can complete the requirements to become a Registered Dietician (R.D.); for a student with a B.A. degree, however, earning a master's degree in nutrition appears to be the most sensible approach. Students who do not major in Nutrition can apply for an M.A. program, which will ask them to complete a 15-course Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) before they can start their M.A. work. CAS students may wish to consider completing the Nutrition minor, which will fulfill several DPD requirements. REQUIREMENTS : Students must be well grounded in biology, chemistry, physiology, and computer applications, as well as social sciences.

They help people improve or regain their basic motor functions, reasoning, and ability to perform activities of daily living (such as dressing, bathing, cooking, or driving) to help them achieve as much independence as possible. A bachelor's degree in occupational therapy is the minimum requirement for this field, though students already holding a liberal arts B.A. would generally be best served by earning a master's degree in Occupational Therapy. REQUIREMENTS : Students applying to the master's program in Occupational Therapy should usually have taken the GRE and the following courses at the undergraduate level: \u00b7 Basic Statistics (1 semester) \u00b7 Introduction to Sociology (1 semester) \u00b7 Psychology (3 semesters, including Introductory, Developmental, and Abnormal Psychology) \u00b7 Anatomy and Physiology (1-2 semesters) Some schools may require Biology with Lab; others may recommend General Chemistry or Physics with Lab.

Doctors of optometry may work in private practice, hospitals, industry, research, the military, and community centers. There are eighteen schools of optometry in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and Canada. Application deadlines vary widely from school to school. You certainly should gain experience and exposure to this health profession by working in a vision center or optometrist's office. REQUIREMENTS : At least three years of undergraduate education; schools show a strong preference for applicants with a bachelor's degree. You are very strongly advised to complete your baccalaureate degree before proceeding to Optometry School. Applicants must take the Optometry Admissions Test (OAT), which has sections on Natural Sciences (Biology, General Chemistry, and Organic Chemistry), Reading Comprehension, Physics, and Quantitative Reasoning. Undergraduate pre-optometry study requires the following courses: \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (1-2 semesters; we urge taking the full sequence) \u00b7 Calculus (1 semester) \u00b7 Statistics (1 semester) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Writing and English (2 semesters) Some schools also require courses in Microbiology, Psychology, Social Sciences, Biochemistry, and Physiology.

You do not necessarily have to have an undergraduate pharmacy degree to be eligible for a graduate degree in pharmacy. Most pharmacy schools break their education into two parts: two years of \"preprofessional education,\" and a subsequent period of \"professional studies.\" A student with an undergraduate degree including the regular prehealth curriculum generally would be accepted as a transfer student directly into the professional part of the program. (The Pharm.D. requires 2 years of undergraduate preprofessional coursework followed by 4 academic years (3 calendar years) of professional study.) However, students should carefully research the admissions policies of pharmacy schools that interest them. Some of these schools prefer to admit most of their students as freshmen right out of high school, and therefore have only limited seats available for transfer students who have completed a liberal arts degree and wish to enter the professional phase of a Pharm.D. program. REQUIREMENTS : Most schools require the Pharmacy College Admissions Test (PCAT). The preprofessional requirements vary from school to school, but the following are essential: \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Organic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Calculus (1-2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Writing and English (2 semesters) \u00b7 Humanities and Social Science electives Some schools may also require courses in Physical Education, Statistics, Anatomy, Physiology, Microbiology, and/or Public Speaking.

They provide help with daily functioning to accident victims, amputees, and individuals with conditions such as cerebral palsy or arthritis. They use exercise, ultrasound, and other methods to relieve pain and increase the range of mobility, and to help patients adjust to the use of crutches, wheelchairs, and prosthetics. Physical therapy can be studied at either the undergraduate level or the graduate level. Those students who already have a liberal arts degree have two options: earn a second bachelor's degree in Physical Therapy, or apply to an entry-level graduate program. NYU offers a three-year entry-level clinical Doctor of Physical Therapy (D.P.T.) program. Acceptance into PT programs is very competitive. Irrespective of which of these two pathways you choose, the requirements are basically the same and include observation of a PT practice and a letter of recommendation from a physical therapist. Applicants should generally plan on taking the GRE and the following courses: REQUIREMENTS : \u00b7 Biology with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 General/Inorganic Chemistry with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Physics with Labs (2 semesters) \u00b7 Anatomy &amp; Physiology (1-2 semesters) \u00b7 English and Writing (2 semesters) Some schools may also require or recommend courses in Psychology, Organic Chemistry, and/or Biochemistry. NYU REQUIREMENTS : NYU's D.P.T. program requires applicants to have taken all of the above, plus Speech Communication (1 semester), Statistics (1 semester), and 3 Social Science courses, including Psychology (1 semester).

For those uncertain of their commitment to the health professions, science teaching provides an opportunity to hone further the appropriate skills and develop a solid track record in the \"helping professions.\" Science educators usually major in a science at the undergraduate level, and some may go on to graduate work in their field. A core of education courses, student teaching, and a certification test set the science educator apart from science students who are not prepared for teaching. Usually science educators seek to become certified by the state in which they live, as this leads to a broader range of teaching opportunities and to higher salaries.
