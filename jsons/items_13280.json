It was approved by New York State as a student training program in the spring of 1997. It is not an APA accredited program; because we do not train for licensing as a practitioner.    The program focuses on training students to understand, study, and change the various contexts and social systems in which individuals develop and spend time. Contexts could include families, peer groups, schools, neighborhoods, cultural groups, or public policies. The program also trains students in empirical methods for designing and assessing intervention/prevention and health promotion efforts. Thus, the program maintains a heavy focus on conducting research in applied settings for the purposes of understanding and changing them. Program faculty study a broad range of issues including early childhood programs, school transitions, ethnic-racial identity development, homelessness, HIV-AIDs, welfare and work policy, and the like. Students complete a rigourous core curriculum, and are heavily engaged in research throughout the course of their training.    Core Ideas       The program focuses on studying people in context    The program focuses on changing settings and systems, and therefore on prevention, intervention, and health promotion    The intent of the program is to produce psychologists who can carry out socially relevant research aimed at understanding and solving social problems in natural settings.    Faculty study schools, neighborhoods, social service systems, local and state policy    The program has a heavy emphasis on theory, research, and social action       What is the Psychology and Social Intervention program?    &bull; A Ph.D. training program &bull; Core aim is to produce psychologists who can carry out socially relevant research aimed at understanding and solving social problems in natural settings. &bull; We study how features of schools, childcare programs, neighborhoods, policies, workplace, social service agencies, and the like influence individual well-being and behavior.    What similar program are there in the U.S.?    There are a number of related programs in disciplines such as Ecological Psychology, Human Development, Community Psychology, and other disciplines    Examples include:          Ecological Psychology | Michigan State University    Community and Prevention Research | University of Illinois, Chicago Circle    Human Deveopment and Social Policy | Northwestern University    Community-Clinical Psychology | University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign    Community Psychology | Georgia State University    Prevention Research Training Program | Arizona State University          Is there funding available for students who are admitted to the program?    Students will receive funding for four years of their training. Funding provides a stipend and covers tuition and benefits. Funding comes through student employment and Steinhardt fellowships.    How long does it take to complete the program?    Our program is designed so that students can complete core requirements within a 5-6 year period.    How many and which courses are required?

The program is not accredited by the APA which means that students are not eligible for professional licensure as practicioners.    Can I be a part-time student?

Lawrence Aber, LaRue Allen, Diane Hughes, Edward Seidman, Pamela Morris, Elise Cappella and Erin Godfrey. Core and affiliate faculty, and their research interests, are listed on the program website .    Are students admitted to work with a specific faculty member or do they choose a mentor after being accepted to the program?    Students are accepted to the PSI program as a whole, not to apprentice solely with one individual faculty member. Decisions about which faculty members incoming students will work with in their first year are made at the time of matriculation. we encourage students to work across at least two research labs over the course of their training.    Where can I find information on each professor's specific research interests?

A hallmark of our program is the fieldwork sequence which offers students the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained in lectures and readings to research and other real-world experiences. Additionally, our department offers students various opportunities to collaborate with faculty members; students may choose to participate in the Honors Program and conduct an independent research project under the guidance of the faculty mentor or volunteer as research assistants in faculty research teams. We also welcome students to participate in various study abroad programs offered at NYU.    NYU's Applied Psychology major provides excellent preparation for graduate programs in applied psychology, psychology, and psychology-related areas, as well as graduate programs in business and law. Students interested in counseling and guidance, school psychology, ecological and community psychology, human development, social work, and applications of psychology in community-based settings are best served by the Applied Psychology major in Steinhardt.
