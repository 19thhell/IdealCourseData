Therefore, students are eligible to apply for Kindergarten during the year of they turn 5 years old and Pre-K the year they turn 4 years old.   Public Kindergarten in NYC is offered for a full school day (typically 8:40 a.m.-2:50 p.m.). Kindergarten attendance is optional in NYC, however, if desired, children of NYC residents are guaranteed enrollment in a local public school beginning in Kindergarten. Children must enroll in school by the First Grade.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as \u201czoned schools,\u201d serve all children in a designated geographical catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website or by contacting NYC's Information Line, 311.   There are more than 700 public elementary schools, including 140 K-8 programs in NYC. During the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs , identify bi-lingual or dual language programs , or consider charter schools in their home neighborhood or elsewhere.   Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?

HCES is a publicly funded (tuition free) school that serves a diverse population of children who have been identified as \u201cintellectually talented.\u201d   Only Manhattan residents may apply to HCES. Parents must be able to document their home address as of the date of application and must remain residents of Manhattan as long as their children attend HCES.   No priority given to siblings enrolled at HCES.   The administered test to achieve acceptance to Hunter is available only in English. Therefore, children must have adequate fundamental skills in English to benefit from Hunter\u2019s program.     Application Process   The application process begins when a family requests or downloads an application from the HCES Admissions Office. Within two weeks of receipt of a completed application, families will be mailed their child's official HCES application identification number and a testing packet with all the materials necessary for scheduling an appointment for the Stanford-Binet 5 test with one of Hunter\u2019s approved psychologists.   There are two rounds of testing. In the First Round, the parent takes the child to an approved psychologist, who is trained to give the Stanford-Binet.   The only scores eligible for consideration are those from the first administration of the Stanford-Binet, given during the periods of September to December the year before the child\u2019s desired enrollment school year.   Parents are required to pay a $325 fee to the psychologist who administers the test. Information about fee waivers is available from the HCES Admissions Office.    If you child makes it to the Second Round of Hunter\u2019s application process, a play group and interview is scheduled. In addition, families will receive two forms - the \u201cParents' Observation Form\u201d and the \u201cPreschool Teacher's Observation Form\u201d - to be completed and returned to the school. Both forms request short written responses to specific questions about the child's observed behaviors from both parents and teachers.   Each year placement is offered to 25 boys and 25 girls based upon the recommendations of the HCES Admissions Committee. A waiting list of 12 boys and 12 girls is also generated from the Round 2 finalists.   Timeline for Applying to Hunter Elementary School   Remember: You are only guaranteed a seat in your zoned public school so it is important to visit the school to understand its strengths and challenges, learn how parents are engaged in the school, *and* apply during the stated time period.   September-October     Download application packet from Hunter College Elementary School.   Attend an open house evening as available.   Schedule assessment test according to the specified guidelines.     November     Hunter applications are due mid-November.   Schedule assessment test no later than early December according to specified guidelines.     December     Families are notified whether or not their child has made it to Round 2.

The birthday cutoff for school registration is December 31. Therefore, students are eligible to apply for Kindergarten during the year of they turn 5 years old and Pre-K the year they turn 4 years old.   Public Kindergarten in NYC is offered for a full school day (typically 8:40 a.m.-2:50 p.m.). Kindergarten attendance is optional in NYC, however, if desired, children of NYC residents are guaranteed enrollment in a local public school beginning in Kindergarten. Children must enroll in school by the First Grade.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as \u201czoned schools,\u201d serve all children in a designated geographical catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website or by contacting NYC's Information Line, 311.   There are more than 700 public elementary schools, including 140 K-8 programs in NYC. During the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs , identify bi-lingual or dual language programs , or consider charter schools in their home neighborhood or elsewhere.   Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?

HCES is a publicly funded (tuition free) school that serves a diverse population of children who have been identified as \u201cintellectually talented.\u201d   Only Manhattan residents may apply to HCES. Parents must be able to document their home address as of the date of application and must remain residents of Manhattan as long as their children attend HCES.   No priority given to siblings enrolled at HCES.   The administered test to achieve acceptance to Hunter is available only in English. Therefore, children must have adequate fundamental skills in English to benefit from Hunter\u2019s program.     Application Process   The application process begins when a family requests or downloads an application from the HCES Admissions Office. Within two weeks of receipt of a completed application, families will be mailed their child's official HCES application identification number and a testing packet with all the materials necessary for scheduling an appointment for the Stanford-Binet 5 test with one of Hunter\u2019s approved psychologists.   There are two rounds of testing. In the First Round, the parent takes the child to an approved psychologist, who is trained to give the Stanford-Binet.   The only scores eligible for consideration are those from the first administration of the Stanford-Binet, given during the periods of September to December the year before the child\u2019s desired enrollment school year.   Parents are required to pay a $325 fee to the psychologist who administers the test. Information about fee waivers is available from the HCES Admissions Office.    If you child makes it to the Second Round of Hunter\u2019s application process, a play group and interview is scheduled. In addition, families will receive two forms - the \u201cParents' Observation Form\u201d and the \u201cPreschool Teacher's Observation Form\u201d - to be completed and returned to the school. Both forms request short written responses to specific questions about the child's observed behaviors from both parents and teachers.   Each year placement is offered to 25 boys and 25 girls based upon the recommendations of the HCES Admissions Committee. A waiting list of 12 boys and 12 girls is also generated from the Round 2 finalists.
