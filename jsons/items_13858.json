We are collaborating with multiple organizations, including The GovLab@NYU, to bring together the NYU community to tackle this issue and raise awareness about the seriousness of this infectious disease.   Faced with the escalating Ebola epidemic and the need for a coordinated global response, USAID and partners have seen a clear urgency for innovative ideas to improve healthcare delivery and restrict the spread of the disease. This has led USAID to create a challenge How might we rapidly equip and empower the care community to fight ebola? on openIDEO, an open innovation platform, inviting the public to come together to brainstorm and develop innovative solutions for this endemic problem.   All the ideas we come up with can be posted on OpenIdeo (working directly with USAID). In addition we are partnering with the There is No Limit Foundation which is working directly with the First Lady of Guinea&rsquo;s foundation on the ground in Guinea. Also, to leave no stones unturned we are working in partnering with more organizations on the ground. We want to ensure that any helpful solution we come up with gets implemented!   Everything done through this hackathon is intended to be open-source.
