They let us chat via web cams, send e-mails from cell phones, and withdraw cash from ATMs. But computer-based devices and information networks aren&rsquo;t the only products computer engineers develop; they reconstruct genomes, design robots, and develop software to make businesses more efficient. That&rsquo;s just the kind of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship that the School of Engineering encourages.   Our BS program in Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET ( www.abet.org ). The program has a comprehensive analysis and design curriculum that provides an outstanding, cutting-edge education in computer systems with emphasis on hardware and software, The program incorporates the latest market and technology trends and combines the traditional disciplines of electronics, communications, control and computer programming with newer courses, such as Cyber Security, Nanoscale Circuit Design, Parallel Computers, Image Processing, Biomedical Instrumentation, Web Search Engines, Wireless Networks, Peer-to-Peer Networks, SoC (System-on-a-Chip), VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and Game Development.   Recognizing the need for well-rounded engineers, we also emphasize strong communication and interpersonal skills. Our students develop these skills not only through required courses in the humanities and social sciences but also during team projects in design classes. Sponsored research and affiliate programs at our Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT), and Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Lab also put you in constant contact with alumni and instructors whose experience in the industry you can draw upon.   Graduates of our program have gone on to design microchips and computer graphics, monitor and control industrial plants, and develop embedded hardware/software systems. They also occupy positions in manufacturing, research, financial services, health, and government, or create their own companies.   With departmental permission, you may earn a single bachelor&rsquo;s degree in electrical and computer engineering. This degree requires a minimum of 142 credits rather than the typical 128 required for individual bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.   Program Educational Objectives   The broad objectives of the Computer Engineering Program are:      Graduates are expected to be engaged and advancing in their professional careers in a profession that utilizes their NYU Polytechnic degree, in Computer Engineering or other career path, that include industry, academia, and governmental or non-governmental organizations.    Graduates are expected to be seeking continuous professional development and life-long learning through graduate school studies, continuing education credits and/or professional registration.

They let us chat via web cams, send e-mails from cell phones, and withdraw cash from ATMs. But computer-based devices and information networks aren&rsquo;t the only products computer engineers develop; they reconstruct genomes, design robots, and develop software to make businesses more efficient. That&rsquo;s just the kind of invention, innovation, and entrepreneurship that the School of Engineering encourages.   Our BS program in Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET ( www.abet.org ). The program has a comprehensive analysis and design curriculum that provides an outstanding, cutting-edge education in computer systems with emphasis on hardware and software, The program incorporates the latest market and technology trends and combines the traditional disciplines of electronics, communications, control and computer programming with newer courses, such as Cyber Security, Nanoscale Circuit Design, Parallel Computers, Image Processing, Biomedical Instrumentation, Web Search Engines, Wireless Networks, Peer-to-Peer Networks, SoC (System-on-a-Chip), VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and Game Development.   Recognizing the need for well-rounded engineers, we also emphasize strong communication and interpersonal skills. Our students develop these skills not only through required courses in the humanities and social sciences but also during team projects in design classes. Sponsored research and affiliate programs at our Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT), and Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Lab also put you in constant contact with alumni and instructors whose experience in the industry you can draw upon.   Graduates of our program have gone on to design microchips and computer graphics, monitor and control industrial plants, and develop embedded hardware/software systems. They also occupy positions in manufacturing, research, financial services, health, and government, or create their own companies.   With departmental permission, you may earn a single bachelor&rsquo;s degree in electrical and computer engineering. This degree requires a minimum of 142 credits rather than the typical 128 required for individual bachelor&rsquo;s degrees.   Program Educational Objectives   The broad objectives of the Computer Engineering Program are:      Graduates are expected to be engaged and advancing in their professional careers in a profession that utilizes their NYU Polytechnic degree, in Computer Engineering or other career path, that include industry, academia, and governmental or non-governmental organizations.    Graduates are expected to be seeking continuous professional development and life-long learning through graduate school studies, continuing education credits and/or professional registration.

ABET competencies a, c, e, k. 4.00 Credits Fundamentals of Electric Circuits II EE-UY 2024 The course continues EE2013 and focuses on sinusoidal steady-state response; complex voltage and current and the phasor concept; impedance and admittance; average, apparent and reactive power; polyphase circuits; node and mesh analysis for AC circuits; use of Matlab for solving circuit equations; frequency response; parallel and series resonance; and operational amplifier circuits. A laboratory meets on alternate weeks. A minimum of C- is required to take other EE courses. Prerequisites: EE-UY 2013 with C or better grade. ABET competencies a, b, c, d, e, k. 4.00 Credits Digital Logic and State Machine Design CS-UY 2204 This course covers combinational and sequential digital circuits. Topics: Introduction to digital systems. Number systems and binary arithmetic. Switching algebra and logic design. Error detection and correction. Combinational integrated circuits, including adders. Timing hazards. Sequential circuits, flipflops, state diagrams and synchronous machine synthesis. Programmable Logic Devices, PLA, PAL and FPGA. Finite-state machine design. Memory elements. A grade of C or better is required of undergraduate computer-engineering majors. Prerequisite: CS-UY 1114 (C- or better) or CS-UY 1133 (C- or better). ABET competencies: a, c, e, k. 4.00 Credits Introduction to Embedded Systems Design EE-UY 4144 The course covers architecture and operation of embedded microprocessors; microprocessor assembly language programming; address decoding; interfacing to static and dynamic RAM; Serial I/O, Parallel I/O, analog I/O; interrupts and direct memory access; A/D and D/A converters; sensors; microcontrollers. Alternate-week laboratory. Objectives: to provide foundations of embedded systems design and analysis techniques; expose students to system level design; and teach integration of analog sensors with digital embedded microprocessors. Prerequisites: CS-UY 2204 (C- or better) and EE-UY 2024 (C- or better). ABET competencies: a, c, d, e, g, j, k.   For students not earning the BS degree in computer science, EE 4144 may be replaced by CS 2214 Computer Architecture. You must take a minimum of 8 credits at the School of Engineering. Students for whom CS1133/CS1114 is not required for major should note that CS 1133/CS 1114 is a prerequisite for CS 2204. The minor in computer engineering is not open to students earning the BS degree in electrical engineering.
