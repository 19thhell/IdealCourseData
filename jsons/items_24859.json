In 1989, the Department of Counselor Education and the Department of Educational Psychology were merged into the current Department of Applied Psychology.    The major philosophical principles underlying the doctoral program in Counseling Psychology at NYU Steinhardt are: 1) a focus on a developmental understanding of clients; 2) a commitment to a health and wellness model of intervention and research; 3) an appreciation of the gendered, cultural, class, and institutional context of people's lives as these affect both clients and counselors.    We consider these principles to be central to our definition of Counseling Psychology.    The goals of our program are to:       produce graduates who are knowledgeable regarding current clinical theory    produce graduates who understand adaptive and maladaptive human functioning across the lifespan    produce graduates who are prepared to function as multi-faceted and multi-skilled professionals in a wide range of roles as counseling psychologists    produce graduates whose professional identity is that of a counseling psychologist and who are able acquire additional knowledge appropriate to this specialty    produce graduates who have attained awareness, knowledge, skills, and attitudes to work effectively with, and conduct research, about the lives of individuals from diverse backgrounds, particularly in urban settings    produce graduates who have developed a high level of ethical sensitivity and behavior in their professional roles as researchers and practitioners    produce graduates who are knowledgeable about the research process and the creation of new knowledge       Read more about student admissions, outcomes, and other data.

The major philosophical principles underlying the doctoral program in Counseling Psychology at NYU Steinhardt are: 1) a focus on a developmental understanding of clients; 2) a commitment to a health and wellness model of intervention and research; 3) an appreciation of the gendered, cultural, class, and institutional context of people's lives as these affect both clients and counselors.    We consider these principles to be central to our definition of Counseling Psychology.    The goals of our program are to:       produce graduates who are knowledgeable regarding current clinical theory    produce graduates who understand adaptive and maladaptive human functioning across the lifespan    produce graduates who are prepared to function as multi-faceted and multi-skilled professionals in a wide range of roles as counseling psychologists    produce graduates whose professional identity is that of a counseling psychologist and who are able acquire additional knowledge appropriate to this specialty    produce graduates who have attained awareness, knowledge, skills, and attitudes to work effectively with, and conduct research, about the lives of individuals from diverse backgrounds, particularly in urban settings    produce graduates who have developed a high level of ethical sensitivity and behavior in their professional roles as researchers and practitioners    produce graduates who are knowledgeable about the research process and the creation of new knowledge       Read more about student admissions, outcomes, and other data.
