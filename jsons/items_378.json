From the House of the Scribes, Dura-Europos, 200\u2013256 CE. Yale University Art Gallery, Yale-French Excavations at Dura-Europos: 1933.292. Photography \u00a9 2011 Yale University Art Gallery.     Edge of Empires vividly illustrates the international,\u00a0pluralistic character of\u00a0 Dura-Europos , a city strategically located high above the Euphrates River, between Syria and Mesopotamia. The exhibition focuses on its final phase, in the third century CE, when Dura-Europos served as an important Roman stronghold on the empire\u2019s eastern edge. Many of the objects on view demonstrate the coexistence of multiple religions\u2014including polytheistic cults, Judaism, and Christianity\u2014the great variety of languages employed by its population, and its role as an international military garrison.
