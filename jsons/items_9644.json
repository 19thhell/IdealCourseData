Critical Perspectives on History, Politics, and Culture , NYU-CLACS is hosting a discussion with Melanie Newton. In this first event of the series, Newton will examine race and indigeneity in her lecture, \u201cThe Race Leapt at Sauteurs: Genocide, Narrative, and Indigenous Exile from the Caribbean.\u201d    Newton will explore the relationship between historical narrative and genocidal processes through an examination of the southeastern Caribbean\u2019s own particular version of the narrative of the \"vanished Amerindian.\" She will focus on three real historical events \u2013 the first encounter in 1493 between Columbus and a group of 'Caribs' in Hispaniola; the 1651 French defeat of a Carib force in Grenada, and the 1797 exile of the \"Black Caribs\" from St. Vincent.
