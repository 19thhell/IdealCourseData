Regardless of your family's financial circumstances, paying for college will probably require a substantial commitment of your resources over the next several years. It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

Review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of your financial aid awards .   If you have been awarded Federal Direct Loans, be sure to read our instructions to secure those Direct Loans . These instructions are applicable also to returning students who may have borrowed federal loans in the past. You are encouraged to review the definitions of the loans before pursuing these or any educational loan. Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long term financial commitments, when borrowing.   Read the Financial Aid Guide , which provides essential information to accompany your NYU financial aid award package for the academic year.   Students must meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress to remain eligible for financial aid. Be sure to follow the requirements of your program/department.

Regardless of your family's financial circumstances, paying for college will probably require a substantial commitment of your resources over the next several years. It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

Review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of your financial aid awards .   If you have been awarded Federal Direct Loans, be sure to read our instructions to secure those Direct Loans . These instructions are applicable also to returning students who may have borrowed federal loans in the past. You are encouraged to review the definitions of the loans before pursuing these or any educational loan. Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long term financial commitments, when borrowing.   Read the Financial Aid Guide , which provides essential information to accompany your NYU financial aid award package for the academic year.   Students must meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress to remain eligible for financial aid. Be sure to follow the requirements of your program/department.

NYU requires the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application (for new freshmen only, to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid), the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid), and, for residents of New York State, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) application.       Go to Applications and Forms for complete instructions       Student Aid Report (SAR)  When your FAFSA information has been processed you will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) from the U.S. Department of Education. Review it for accuracy, be sure that all required sections are complete, and verify that federal school number 002785 is indicated for New York University. Follow the SAR instructions to make changes or corrections if necessary (e.g. final income tax return information). Do not send it to NYU. Once the corrections are received by the federal processor, a final SAR will be sent to you for your records. You may view your SAR record and make changes on the FAFSA website .   NYU Award Package  Once you are officially admitted to NYU, if you are eligible we will send to you an official notification that describes your total financial aid package and details the types and amounts of student aid offered to you for the school year. Be sure to read our Financial Aid Guide , which describes the various forms of aid and reviews the components of your package.   Scholarships  There is no separate application for NYU scholarships. All students are automatically considered for academic (merit-based) and financial need-based scholarships upon their application for admission and financial aid. Scholarship awards are based on eligibility and the availability of funds.     Go to Scholarships and Grants     Loans  A financial aid package at NYU may suggest several types of loans for which a student is eligible, based on certain criteria (such as anticipated points/credits, housing status, financial need, etc.) and, for campus-administered loans, the availability of funds.     Go to Types of Financial Aid     Requests for Documentation: Tax Information and Income Verification  It is not necessary to submit copies of your tax returns or any other family financial records or supporting documentation to the Office of Financial Aid unless you are specifically requested to provide additional information.     Go to Policies: Eligibility for Financial Aid at NYU                Publications   From the NYU Office of Financial Aid:     Financial Aid Guide  The Financial Aid Guide provides essential information to accompany the NYU financial aid package awarded for the academic year.
