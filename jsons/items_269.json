Doctoral Program in Biological Anthropology The research and training program in our department   is distinguished by its unique commitment to integrating   laboratory-based and field-based research. We have state-of-the-art   laboratories in genetics and molecular systematics, and in   paleoanthropology, with superb facilities for both research and teaching   in these areas. In addition, faculty and students are conducting   primatological and paleoanthropological research at sites in South   America, Asia and Africa.   Click here for more information.  Masters Program in Biological Anthropology - Human Skeletal Biology This two year program prepares graduates to apply the principles and techniques of skeletal biology and genetic research in Biological Anthropology to a variety of contexts, including those in the Forensic Sciences (i.e., Medical Examiner\u2019s office, Coroner\u2019s office, Armed Forces, Criminal Justice, Law Enforcement, Mass Disasters). The program can also be useful training for students who are preparing for admission to doctoral programs in bioarchaeology, skeletal biology and human evolution. Program includes 36 points of coursework, a laboratory or field internship, and a research-based M.A. thesis.

The faculty   also believes that basic ethnography remains the cornerstone on which   all cultural anthropology rests and are concerned with the   representation of anthropological knowledge in writing and film.
