In fact, international students, defined by NYU as students who do not hold citizenship or permanent residency status in the United States, comprise roughly 16% of the most recent entering class on our New York campus. There are, however, important notes for international students to consider when applying for admission:       Financial aid to international students on our New York campus is only available for incoming freshmen. If offered admission, international students will be required to submit a certification of finances demonstrating that they will be able to fund their four years of study through a combination of their own funds and any financial assistance we may provide. Students should not submit a certification of finances or bank statements until after they are offered admission.     All applicants, regardless of citizenship, must apply online. Students outside the U.S. who must send application documents (e.g. diplomas, transcripts, etc.) in hardcopy form are strongly encouraged to do so well in advance of our stated application deadlines.     NYU does not consider undergraduate admissions applications from students who already possess a bachelor's degree in any academic area, with the exception of Nursing and all majors offered through the School of Engineering. (Students interested in a second bachelor's degree in Nursing may click here for information. Students interested in a second bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering may click here for more information.)     International students may be required to submit TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE Academic results as proof of English language proficiency. Please review the English language proficiency section of the Standardized Tests page of our website for more information.       All applicants to NYU, regardless of citizenship, are held to the same admissions standards, and evaluated on the same admissions criteria.                                                                                          A note about certification of finances:                               It is not necessary for you to submit financial documents with your application. The New York University Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE), will be available online to students who are offered admission and who pay the enrollment deposit. All non-U.S. Citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents must file the AFCOE and submit appropriate evidence of their ability to finance their education before certificates for student visas (Form I-20) or exchange visitor visas (Form DS-2019) can be issued.   If you are admitted to NYU and your studies will be financed with your own savings, parental support, outside private or government scholarships, or any combination of these, you will need to send official letters or similar certificates as proof of such support. You will need to include your name and date of birth on each document you submit.   If you are currently in the United States at the time of your admission, you must submit a copy of your I-94 card. Please note that students holding F-1 or J-1 student visas are generally not allowed to work in the United States to earn money toward their education and are required to pursue a full-time course load each semester.

In fact, international students, defined by NYU as students who do not hold citizenship or permanent residency status in the United States, comprise roughly 16% of the most recent entering class on our New York campus. There are, however, important notes for international students to consider when applying for admission:       Financial aid to international students on our New York campus is only available for incoming freshmen. If offered admission, international students will be required to submit a certification of finances demonstrating that they will be able to fund their four years of study through a combination of their own funds and any financial assistance we may provide. Students should not submit a certification of finances or bank statements until after they are offered admission.     All applicants, regardless of citizenship, must apply online. Students outside the U.S. who must send application documents (e.g. diplomas, transcripts, etc.) in hardcopy form are strongly encouraged to do so well in advance of our stated application deadlines.     NYU does not consider undergraduate admissions applications from students who already possess a bachelor's degree in any academic area, with the exception of Nursing and all majors offered through the School of Engineering. (Students interested in a second bachelor's degree in Nursing may click here for information. Students interested in a second bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering may click here for more information.)     International students may be required to submit TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE Academic results as proof of English language proficiency. Please review the English language proficiency section of the Standardized Tests page of our website for more information.       All applicants to NYU, regardless of citizenship, are held to the same admissions standards, and evaluated on the same admissions criteria.                                                                                          A note about certification of finances:                               It is not necessary for you to submit financial documents with your application. The New York University Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE), will be available online to students who are offered admission and who pay the enrollment deposit. All non-U.S. Citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents must file the AFCOE and submit appropriate evidence of their ability to finance their education before certificates for student visas (Form I-20) or exchange visitor visas (Form DS-2019) can be issued.   If you are admitted to NYU and your studies will be financed with your own savings, parental support, outside private or government scholarships, or any combination of these, you will need to send official letters or similar certificates as proof of such support. You will need to include your name and date of birth on each document you submit.   If you are currently in the United States at the time of your admission, you must submit a copy of your I-94 card. Please note that students holding F-1 or J-1 student visas are generally not allowed to work in the United States to earn money toward their education and are required to pursue a full-time course load each semester.

Congratulations! Follow these steps to learn how to get your F-1 or J-1 visa and enter the U.S. in student status.                                                                                                       Watch our YouTube video on Coming to the U.S. to see an overview of the process!                                      Step 1: Receive your admission letter (or electronic version) from NYU.   To be eligible for NYU sponsorship of F-1 or J-1 student status, you need to be accepted to a full-time academic program at NYU and have an official admission notice from NYU along with an NYU University ID number. You are not eligible for NYU sponsorship if your program of study consists of only online courses. If you are not yet admitted to NYU and have questions about how to apply, please visit NYU Admissions .            Step 2: Activate your NYU NetID and NYU Email.     If you don\u2019t already know your NetID, learn your NYU NetID .   If you already know your NetID, go to start.nyu.edu to activate it.   Enter your NetID and click the \u201cStart!\u201d button.              Step 3: Decide if you will apply for F-1 or J-1 status.   In order to study at NYU, you will need to obtain a student status for the U.S. NYU sponsors international students for either F-1 or J-1 student status. Read about your options below and decide which status works best for you.                                                    What is F-1?                               F-1 status is the most common type of status used to study in the United States. F-1 status is for full-time academic and language students who are pursuing a degree or certificate. If you decide on F-1 status, you will need to apply for an I-20.   If you plan to bring your spouse with you, he or she will need to obtain a F-2 dependent I-20 from NYU. F-2 dependents may not work in the U.S. and may not enroll in school.                                                                What is J-1?                               In order to be a J-1 student at NYU, at least half of your funding must come from a source other than personal or family funds. If you decide on J-1 status, you will need to apply for a DS-2019.   If you plan to bring your spouse with you, he or she will need to get a J-2 dependent DS-2019 from NYU. Please note that J-2 dependents may apply for work permission and may study in the U.S.                          Step 4: Pay tuition deposit to the NYU Admissions Office for school you will attend.              Step 5: Complete your I-20 or DS-2019 Application   The I-20/DS-2019 Application is interactive and fillable online.       Complete it online, print it, sign it, then scan it.

How long does it normally take to get an I-20/DS-2019 from NYU once I apply?

Do F-1 and J-1 students need health insurance to study at NYU?

You can find detailed information on the NYU Health Insurance Website and should view the International Students section for important information.                                                                                                                                                                          How can my dependents (spouse and children) come with me to the U.S.?

Can my domestic partner come with me to the U.S.?                                                       Domestic partners can apply for a B-1/B-2 visa to accompany you. Though B-2 visas are normally for short duration, it is possible for your partner to accompany you for the duration of your academic program in the U.S. Your partner would need to demonstrate his or her intent to depart the U.S. at the conclusion of your stay.                                                                                                                                                                        How do I make my visa interview appointment?

What happens if my visa is denied?                                                       If you receive a visa denial, request a denial letter from the U.S. Consulate so that you will understand why your visa was denied. The main reason visas are denied for the U.S. is failure of the applicant to prove they have ties to their home country.

What happens if my visa is delayed?                                                       Some students may face visa delays due to security checks based on your field of study, name check or country of birth, citizenship, or nationality. Most security checks are handled within 30 days. If yours takes longer, email newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu with the details of the date and city of your visa application.
