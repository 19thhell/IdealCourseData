The program seeks to integrate content mastery with teaching materials in order to provoke inquiry-based learning. It also aims to familiarize students with urban educational environments and enables them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. The pivotal experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. M.A. students, mentored by their cooperating teachers, NYU-filed supervisors and methods teachers, are given responsibility for teaching in New York City and public schools. Extensive school-based fieldwork is required prior to student teaching. This program is open to both full-time and part-time students.    Because of reciprocity agreements with other states those certified by New York state are able to teach in most other U.S. states.

The program seeks to integrate content mastery with teaching materials in order to provoke inquiry-based learning. It also aims to familiarize students with urban educational environments and enables them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. The pivotal experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. M.A. students, mentored by their cooperating teachers, NYU-filed supervisors and methods teachers, are given responsibility for teaching in New York City and public schools. Extensive school-based fieldwork is required prior to student teaching. This program is open to both full-time and part-time students.    Because of reciprocity agreements with other states those certified by New York state are able to teach in most other U.S. states.

The program seeks to integrate content mastery with teaching materials in order to provoke inquiry-based learning. It also aims to familiarize students with urban educational environments and enables them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. The pivotal experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. M.A. students, mentored by their cooperating teachers, NYU-filed supervisors and methods teachers, are given responsibility for teaching in New York City and public schools. Extensive school-based fieldwork is required prior to student teaching. This program is open to both full-time and part-time students.    Because of reciprocity agreements with other states those certified by New York state are able to teach in most other U.S. states.

We are known for our broad view of the discipline, and understand \"literature\" to mean writing in all media, and its study to include all the ways in which texts have been produced, re-produced, circulated, and read, along with the modes of classification and the definitions of enjoyment used to understand them. The scholarly methods we employ, and in which we train our students, include close reading, historical and archival research, literary theory, the history of the book, media theory, and cultural analysis.

It also aims to familiarize students with urban educational environments and enables them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. The pivotal experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. M.A. students, mentored by their cooperating teachers, NYU-filed supervisors and methods teachers, are given responsibility for teaching in New York City and public schools. Extensive school-based fieldwork is required prior to student teaching. This program is open to both full-time and part-time students.
