Her  first book, Police Aesthetics: Literature, Film and The Secret Police , a  study of the relationships between cultural and policing practices in twentieth  century Eastern Europe, was published by Stanford University Press. Taking  advantage of the partial opening of the secret police archives in Russia and  Romania, Police Aesthetics focuses on their most infamous holdings\u2014the  personal files\u2014as well as on the agency's less known involvement with cinema.  Two articles stemming from this project, \"Arresting Biographies: The  Secret Police File in The Soviet Union and Romania,\" and \"Politics of  Estrangement: Tracking Shklovsky's Device in Literary and Policing  Practices\" have been published in Comparative Literature and Poetics  Today . Vatulescu's current project is a crosscultural exploration of the  interplay of documents and fictions in twentieth century cinema, literature, as  well as in legal texts and practices. A first installment of this project,  titled \u201c\u2018The Face to Face Encounter of Art and Law:\u2019 Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s Close-up,\u201d   was published in Law and Literature.
