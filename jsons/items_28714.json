Computer Science is part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences . My research focuses on machine learning and probabilistic inference, with a particular focus on applications to clinical medicine. For example, we are developing algorithms to learn probabilistic models for medical diagnosis directly from unstructured clinical data, automatically discovering and predicting latent (hidden) variables. We collaborate with the   Emergency Medicine Informatics Research Lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and with Independence Blue Cross .     Previously, I was a post-doc  at Microsoft  Research New England . My Ph.D. is in Computer Science from MIT , where I worked with Tommi Jaakkola on approximate inference and learning in probabilistic models. My bachelors degree is from UC  Berkeley , in Computer  Science , where I worked with Stuart Russell 's First-Order Probabilistic Logic group.
