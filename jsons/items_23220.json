The Schack family has donated a $10 million cash gift\u0097the largest in the School\u0092s history\u0097to provide critical support for students, faculty, research, and physical infrastructure. The contribution is the lead gift in a campaign to build a permanent endowment for the 40-year-old Institute, the University\u0092s home for applied research, graduate study, and continuing professional education in real estate, construction management, and related fields.  The campaign will be announced at the Institute\u0092s annual Urban Leadership Dinner on June 24th at the Waldorf=Astoria. The dinner marks the close of the 40th anniversary year of the Institute. Past and present supporters of the Institute will be honored\u0097including past presidents of its powerhouse industry Advisory Board, like NYU Trustee Larry Silverstein, who led the founding of the Institute at NYU four decades ago.  A Transformational Gift from a Longtime NYC Real Estate Family  The Schack family has been a significant presence in the New York real estate community and within New York University for three generations. Samuel Schack, founder of the original family business Schack & Schack Real Estate, graduated from the NYU School of Law in 1902. He and his son Leonard were active in Manhattan and the Bronx, specializing in the residential, loft, and secondary office markets. Their firm bought and sold properties, which it managed and leased. Leonard\u0092s son Kenneth, a 1970 graduate of the NYU School of Commerce (now the NYU Leonard Stern School of Business), has owned and run his own real estate company, Schack Realty Co. Inc., for over two decades. He is a past chairman of the Young Men\u0092s/Women\u0092s Real Estate Association of New York and received the group\u0092s \u0093Senior Man of the Year\u0094 award in 2000. His sister Linda Schack Teitelbaum is a 1963 graduate of the NYU Washington Square College. \u0093We are profoundly grateful and honored by the trust and respect for the work of the Institute and SCPS that the Schack family has manifested through this transformative act of generosity,\u0094 said NYU-SCPS Dean Robert S. Lapiner. \u0093Their gift will help secure the Institute\u0092s ambitions for ever greater academic innovation, achievement, and global engagement. The University is proud to embrace the Schack family by renaming one of our premier centers of excellence the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate.\u0094 \u0093Our family is honored to play a part in the ongoing evolution of the real estate industry by strengthening the Institute\u0092s efforts to advance its curriculum, attract the highest-caliber professors and students, and maintain its leadership position for education in the field,\u0094 said Kenneth Schack. \u0093As real estate professionals, we have participated in and observed the dramatic transformation of the business in the past four decades. Now, advanced education in such subjects as financial analysis, portfolio and risk management, law, land use, and economics as well as a developed global focus are required for success in real estate. And, we believe that there is no better place to receive that education than the Institute at New York University.\u0094 The timing of the donation is of special, personal significance to Kenneth Schack, his sister, and their families. \u0093We wanted to make a gift that honored our grandparents Goldie and Samuel Schack and our parents,\u0094 he explained. \u0093Our late father Leonard would have marked his 100th birthday this year, and our mother Lola recently celebrated her 93rd birthday. We knew that the timing was right to do this now and the gift to NYU in support of the Institute was the best, most appropriately public honor to them all\u0097one that would celebrate their lives and professional legacies for years and decades to come.\u0094 \u0093NYU was first conceived in the 19th century,\u0094 said NYU President John Sexton, \u0093as an institution that would spread higher learning more democratically and respond to New York\u0092s emerging middle and merchant classes by equipping them with students with knowledge and skills that would enable them not only to learn but to prosper. The School of Continuing and Professional Studies is NYU\u0092s direct connection with those originating principles. And, this generous and thoughtful gift from the Schack family reflects not only the stature that the Real Estate Institute has achieved within the field, but the same commitment to professional education that animated NYU\u0092s founders.\u0094  Schack Gift Launches Campaign for Greater Industry Support  James D. Kuhn, president of Newmark Knight Frank and chairman of the Institute\u0092s Advisory Board, has known Kenneth Schack professionally for many years. \u0093Dean Lapiner and I, with the full support of NYU\u0092s leadership, were determined to raise an endowment deserving of the finest real estate program in the country,\u0094 said Kuhn. \u0093However, through the generosity of Ken Schack and his family, our timetable has been greatly accelerated. We hope this is only the beginning.\u0094 Last month, Kuhn and his wife Marjorie announced their own innovative leadership gift of $1 million to the Institute, to create The James and Marjorie Kuhn Program to Foster Diversity in Real Estate. D. Kenneth Patton, divisional dean of the Institute and the Klara and Larry Silverstein Chair of Real Estate Development, is especially pleased about the impact of the Schack family gift. \u0093We are particularly honored that the gift recognizes the Institute as an unmatched resource for the education and development of real estate leaders and for its four decades of advancing the academic and professional standards for an entire industry,\u0094 he said.  Support for Faculty, Research, Student Support, and Facility Enhancements  Founded in 1967, the Institute has evolved in tandem with its changing industry from a small, locally focused program into a global center of higher education and applied research. The Institute offers graduate programs in real estate and construction management, enrolls more than 5,000 annually in its continuing professional education courses, and hosts \u0093must attend\u0094 annual industry-wide conferences on REITs and real estate capital markets.  The Schack family gift and the larger campaign to create a permanent endowment for the Schack Institute will help it build upon this estimable record and support its future growth and aspirations. In coming years, the Schack Institute seeks to appoint additional fulltime clinical professors, attract distinguished visiting scholars, and provide greater support to the leading industry practitioners who serve as adjunct faculty. To address the increased complexity of the field and keep the curriculum ahead of these changes, the Schack Institute will expand its applied research capacity to benefit the industry and its students. Further, the Institute will increase it globally focused activities\u0097research and field work abroad, exchanges with foreign universities, conferences, and the like. The seminars, conferences, and other events sponsored by the Institute underscore its public role as \u0093first responder\u0094 on breaking real estate developments and host to experts on such issues as ethics, property rights, and sustainability. The Institute hopes to fund an expanded program of these activities, as well as upgrade its conference spaces and classrooms to provide better venues for its events and courses. The Schack Institute\u0092s well-regarded graduate programs increasingly draw applications for admission from top graduates of leading colleges and universities, both here and abroad. To continue attracting these students\u0097as well as ensuring a diverse student body\u0097the Institute will dedicate resources to scholarships, academic prizes, and other student support structures.
