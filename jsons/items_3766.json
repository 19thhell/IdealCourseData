IPE offers training in Child and Adolescent      Psychoanalysis. Graduates of this program are eligible for certification      as a child and adolescent analyst by the American Psychoanalytic Association.      Staffed by a highly qualified faculty      of child and adolescent analysts , a number of whom are leaders      in the field, the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychoanalysis has      gained a national reputation for the quality of its educational program.        The curriculum includes didactic instruction in the theory and technique      of child and adolescent psychoanalysis, continuous case seminars, and      supervised psychoanalytic work.       Eligibility           Admission is open to graduates and candidates of institutes      of the American Psychoanalytic Association and institutes affiliated      with the International Psychoanalytical Association. Candidates in adult      psychoanalytic training who are interested in child analysis may concurrently      attend a monthly ongoing child seminar, and may apply to join the child training program. Although candidates are best prepared to enter the child program after completing two years of the adult program, applicants may be considered for admission earlier in their adult training, depending on their previous professional experience.       Components of Training      Seminars      The Child Program course work consists of two years of classes conducted on a weekly      basis for three trimesters. The training program is integrated with      the Institute's Division of Adult Psychoanalysis so that many prerequisites      for child training are covered in the candidate's four years of adult      classes. Child courses given in the adult program include theoretical      and clinical courses on child development and treatment, psychoanalytic      theories of development, and infant and child observation. Pre-latency,      latency, and adolescent stages of development are covered in the adult      classes on developmental theory, clinical technique, and case conferences.      Candidates and graduates from other institutes who wish to enter the      Child and Adolescent program can discuss their training curriculum with      the Division Chair prior to entering the program in order to insure      that they have been exposed to core courses in developmental concepts      in their adult program.      Supervised Clinical Work      Candidates treat a minimum of three cases (pre-latency, latency, and      adolescent) in supervised analyses. It is highly desirable for candidates      in the child and adolescent program to be in a personal analysis when      they begin this clinical work. Institute candidates      in the Adult Division who enter the child program may, with the approval      of the Student Progression committee and the Child Progression Committee,      begin a supervised child or adolescent analytic case at any point during      their adult classes.       Graduation Requirements      Graduation requirements from the Child and Adolescent Program are similar      to those in the Division of Adult Psychoanalysis: analytic maturity      and the capacity for independent analytic work. This includes having      successfully completed the didactic curriculum and demonstrated analytic      competence in supervised and unsupervised clinical work with at least      three cases (as evidenced by supervisors' written evaluations and the      candidate's own written summaries of his or her cases). A terminated      case is not required. It is essential that at least one of the candidate's      current cases is headed for satisfactory termination.           Fees and Tuition       Annual Tuition: $650       Fees for Child Psychoanalytic Supervision:      Fees for supervision are arranged with and paid directly to the training      or supervising analyst. Training and supervising analysts will consider      reductions in their standard fees.       Continuing Medical Education Statement:      This activity (training program) has been planned and implemented in accordance with the Essential Areas and policies of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education through the joint sponsorship of the American Psychoanalytic Association and the Institute for Psychoanalytic Education. The American Psychoanalytic Association is accredited by the ACCME to provide continuing medical education for physicians.       The American Psychoanalytic Association designates this Live Activity for a maximum of 1 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit per hour of instruction. Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.

The goal of the program is to train and prepare child and adolescent psychiatrists to meet the challenging demands of a complex and expanding field while translating research into effective clinical care. Graduating residents have the necessary knowledge and clinical skills to function independently as medical specialists in coordinating and delivering skilled and comprehensive treatment to children and adolescents who have psychiatric disorders.   The child and adolescent psychiatry program at NYU is one of the oldest in the country with a longstanding tradition of combining clinical and research excellence. The multi-disciplinary faculty of behavioral scientists and clinicians is committed to providing state-of-the-art care in their quest to assist children, adolescents and their families.   The NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the Rockland Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center (RCPC) offer a unique combination of comprehensive clinical facilities serving diverse patient populations. Residents gain clinical experience at Bellevue on the Child Inpatient Service (the first in the United States); the Adolescent Inpatient Service (also the first in the country); the Adolescent Day Hospital; the Pediatric Emergency Service; Public School 35M (one of the first public school programs established in a hospital); the Child and Adolescent Mental Hygiene Clinic (which includes a Therapeutic Nursery/Preschool); and the Pediatric Consultation-Liaison Service. At NYU there are clinical opportunities at Tisch Hospital's inpatient Young Adult Program; pediatric consultation liaison activities at Tisch Hospital, Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, and Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders; and the varied components of the NYU Child Study Center. First year child residents also rotate at RCPC, an intensive, family-based inpatient program, where they learn to psychiatrically diagnose and treat some of the most troubled and disruptive children in the state.   This comprehensive didactic/supervisory program offers year-long seminars on child and adolescent development and psychopathology as well as two years of psychopharmacology; continuous case seminars (by members of the NYU Psychoanalytic Institute) and seminars in assessment; research; treatment modalities; forensics; ethics; substance abuse; and other related child and adolescent mental health issues. NYU Child Study Center holds one of the few weekly grand rounds in child and adolescent psychiatry in the country. At these presentations residents hear from national experts each week and then meet with the speaker for lunch immediately afterwards, providing more opportunities for learning, mentorship, and future collaboration.   The Family Studies Program, in collaboration with the Ackerman Institute of Family Therapy, offers a first-year didactic seminar and two years of weekly live family therapy supervision. Second-year residents also have weekly group and cognitive behavior therapy supervision. Individual long-term therapy supervision is provided throughout the two years along with individual supervision by attending on clinical rotations.   The Department has one of seven federally funded Research Units for Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP).

IPE offers training in Child and Adolescent      Psychoanalysis. Graduates of this program are eligible for certification      as a child and adolescent analyst by the American Psychoanalytic Association.      Staffed by a highly qualified faculty      of child and adolescent analysts , a number of whom are leaders      in the field, the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychoanalysis has      gained a national reputation for the quality of its educational program.        The curriculum includes didactic instruction in the theory and technique      of child and adolescent psychoanalysis, continuous case seminars, and      supervised psychoanalytic work.       Eligibility           Admission is open to graduates and candidates of institutes      of the American Psychoanalytic Association and institutes affiliated      with the International Psychoanalytical Association. Candidates in adult      psychoanalytic training who are interested in child analysis may concurrently      attend a monthly ongoing child seminar, and may apply to join the child training program. Although candidates are best prepared to enter the child program after completing two years of the adult program, applicants may be considered for admission earlier in their adult training, depending on their previous professional experience.       Components of Training      Seminars      The Child Program course work consists of two years of classes conducted on a weekly      basis for three trimesters. The training program is integrated with      the Institute's Division of Adult Psychoanalysis so that many prerequisites      for child training are covered in the candidate's four years of adult      classes. Child courses given in the adult program include theoretical      and clinical courses on child development and treatment, psychoanalytic      theories of development, and infant and child observation. Pre-latency,      latency, and adolescent stages of development are covered in the adult      classes on developmental theory, clinical technique, and case conferences.      Candidates and graduates from other institutes who wish to enter the      Child and Adolescent program can discuss their training curriculum with      the Division Chair prior to entering the program in order to insure      that they have been exposed to core courses in developmental concepts      in their adult program.      Supervised Clinical Work      Candidates treat a minimum of three cases (pre-latency, latency, and      adolescent) in supervised analyses. It is highly desirable for candidates      in the child and adolescent program to be in a personal analysis when      they begin this clinical work. Institute candidates      in the Adult Division who enter the child program may, with the approval      of the Student Progression committee and the Child Progression Committee,      begin a supervised child or adolescent analytic case at any point during      their adult classes.       Graduation Requirements      Graduation requirements from the Child and Adolescent Program are similar      to those in the Division of Adult Psychoanalysis: analytic maturity      and the capacity for independent analytic work. This includes having      successfully completed the didactic curriculum and demonstrated analytic      competence in supervised and unsupervised clinical work with at least      three cases (as evidenced by supervisors' written evaluations and the      candidate's own written summaries of his or her cases). A terminated      case is not required. It is essential that at least one of the candidate's      current cases is headed for satisfactory termination.           Fees and Tuition       Annual Tuition: $650       Fees for Child Psychoanalytic Supervision:      Fees for supervision are arranged with and paid directly to the training      or supervising analyst. Training and supervising analysts will consider      reductions in their standard fees.

The goal of the program is to train and prepare child and adolescent psychiatrists to meet the challenging demands of a complex and expanding field while translating research into effective clinical care. Graduating residents have the necessary knowledge and clinical skills to function independently as medical specialists in coordinating and delivering skilled and comprehensive treatment to children and adolescents who have psychiatric disorders.   The child and adolescent psychiatry program at NYU is one of the oldest in the country with a longstanding tradition of combining clinical and research excellence. The multi-disciplinary faculty of behavioral scientists and clinicians is committed to providing state-of-the-art care in their quest to assist children, adolescents and their families.   The NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, and the Rockland Children\u2019s Psychiatric Center (RCPC) offer a unique combination of comprehensive clinical facilities serving diverse patient populations. Residents gain clinical experience at Bellevue on the Child Inpatient Service (the first in the United States); the Adolescent Inpatient Service (also the first in the country); the Adolescent Day Hospital; the Pediatric Emergency Service; Public School 35M (one of the first public school programs established in a hospital); the Child and Adolescent Mental Hygiene Clinic (which includes a Therapeutic Nursery/Preschool); and the Pediatric Consultation-Liaison Service. At NYU there are clinical opportunities at Tisch Hospital's inpatient Young Adult Program; pediatric consultation liaison activities at Tisch Hospital, Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, and Stephen D. Hassenfeld Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders; and the varied components of the NYU Child Study Center. First year child residents also rotate at RCPC, an intensive, family-based inpatient program, where they learn to psychiatrically diagnose and treat some of the most troubled and disruptive children in the state.   This comprehensive didactic/supervisory program offers year-long seminars on child and adolescent development and psychopathology as well as two years of psychopharmacology; continuous case seminars (by members of the NYU Psychoanalytic Institute) and seminars in assessment; research; treatment modalities; forensics; ethics; substance abuse; and other related child and adolescent mental health issues. NYU Child Study Center holds one of the few weekly grand rounds in child and adolescent psychiatry in the country. At these presentations residents hear from national experts each week and then meet with the speaker for lunch immediately afterwards, providing more opportunities for learning, mentorship, and future collaboration.   The Family Studies Program, in collaboration with the Ackerman Institute of Family Therapy, offers a first-year didactic seminar and two years of weekly live family therapy supervision. Second-year residents also have weekly group and cognitive behavior therapy supervision. Individual long-term therapy supervision is provided throughout the two years along with individual supervision by attending on clinical rotations.   The Department has one of seven federally funded Research Units for Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP). Residents are welcome to participate in ongoing research through RUPP or the many other ongoing research studies at the NYU Child Study Center, Bellevue Hospital Center, or RCPC.

The didactics include weekly seminars that are exclusively for the psychology interns, as well as ongoing departmental rounds, lectures, and case conferences that are held in conjunction with the postdoctoral fellowship and psychiatric residency programs. Topics and formats of these seminars are varied, in order to balance the intern's developing clinical experience with didactic and case presentations.     Seminar leaders and presenters include faculty and supervisors from NYU-Bellevue, as well as psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers who are affiliated with other institutions or who are in private practice in the metropolitan area. Seminars incorporate a wide range of topics including ethics, psychopharmacology, cross-cultural issues, neuropsychological assessment, psychoanalytic, cognitive and behavioral therapy, family and group psychotherapy and an array of other topics relevant to the practice of contemporary psychology.
