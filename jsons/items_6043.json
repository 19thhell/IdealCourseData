Caregivers are available to either &quot;live-in&quot; in your home or &quot;live out&quot; and come to your home each day. Individuals working in this capacity are referred to as nanny, housekeeper, in-home care provider, or babysitter.   Average Cost     Full time nannies in NYC are paid weekly. Rates for nannies vary depending upon the community in which care is provided. In the Washington Square Village area full-time nannies earn $500/week on average. Part time nannies usually earn $15/hour. Families who hire a full time in-home provider must also consider the expense of paying taxes and some decide to cover the cost of health insurance for the care provider. Meals, money for transportation and bonuses may also contribute to the cost of hiring an in-home care provider.   Defining Your Needs     When looking for a nanny, you will want to think about several key aspects of care.     What hours do you expect your nanny to work?     Will the schedule remain fairly consistent or do you need a nanny whose time is very flexible?   Are you looking for a nanny who will live in your home?     What household responsibilities do you want the nanny to perform?     What kind of experience or background would you like your nanny to have?       Most nannies are asked to actively engage children throughout the day with activities and local outings. Some families expect their nanny to perform some housekeeping duties such as meal preparation and laundry. While helpful a nanny's time spent completing these task will have less time to spend directly interacting with the children. Clarifying your expectations before you hire a nanny will help you find someone who is a good fit.   Hiring a Nanny     Once you have a clear idea of what your nanny's duties will be, start looking around. You can locate a nanny through an agency, through friends and colleagues, or placing and looking at ads online, in newspapers, or at local stores and schools. NYU's Employee Assistance Program, Carebridge Life Resources , (800-437-0911) can help you with referrals to local placement agencies. When you identify a potential nanny, start with a phone conversation. If the conversation goes well, set up an interview so you can get to know her better.   The Interview     The interview is your chance to ask about the candidate's experience with children and to find out if her expectations for the job are in line with your expectations. Some families include their children in the interview process to observe how the nanny interacts with them and seek their opinions when making a hiring decision.                                          Information on        Hiring a Babysitter                                    Additional Resources     Tips for Hiring a Babysitter     Carebridge Life Resources can help you write a job description, identify newspapers, in-home care agencies, and other referral sources.   Park Slope Parents , an on-line parenting resource, offers a comprehensive guide on recruiting, hiring, and paying for a nanny on the books. Focus groups provide local information about wages and best practices.                Check References   No matter where you find your nanny, and no matter how well the interview goes, always ask for and check references. Unlike child care centers and family child care homes, in-home caregivers are not regulated or monitored by any government agency. If you are using a nanny agency, they may perform background and reference checks for you however it is commonly advised that you should complete your own reference checks.     Sample Reference Check (PDF)     Establish an Agreement   If you are happy with the results of the reference check, it is time to make an offer, and sign an employment contract or agreement. By signing a contract, you make certain that you and your nanny are clear about the terms of employment, including pay, hours, time off (i.e. holidays, vacation, and sick days), and responsibilities. A nanny agency may have its own contracts for you to use. Or, you may choose from among the print and online sample contracts. Be sure to go back and revisit the contract or agreement from time to time as the needs of your family and your nanny may change.   Getting Started   When you and your nanny agree to a start date, be sure to plan to spend some time in the home with her and your child. This time will provide a good opportunity for all of you. It will enable you to get to know your nanny better and to help her know your family's and child's routines and establish a strong relationship that is so important to a successful situation.

The following is a summary of key regulations in New York. Links to regulations for family child care services in New York State, New Jersey, and Connecticut are listed in the right hand column.   Family Child Care   Family child care is an on-going arrangement in which child care is provided in someone's home on a regular basis for children aged 8 weeks through school-age for more than 3 hours per day per child.     Staff to Child Ratio   Individuals caring for 2 children or less are exempt from the licensing system.   Family Child Care - In a regulated family child care home, the provider may care for up to six children at one time, including the provider's own children under the age of 12 years.     If ANY children under 2 years of age, the maximum number in care is 5.     Group Family Child Care - A group family child care provider must have at least one assistant present during the hours care is provided. A group family child care provider and her assistant may care for 7 to 12 children at one time, including the provider's own children under the age of 12 years.     No more than 4 children under the age of 2 years may be in care at any time;  and no more than 6 children under the age of 3 years can be cared for at any one time.   If ANY children are under 2 years of age, the maximum number in care is 10.     If there are NO children under 2 years of age, the maximum number in care is 12.     Average Cost     The cost for family child care varies depending upon neighborhood. In NYC, the average cost of full-time care costs approximately $800/month. In the Greenwich Village area, the cost averages $1,800/month.     General Requirements of Staff and Other Adults     Screening - Any adult working, or in regular contact, with children must: submit three references, a recent medical form, including the results of a TB test, certify that they have never been convicted of a felony, submit fingerprints, and be screened through the NYS Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment. The NYS Office of Children and Families shall perform a criminal history record check of each.     Provider Qualifications - All providers must be at least 18 years of age and attend an orientation conducted by the NYC Department of Health and must have a minimum of 2 years of experience caring for children under the age of 6 years, or one year experience caring for children under 6 years of age, plus 6 hous of training or education in early childhood development.     Training Requirements - Ongoing professional development is part of an individual's commitment to working with children. Prior to registration each provider, assistant, and alternative provider must complete 15 hours of training plus a minimum of 15 additional hours during the first 6 months of registration for a total of 30 hours during the first year of registration. A total of 30 hours of training must be completed every two years. Training hours must be documented and verifiable.   General Licensing and Facility Requirements     Facility Requirements     The family child care home must meet safety requirements, including electrical outlet covers, window guards or locking devices, a fire extinguisher, smoke detectors, covered radiators and pipes, and a fully equipped first aid kit. Family child care home must have two means of egress, excluding fire escapes.   Inspections     Scheduled inspection by an educational consultant and a fire safety inspector from the NYC Department of Health is required before registration or licensing and for any renewal thereafter.

Caregivers are available to either &quot;live-in&quot; in your home or &quot;live out&quot; and come to your home each day. Individuals working in this capacity are referred to as nanny, housekeeper, in-home care provider, or babysitter.   Average Cost     Full time nannies in NYC are paid weekly. Rates for nannies vary depending upon the community in which care is provided. In the Washington Square Village area full-time nannies earn $500/week on average. Part time nannies usually earn $15/hour. Families who hire a full time in-home provider must also consider the expense of paying taxes and some decide to cover the cost of health insurance for the care provider. Meals, money for transportation and bonuses may also contribute to the cost of hiring an in-home care provider.   Defining Your Needs     When looking for a nanny, you will want to think about several key aspects of care.     What hours do you expect your nanny to work?     Will the schedule remain fairly consistent or do you need a nanny whose time is very flexible?   Are you looking for a nanny who will live in your home?     What household responsibilities do you want the nanny to perform?     What kind of experience or background would you like your nanny to have?       Most nannies are asked to actively engage children throughout the day with activities and local outings. Some families expect their nanny to perform some housekeeping duties such as meal preparation and laundry. While helpful a nanny's time spent completing these task will have less time to spend directly interacting with the children. Clarifying your expectations before you hire a nanny will help you find someone who is a good fit.   Hiring a Nanny     Once you have a clear idea of what your nanny's duties will be, start looking around. You can locate a nanny through an agency, through friends and colleagues, or placing and looking at ads online, in newspapers, or at local stores and schools. NYU's Employee Assistance Program, Carebridge Life Resources , (800-437-0911) can help you with referrals to local placement agencies. When you identify a potential nanny, start with a phone conversation. If the conversation goes well, set up an interview so you can get to know her better.   The Interview     The interview is your chance to ask about the candidate's experience with children and to find out if her expectations for the job are in line with your expectations. Some families include their children in the interview process to observe how the nanny interacts with them and seek their opinions when making a hiring decision.                                          Information on        Hiring a Babysitter                                    Additional Resources     Tips for Hiring a Babysitter     Carebridge Life Resources can help you write a job description, identify newspapers, in-home care agencies, and other referral sources.   Park Slope Parents , an on-line parenting resource, offers a comprehensive guide on recruiting, hiring, and paying for a nanny on the books. Focus groups provide local information about wages and best practices.                Check References   No matter where you find your nanny, and no matter how well the interview goes, always ask for and check references. Unlike child care centers and family child care homes, in-home caregivers are not regulated or monitored by any government agency. If you are using a nanny agency, they may perform background and reference checks for you however it is commonly advised that you should complete your own reference checks.     Sample Reference Check (PDF)     Establish an Agreement   If you are happy with the results of the reference check, it is time to make an offer, and sign an employment contract or agreement. By signing a contract, you make certain that you and your nanny are clear about the terms of employment, including pay, hours, time off (i.e. holidays, vacation, and sick days), and responsibilities. A nanny agency may have its own contracts for you to use. Or, you may choose from among the print and online sample contracts. Be sure to go back and revisit the contract or agreement from time to time as the needs of your family and your nanny may change.   Getting Started   When you and your nanny agree to a start date, be sure to plan to spend some time in the home with her and your child. This time will provide a good opportunity for all of you. It will enable you to get to know your nanny better and to help her know your family's and child's routines and establish a strong relationship that is so important to a successful situation.

The following is a summary of key regulations in New York. Links to regulations for family child care services in New York State, New Jersey, and Connecticut are listed in the right hand column.   Family Child Care   Family child care is an on-going arrangement in which child care is provided in someone's home on a regular basis for children aged 8 weeks through school-age for more than 3 hours per day per child.

If ANY children under 2 years of age, the maximum number in care is 5.     Group Family Child Care - A group family child care provider must have at least one assistant present during the hours care is provided. A group family child care provider and her assistant may care for 7 to 12 children at one time, including the provider's own children under the age of 12 years.     No more than 4 children under the age of 2 years may be in care at any time;  and no more than 6 children under the age of 3 years can be cared for at any one time.
