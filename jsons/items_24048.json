Second-year students can take courses in evidence or criminal procedure. Most law schools have only one course in criminal procedure\u2014at NYU, students can choose from four. Myriad upper-level advanced courses in substantive and procedural criminal law include Business Crime, Federal Criminal Law, and Juvenile Justice. There are also many seminars to choose from and eight hands-on clinics offered in criminal law.   A Variety of Approaches   The sociology of crime and punishment fascinates Professors David Garland, James Jacobs, and Jerome Skolnick. Garland, the author of the seminal The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in the Contemporary Society , virtually invented the field of the sociology of punishment, while Jacobs and Skolnick, co-directors of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice , are experts on organized crime and the sociology of policing, respectively. Jacobs has taught Criminal Procedure, Federal Criminal Law, and Juvenile Justice. Professor Anthony Thompson takes a more hands-on sociological approach: He is the founder of the country\u2019s first Community Reentry and Reintegration Clinic, now part of the Criminal Defense and Reentry Clinic , one of the eight criminal law clinics available to students.   Applying the lessons and theory of administrative law to the administration of criminal justice is Professor Rachel Barkow\u2019s specialty. Given the list of important criminal justice decisions made outside the courtroom\u2014plea bargains, charging decisions, sentencing guidelines, and parole board rulings, among others\u2014Barkow, a leading sentencing scholar, has much material to mine.

She delights in learning the ins and outs of the latest new thing, whether functional MRI imaging for lie detection, facial recognition software or other biometric technologies, or GPS location trackers.   Professors Jennifer Arlen '86 and Kevin Davis focus on crime in connection with the field of law and economics. Arlen engages in economic analysis of corporate criminal liability, while Davis takes an active interest in transnational anti-corruption law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and has written extensively on the impact of that body of law on both multinational firms and developing countries.   International Perspective   The criminal law program has a very strong international dimension that benefits from interdisciplinary perspectives. Professors David Golove, Stephen Holmes, Richard Pildes, and Samuel Rascoff, the faculty co-directors of the Center on Law and Security , take on terrorism. Professor Jerome Cohen leads a course on Chinese law and society. Professor Holly Maguigan runs the Comparative Criminal Justice Clinic. Professor Davis is interested in the law of development and has written on transnational bribery. Professor Theodor Meron, on leave serving as president of both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, is an expert in international criminal law. Professor Ronald Noble, also on leave, is currently serving his third term as secretary general of Interpol.   Constitutional Considerations   From gun control (Jacobs\u2019s specialty) to capital punishment (Amsterdam, Garland, and Stevenson\u2019s area), constitutional issues are front and center within the study of criminal law at NYU. Professor Stephen Schulhofer, a co-author of the leading casebook on criminal law, is also author of Rethinking the Patriot Act: Ideas for Reform and an authority on the high cost of security. Professors Bryan Stevenson and Anthony Amsterdam are legendary figures in the world of death penalty litigation, as well as active teachers and scholars.

Hertz and Professor Martin Guggenheim '71 are also authorities on juvenile justice. Professor Kim Taylor-Thompson is a national leader on indigent defense.   Corporate Crime and Financial Misdealing   NYU also has the leading program in corporate crime and financial misdealing, benefiting from faculty who are the leading experts in corporate criminal enforcement, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, securities fraud, financial institution regulation, and legal issues relating to mortgage-backed securities. Jennifer Arlen, director of the Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement, teaches Business Crime and an advanced seminar on business crime. Kevin Davis is a leading expert on foreign corruption and its effect on developing countries. Stephen Choi, a prominent scholar of securities fraud, co-authored a leading casebook on securities. An expert on financial institutions, Geoffrey Miller wrote a book illuminating the structural roots of the 2008-09 global financial crisis and co-authored the leading casebook on banking and financial institutions. Marcel Kahan studies securities fraud, while Harry First wrote the first law school casebook on business crime. Rachel Barkow published a book on using criminal law to regulate corporate conduct.   Learning from the Experts   The criminal law program benefits from the expertise and teaching excellence of four long-time adjunct professors. Federal District Court Judge John Gleeson, formerly chief of the organized crime unit in the US Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York, teaches seminars on complex criminal investigations and sentencing. Ronald Goldstock, former director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force and former inspector general of the US Department of Labor, teaches seminars on organized crime control and corruption control. James Orenstein \u201987, United States magistrate judge and former federal prosecutor, teaches seminars on complex criminal investigations (with Gleeson) and on ethics in criminal justice administration. S. Andrew Schaffer, a former assistant US attorney in Manhattan and currently the deputy commissioner for legal matters for the New York City Police Department, teaches criminal procedure.   More on the Criminal Law program from the NYU Law Magazine.   Center on the Administration of Criminal Law Fellowship   The 13 student fellows are involved in all aspects of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law's work. During the two-year fellowship, they conduct research to support the center\u2019s academic, litigation, and policy work. Fellows have the opportunity to co-author articles and other works of scholarship, and help plan and organize conferences and other events involving prominent legal scholars and practitioners.   Corporate Compliance and Enforcement Fellowship   Each year, three to four students receive a fellowship from the Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement to work with Professor Jennifer Arlen on her ongoing research projects. Students are expected to co-write articles and research memos. They also help organize and participate in the program's annual conference on corporate crime and financial misdealing.   Criminal Justice Fellowship   The Criminal Justice Fellowship is for a second-year student who wants to collaborate with Professor James Jacobs on one of his ongoing research projects. The fellow receives three academic credits and a $7,500 stipend over two years. Each fellow is expected to co-write an article or book. Jacobs, who has written or co-written 15 books, has worked with students on topics ranging from organized crime to drug testing.

It has a simple goal : enabling the federal government to check the immigration status of every single person arrested for a crime by local police. NYU Law Professor Adam Cox and University of Chicago Law School Professor Thomas J. Miles are working on a large-scale empirical study of the program: its goals, its consequences for crime rates, and its intended and unintended effects on local policing. The first two papers from their study are available below. Additional findings and papers will be available here in the coming months.     Does Immigration Enforcement Reduce Crime? Evidence from \u201cSecure Communities\u201d   Forthcoming The Journal of Law and Economics , November 2014   Abstract. Does immigration enforcement actually reduce crime? Surprisingly, little evidence exists either way\u2014despite the fact that deporting noncitizens who commit crimes has been a central feature of American immigration law since the early twentieth century. We capitalize on a natural policy experiment to address the question and, in the process, provide the first empirical analysis of the most important deportation initiative to be rolled out in decades. The policy initiative we study is \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to enable the federal government to check the immigration status of every person arrested for a crime by local police. Before this program, the government checked the immigration status of only a small fraction of arrestees. Since its launch, the program has led to over a quarter of a million detentions. We exploit the slow rollout of the program across more than 3,000 US counties to isolate the effect of Secure Communities on local crime rates. Moreover, we refine those estimates using rich data on the number of immigrants detained under the program in each county and month \u2014 data obtained from the federal government through extensive FOIA requests. Our results show that Secure Communities led to no meaningful reductions in the FBI index crime rate. Nor has it reduced rates of violent crime \u2014 homicides, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault. This evidence shows that the program has not served its central objective of making communities safer.   Download the paper.     Policing Immigration   80 University of Chicago Law Review 87 (2013)   Abstract. Immigration enforcement is increasingly integrated with local policing. This trend accelerated in 2008 when the federal government launched \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to check the immigration status of every person arrested by local police. The government views the program as an innovation that enhances the efficacy of crime control and immigration enforcement, while civil rights groups have decried it as an invitation to racial profiling by local police. This paper uses the pattern of Secure Communities\u2019 rollout to evaluate the central role that enforcement discretion plays in modern immigration law. Constrained by limited resources, the federal government staggered the activation of Secure Communities across more than 3,000 US counties, rolling the program out over a period of four years. The rollout\u2019s pattern provides a revealing look at the federal government\u2019s priorities in a world where simultaneous nationwide activation was impossible. The data call into question the government\u2019s claim that a central priority of the program was to make communities more secure from crime by deporting noncitizens who commit crimes. Moreover, the fact that early activation in the program correlates strongly with whether a county has a large Hispanic population raises important questions about demographic profiling in immigration enforcement.

It has a simple goal : enabling the federal government to check the immigration status of every single person arrested for a crime by local police. NYU Law Professor Adam Cox and University of Chicago Law School Professor Thomas J. Miles are working on a large-scale empirical study of the program: its goals, its consequences for crime rates, and its intended and unintended effects on local policing. The first two papers from their study are available below. Additional findings and papers will be available here in the coming months.     Does Immigration Enforcement Reduce Crime? Evidence from \u201cSecure Communities\u201d   Forthcoming The Journal of Law and Economics , November 2014   Abstract. Does immigration enforcement actually reduce crime? Surprisingly, little evidence exists either way\u2014despite the fact that deporting noncitizens who commit crimes has been a central feature of American immigration law since the early twentieth century. We capitalize on a natural policy experiment to address the question and, in the process, provide the first empirical analysis of the most important deportation initiative to be rolled out in decades. The policy initiative we study is \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to enable the federal government to check the immigration status of every person arrested for a crime by local police. Before this program, the government checked the immigration status of only a small fraction of arrestees. Since its launch, the program has led to over a quarter of a million detentions. We exploit the slow rollout of the program across more than 3,000 US counties to isolate the effect of Secure Communities on local crime rates. Moreover, we refine those estimates using rich data on the number of immigrants detained under the program in each county and month \u2014 data obtained from the federal government through extensive FOIA requests. Our results show that Secure Communities led to no meaningful reductions in the FBI index crime rate. Nor has it reduced rates of violent crime \u2014 homicides, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault. This evidence shows that the program has not served its central objective of making communities safer.   Download the paper.     Policing Immigration   80 University of Chicago Law Review 87 (2013)   Abstract. Immigration enforcement is increasingly integrated with local policing. This trend accelerated in 2008 when the federal government launched \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to check the immigration status of every person arrested by local police. The government views the program as an innovation that enhances the efficacy of crime control and immigration enforcement, while civil rights groups have decried it as an invitation to racial profiling by local police. This paper uses the pattern of Secure Communities\u2019 rollout to evaluate the central role that enforcement discretion plays in modern immigration law. Constrained by limited resources, the federal government staggered the activation of Secure Communities across more than 3,000 US counties, rolling the program out over a period of four years. The rollout\u2019s pattern provides a revealing look at the federal government\u2019s priorities in a world where simultaneous nationwide activation was impossible. The data call into question the government\u2019s claim that a central priority of the program was to make communities more secure from crime by deporting noncitizens who commit crimes. Moreover, the fact that early activation in the program correlates strongly with whether a county has a large Hispanic population raises important questions about demographic profiling in immigration enforcement.

In May, federal prosecutors sent a signal that no bank is too big to escape criminal sanctions, when they pressured Credit Suisse's parent company to plead guilty to conspiracy to aid and assist U.S. taxpayers file false tax returns; the bank paid $2.6 billion, the highest amount ever in a criminal tax case. Later in the summer, BNP Paribas agreed to pay $8.9 billion for illegally processing financial transactions for countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions. The move came after BNP separately pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and filing false business records in New York state court. These convictions were made possible, in part, by coordinated enforcement between the U.S. Attorney's office, New York Attorney General and New York Department of Financial Services. Join us for an in-depth discussion of how these convictions came about and what they portend for the future. The panelists included four people who were on the front lines, both for the prosecution and the defense. View full program here .

In May, federal prosecutors sent a signal that no bank is too big to escape criminal sanctions, when they pressured Credit Suisse's parent company to plead guilty to conspiracy to aid and assist U.S. taxpayers file false tax returns; the bank paid $2.6 billion, the highest amount ever in a criminal tax case. Later in the summer, BNP Paribas agreed to pay $8.9 billion for illegally processing financial transactions for countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions. The move came after BNP separately pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and filing false business records in New York state court. These convictions were made possible, in part, by coordinated enforcement between the U.S. Attorney's office, New York Attorney General and New York Department of Financial Services. Join us for an in-depth discussion of how these convictions came about and what they portend for the future. The panelists included four people who were on the front lines, both for the prosecution and the defense. View full program here .

Second-year students can take courses in evidence or criminal procedure. Most law schools have only one course in criminal procedure\u2014at NYU, students can choose from four. Myriad upper-level advanced courses in substantive and procedural criminal law include Business Crime, Federal Criminal Law, and Juvenile Justice. There are also many seminars to choose from and eight hands-on clinics offered in criminal law.   A Variety of Approaches   The sociology of crime and punishment fascinates Professors David Garland, James Jacobs, and Jerome Skolnick. Garland, the author of the seminal The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in the Contemporary Society , virtually invented the field of the sociology of punishment, while Jacobs and Skolnick, co-directors of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice , are experts on organized crime and the sociology of policing, respectively. Jacobs has taught Criminal Procedure, Federal Criminal Law, and Juvenile Justice. Professor Anthony Thompson takes a more hands-on sociological approach: He is the founder of the country\u2019s first Community Reentry and Reintegration Clinic, now part of the Criminal Defense and Reentry Clinic , one of the eight criminal law clinics available to students.   Applying the lessons and theory of administrative law to the administration of criminal justice is Professor Rachel Barkow\u2019s specialty. Given the list of important criminal justice decisions made outside the courtroom\u2014plea bargains, charging decisions, sentencing guidelines, and parole board rulings, among others\u2014Barkow, a leading sentencing scholar, has much material to mine. Her work has explored the mechanisms of administrative oversight of law enforcement, including through jury nullification and sentencing commissions.   Professor Erin Murphy's work focuses on the intersection between new technology and the criminal justice system. An expert in DNA evidence, Murphy often collaborates with faculty in the sciences and social sciences. She delights in learning the ins and outs of the latest new thing, whether functional MRI imaging for lie detection, facial recognition software or other biometric technologies, or GPS location trackers.   Professors Jennifer Arlen '86 and Kevin Davis focus on crime in connection with the field of law and economics. Arlen engages in economic analysis of corporate criminal liability, while Davis takes an active interest in transnational anti-corruption law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and has written extensively on the impact of that body of law on both multinational firms and developing countries.   International Perspective   The criminal law program has a very strong international dimension that benefits from interdisciplinary perspectives. Professors David Golove, Stephen Holmes, Richard Pildes, and Samuel Rascoff, the faculty co-directors of the Center on Law and Security , take on terrorism. Professor Jerome Cohen leads a course on Chinese law and society. Professor Holly Maguigan runs the Comparative Criminal Justice Clinic. Professor Davis is interested in the law of development and has written on transnational bribery. Professor Theodor Meron, on leave serving as president of both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, is an expert in international criminal law. Professor Ronald Noble, also on leave, is currently serving his third term as secretary general of Interpol.   Constitutional Considerations   From gun control (Jacobs\u2019s specialty) to capital punishment (Amsterdam, Garland, and Stevenson\u2019s area), constitutional issues are front and center within the study of criminal law at NYU. Professor Stephen Schulhofer, a co-author of the leading casebook on criminal law, is also author of Rethinking the Patriot Act: Ideas for Reform and an authority on the high cost of security. Professors Bryan Stevenson and Anthony Amsterdam are legendary figures in the world of death penalty litigation, as well as active teachers and scholars. (Read profiles of Stevenson and Amsterdam in the NYU Law Magazine .) Professors Barry Friedman and Randy Hertz are experts in habeas corpus and criminal procedure. Hertz and Professor Martin Guggenheim '71 are also authorities on juvenile justice. Professor Kim Taylor-Thompson is a national leader on indigent defense.   Corporate Crime and Financial Misdealing   NYU also has the leading program in corporate crime and financial misdealing, benefiting from faculty who are the leading experts in corporate criminal enforcement, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, securities fraud, financial institution regulation, and legal issues relating to mortgage-backed securities. Jennifer Arlen, director of the Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement, teaches Business Crime and an advanced seminar on business crime. Kevin Davis is a leading expert on foreign corruption and its effect on developing countries. Stephen Choi, a prominent scholar of securities fraud, co-authored a leading casebook on securities. An expert on financial institutions, Geoffrey Miller wrote a book illuminating the structural roots of the 2008-09 global financial crisis and co-authored the leading casebook on banking and financial institutions. Marcel Kahan studies securities fraud, while Harry First wrote the first law school casebook on business crime. Rachel Barkow published a book on using criminal law to regulate corporate conduct.   Learning from the Experts   The criminal law program benefits from the expertise and teaching excellence of four long-time adjunct professors. Federal District Court Judge John Gleeson, formerly chief of the organized crime unit in the US Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York, teaches seminars on complex criminal investigations and sentencing. Ronald Goldstock, former director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force and former inspector general of the US Department of Labor, teaches seminars on organized crime control and corruption control. James Orenstein \u201987, United States magistrate judge and former federal prosecutor, teaches seminars on complex criminal investigations (with Gleeson) and on ethics in criminal justice administration. S. Andrew Schaffer, a former assistant US attorney in Manhattan and currently the deputy commissioner for legal matters for the New York City Police Department, teaches criminal procedure.   More on the Criminal Law program from the NYU Law Magazine.   Center on the Administration of Criminal Law Fellowship   The 13 student fellows are involved in all aspects of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law's work. During the two-year fellowship, they conduct research to support the center\u2019s academic, litigation, and policy work. Fellows have the opportunity to co-author articles and other works of scholarship, and help plan and organize conferences and other events involving prominent legal scholars and practitioners.   Corporate Compliance and Enforcement Fellowship   Each year, three to four students receive a fellowship from the Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement to work with Professor Jennifer Arlen on her ongoing research projects. Students are expected to co-write articles and research memos. They also help organize and participate in the program's annual conference on corporate crime and financial misdealing.   Criminal Justice Fellowship   The Criminal Justice Fellowship is for a second-year student who wants to collaborate with Professor James Jacobs on one of his ongoing research projects. The fellow receives three academic credits and a $7,500 stipend over two years. Each fellow is expected to co-write an article or book. Jacobs, who has written or co-written 15 books, has worked with students on topics ranging from organized crime to drug testing.

It has a simple goal : enabling the federal government to check the immigration status of every single person arrested for a crime by local police. NYU Law Professor Adam Cox and University of Chicago Law School Professor Thomas J. Miles are working on a large-scale empirical study of the program: its goals, its consequences for crime rates, and its intended and unintended effects on local policing. The first two papers from their study are available below. Additional findings and papers will be available here in the coming months.     Does Immigration Enforcement Reduce Crime? Evidence from \u201cSecure Communities\u201d   Forthcoming The Journal of Law and Economics , November 2014   Abstract. Does immigration enforcement actually reduce crime? Surprisingly, little evidence exists either way\u2014despite the fact that deporting noncitizens who commit crimes has been a central feature of American immigration law since the early twentieth century. We capitalize on a natural policy experiment to address the question and, in the process, provide the first empirical analysis of the most important deportation initiative to be rolled out in decades. The policy initiative we study is \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to enable the federal government to check the immigration status of every person arrested for a crime by local police. Before this program, the government checked the immigration status of only a small fraction of arrestees. Since its launch, the program has led to over a quarter of a million detentions. We exploit the slow rollout of the program across more than 3,000 US counties to isolate the effect of Secure Communities on local crime rates. Moreover, we refine those estimates using rich data on the number of immigrants detained under the program in each county and month \u2014 data obtained from the federal government through extensive FOIA requests. Our results show that Secure Communities led to no meaningful reductions in the FBI index crime rate. Nor has it reduced rates of violent crime \u2014 homicides, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault. This evidence shows that the program has not served its central objective of making communities safer.   Download the paper.     Policing Immigration   80 University of Chicago Law Review 87 (2013)   Abstract. Immigration enforcement is increasingly integrated with local policing. This trend accelerated in 2008 when the federal government launched \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to check the immigration status of every person arrested by local police. The government views the program as an innovation that enhances the efficacy of crime control and immigration enforcement, while civil rights groups have decried it as an invitation to racial profiling by local police. This paper uses the pattern of Secure Communities\u2019 rollout to evaluate the central role that enforcement discretion plays in modern immigration law. Constrained by limited resources, the federal government staggered the activation of Secure Communities across more than 3,000 US counties, rolling the program out over a period of four years. The rollout\u2019s pattern provides a revealing look at the federal government\u2019s priorities in a world where simultaneous nationwide activation was impossible. The data call into question the government\u2019s claim that a central priority of the program was to make communities more secure from crime by deporting noncitizens who commit crimes. Moreover, the fact that early activation in the program correlates strongly with whether a county has a large Hispanic population raises important questions about demographic profiling in immigration enforcement.

In May, federal prosecutors sent a signal that no bank is too big to escape criminal sanctions, when they pressured Credit Suisse's parent company to plead guilty to conspiracy to aid and assist U.S. taxpayers file false tax returns; the bank paid $2.6 billion, the highest amount ever in a criminal tax case. Later in the summer, BNP Paribas agreed to pay $8.9 billion for illegally processing financial transactions for countries subject to U.S. economic sanctions. The move came after BNP separately pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and filing false business records in New York state court. These convictions were made possible, in part, by coordinated enforcement between the U.S. Attorney's office, New York Attorney General and New York Department of Financial Services. Join us for an in-depth discussion of how these convictions came about and what they portend for the future. The panelists included four people who were on the front lines, both for the prosecution and the defense. View full program here .

Second-year students can take courses in evidence or criminal procedure. Most law schools have only one course in criminal procedure\u2014at NYU, students can choose from four. Myriad upper-level advanced courses in substantive and procedural criminal law include Business Crime, Federal Criminal Law, and Juvenile Justice. There are also many seminars to choose from and eight hands-on clinics offered in criminal law.   A Variety of Approaches   The sociology of crime and punishment fascinates Professors David Garland, James Jacobs, and Jerome Skolnick. Garland, the author of the seminal The Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in the Contemporary Society , virtually invented the field of the sociology of punishment, while Jacobs and Skolnick, co-directors of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice , are experts on organized crime and the sociology of policing, respectively. Jacobs has taught Criminal Procedure, Federal Criminal Law, and Juvenile Justice. Professor Anthony Thompson takes a more hands-on sociological approach: He is the founder of the country\u2019s first Community Reentry and Reintegration Clinic, now part of the Criminal Defense and Reentry Clinic , one of the eight criminal law clinics available to students.   Applying the lessons and theory of administrative law to the administration of criminal justice is Professor Rachel Barkow\u2019s specialty. Given the list of important criminal justice decisions made outside the courtroom\u2014plea bargains, charging decisions, sentencing guidelines, and parole board rulings, among others\u2014Barkow, a leading sentencing scholar, has much material to mine. Her work has explored the mechanisms of administrative oversight of law enforcement, including through jury nullification and sentencing commissions.   Professor Erin Murphy's work focuses on the intersection between new technology and the criminal justice system. An expert in DNA evidence, Murphy often collaborates with faculty in the sciences and social sciences. She delights in learning the ins and outs of the latest new thing, whether functional MRI imaging for lie detection, facial recognition software or other biometric technologies, or GPS location trackers.   Professors Jennifer Arlen '86 and Kevin Davis focus on crime in connection with the field of law and economics. Arlen engages in economic analysis of corporate criminal liability, while Davis takes an active interest in transnational anti-corruption law, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and has written extensively on the impact of that body of law on both multinational firms and developing countries.   International Perspective   The criminal law program has a very strong international dimension that benefits from interdisciplinary perspectives. Professors David Golove, Stephen Holmes, Richard Pildes, and Samuel Rascoff, the faculty co-directors of the Center on Law and Security , take on terrorism. Professor Jerome Cohen leads a course on Chinese law and society. Professor Holly Maguigan runs the Comparative Criminal Justice Clinic. Professor Davis is interested in the law of development and has written on transnational bribery. Professor Theodor Meron, on leave serving as president of both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, is an expert in international criminal law. Professor Ronald Noble, also on leave, is currently serving his third term as secretary general of Interpol.   Constitutional Considerations   From gun control (Jacobs\u2019s specialty) to capital punishment (Amsterdam, Garland, and Stevenson\u2019s area), constitutional issues are front and center within the study of criminal law at NYU. Professor Stephen Schulhofer, a co-author of the leading casebook on criminal law, is also author of Rethinking the Patriot Act: Ideas for Reform and an authority on the high cost of security. Professors Bryan Stevenson and Anthony Amsterdam are legendary figures in the world of death penalty litigation, as well as active teachers and scholars. (Read profiles of Stevenson and Amsterdam in the NYU Law Magazine .) Professors Barry Friedman and Randy Hertz are experts in habeas corpus and criminal procedure. Hertz and Professor Martin Guggenheim '71 are also authorities on juvenile justice. Professor Kim Taylor-Thompson is a national leader on indigent defense.   Corporate Crime and Financial Misdealing   NYU also has the leading program in corporate crime and financial misdealing, benefiting from faculty who are the leading experts in corporate criminal enforcement, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, securities fraud, financial institution regulation, and legal issues relating to mortgage-backed securities. Jennifer Arlen, director of the Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement, teaches Business Crime and an advanced seminar on business crime. Kevin Davis is a leading expert on foreign corruption and its effect on developing countries. Stephen Choi, a prominent scholar of securities fraud, co-authored a leading casebook on securities. An expert on financial institutions, Geoffrey Miller wrote a book illuminating the structural roots of the 2008-09 global financial crisis and co-authored the leading casebook on banking and financial institutions. Marcel Kahan studies securities fraud, while Harry First wrote the first law school casebook on business crime. Rachel Barkow published a book on using criminal law to regulate corporate conduct.   Learning from the Experts   The criminal law program benefits from the expertise and teaching excellence of four long-time adjunct professors. Federal District Court Judge John Gleeson, formerly chief of the organized crime unit in the US Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York, teaches seminars on complex criminal investigations and sentencing. Ronald Goldstock, former director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force and former inspector general of the US Department of Labor, teaches seminars on organized crime control and corruption control. James Orenstein \u201987, United States magistrate judge and former federal prosecutor, teaches seminars on complex criminal investigations (with Gleeson) and on ethics in criminal justice administration. S. Andrew Schaffer, a former assistant US attorney in Manhattan and currently the deputy commissioner for legal matters for the New York City Police Department, teaches criminal procedure.   More on the Criminal Law program from the NYU Law Magazine.   Center on the Administration of Criminal Law Fellowship   The 13 student fellows are involved in all aspects of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law's work. During the two-year fellowship, they conduct research to support the center\u2019s academic, litigation, and policy work. Fellows have the opportunity to co-author articles and other works of scholarship, and help plan and organize conferences and other events involving prominent legal scholars and practitioners.   Corporate Compliance and Enforcement Fellowship   Each year, three to four students receive a fellowship from the Program on Corporate Compliance and Enforcement to work with Professor Jennifer Arlen on her ongoing research projects. Students are expected to co-write articles and research memos. They also help organize and participate in the program's annual conference on corporate crime and financial misdealing.   Criminal Justice Fellowship   The Criminal Justice Fellowship is for a second-year student who wants to collaborate with Professor James Jacobs on one of his ongoing research projects. The fellow receives three academic credits and a $7,500 stipend over two years. Each fellow is expected to co-write an article or book. Jacobs, who has written or co-written 15 books, has worked with students on topics ranging from organized crime to drug testing.

It has a simple goal : enabling the federal government to check the immigration status of every single person arrested for a crime by local police. NYU Law Professor Adam Cox and University of Chicago Law School Professor Thomas J. Miles are working on a large-scale empirical study of the program: its goals, its consequences for crime rates, and its intended and unintended effects on local policing. The first two papers from their study are available below. Additional findings and papers will be available here in the coming months.     Does Immigration Enforcement Reduce Crime? Evidence from \u201cSecure Communities\u201d   Forthcoming The Journal of Law and Economics , November 2014   Abstract. Does immigration enforcement actually reduce crime? Surprisingly, little evidence exists either way\u2014despite the fact that deporting noncitizens who commit crimes has been a central feature of American immigration law since the early twentieth century. We capitalize on a natural policy experiment to address the question and, in the process, provide the first empirical analysis of the most important deportation initiative to be rolled out in decades. The policy initiative we study is \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to enable the federal government to check the immigration status of every person arrested for a crime by local police. Before this program, the government checked the immigration status of only a small fraction of arrestees. Since its launch, the program has led to over a quarter of a million detentions. We exploit the slow rollout of the program across more than 3,000 US counties to isolate the effect of Secure Communities on local crime rates. Moreover, we refine those estimates using rich data on the number of immigrants detained under the program in each county and month \u2014 data obtained from the federal government through extensive FOIA requests. Our results show that Secure Communities led to no meaningful reductions in the FBI index crime rate. Nor has it reduced rates of violent crime \u2014 homicides, rape, robbery, or aggravated assault. This evidence shows that the program has not served its central objective of making communities safer.   Download the paper.     Policing Immigration   80 University of Chicago Law Review 87 (2013)   Abstract. Immigration enforcement is increasingly integrated with local policing. This trend accelerated in 2008 when the federal government launched \u201cSecure Communities,\u201d a program designed to check the immigration status of every person arrested by local police. The government views the program as an innovation that enhances the efficacy of crime control and immigration enforcement, while civil rights groups have decried it as an invitation to racial profiling by local police. This paper uses the pattern of Secure Communities\u2019 rollout to evaluate the central role that enforcement discretion plays in modern immigration law. Constrained by limited resources, the federal government staggered the activation of Secure Communities across more than 3,000 US counties, rolling the program out over a period of four years. The rollout\u2019s pattern provides a revealing look at the federal government\u2019s priorities in a world where simultaneous nationwide activation was impossible. The data call into question the government\u2019s claim that a central priority of the program was to make communities more secure from crime by deporting noncitizens who commit crimes. Moreover, the fact that early activation in the program correlates strongly with whether a county has a large Hispanic population raises important questions about demographic profiling in immigration enforcement.
