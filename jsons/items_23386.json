Our programs give professionals the knowledge to advance their treatment strategies and improve their approaches and skills when dealing with complicated cases. Including NYU Silver faculty members, a highly experienced cohort of professionals who are actively involved in the most recent and relevant social work research, directs each certificate program. Certificate programs range from 40-80 hours in duration and typically meet in the evening. They require comprehensive journal and text reading, engagement in discussion, and debate about the issues and application. Clinical presentations are integral to learning.

Our programs give professionals the knowledge to advance their treatment strategies and improve their approaches and skills when dealing with complicated cases. Including NYU Silver faculty members, a highly experienced cohort of professionals who are actively involved in the most recent and relevant social work research, directs each certificate program. Certificate programs range from 40-80 hours in duration and typically meet in the evening. They require comprehensive journal and text reading, engagement in discussion, and debate about the issues and application. Clinical presentations are integral to learning. All programs are NYSED accredited.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

Our programs give professionals the knowledge to advance their treatment strategies and improve their approaches and skills when dealing with complicated cases. Including NYU Silver faculty members, a highly experienced cohort of professionals who are actively involved in the most recent and relevant social work research, directs each certificate program. Certificate programs range from 40-80 hours in duration and typically meet in the evening. They require comprehensive journal and text reading, engagement in discussion, and debate about the issues and application. Clinical presentations are integral to learning. All programs are NYSED accredited.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.
