This list will be updated as more courses are reviewed and approved. Please note that course numbers and titles may change.   To search for Gallatin courses that fulfill the Foundation Requirement (liberal arts and historical and cultural requirements), go to the Gallatin Courses page . Please note that individualized projects (i.e. independent studies, tutorials, etc.) do not fulfill any area of the foundation requirement.     Most courses on the list below were offered in prior semesters and may or may not be offered in a future semester. Students should consult the Albert Course Search to see when these courses are offered.   Special Topics courses may in some cases satisfy Gallatin's historical and cultural foundation requirement, but must be considered on a case-by-case basis.To request the review of a Special Topics course, students should complete a Foundation Requirement Petition form .
