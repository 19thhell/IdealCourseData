The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in Economic Theory, Macroeconomics, International Economics, and Economic Growth and Development. Although Economics is a large Department, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paper as an Honors Thesis under direct faculty supervision.    Academic Programs    The Department offers a major in Economics and joint majors in Economics and Mathematics and in Economics and Computer Science. The details are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    The Department's major can be taken in either one of two concentrations, a Theory concentration or, a Policy concentration. The former is for students who desire a more formal approach to economic analysis. The latter is for students who prefer an approach less formal and that emphasize the role of economic institutions and the interplay between policy and theory. Highly motivated students may wish to explore the possibilities of participation in the Department's honors programs, which gives students access to excellent professors in small classes and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis under faculty supervision. Students who plan to go on to advanced degrees in Economics or to law school are strongly encouraged to pursue the Theory concentration, but should consider taking Honors as well. Honors may also be taken in the Policy concentration and eligible students are urged to do so.    Activities and Awards    All students interested in Economics are welcome to join the student-run Undergraduate Economics Society. In the past, the Society has organized a series of guest speakers, visits to local economic institutions, and social activities. The Department also has chapters of two national academic honor societies, Omicron Delta Epsilon and the Honorary Economics Society. The Murray Altman Prize is given to a junior with an outstanding record in Economics and related fields. The Emanuel Stein Memorial Award in Economics goes to a senior for outstanding scholarship in economics.    Career Options    Students majoring in Economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in Economics, business management, or public administration. Pre-professional students will find that an Economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Studying Economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find internships and eventually career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.    Admission and Financial Aid    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

By its very nature, mathematics provides the means to break many problems into manageable pieces that can be analyzed and solved. In fact, mathematical approaches have been central to solving problems and modeling phenomena in a wide array of disciplines. Probability and statistical analysis are fundamental for mapping and analyzing the human genome. Advanced mathematical theories provide the keys to analyzing the risk of rare events, a basic problem of the financial markets. In physics, geometry finds applications to particle physics, to string theory, and to cosmology. In neuroscience, exciting new research into the structure and functioning of the brain relies heavily on the insights provided by mathematical modeling. These are but a few of the contemporary problems relying on mathematical analysis. Mathematical thinking is grounded in rigor and abstraction, but draws its vitality from questions arising in the natural world as well as applications to industry and technology.   Mathematics majors acquire solid foundations in differential and integral calculus, as well as basic concepts of algebra and modern geometry. Students are introduced to classical subjects such as complex and real analysis, abstract algebra, number theory, and topology. Students interested in applications of mathematics to social and physical sciences may pursue courses in numerical methods, theoretical mechanics, probability, dynamical systems, and differential equations.   Mathematics majors at NYUAD attain a breadth of knowledge within the field, pursue their own interests in math electives, explore the role of mathematics as an applied discipline, and undertake a capstone project. The major offers a rigorous and broad foundation in mathematics through seven required courses: Calculus; Linear Algebra; Multivariable Calculus; Ordinary Differential Equations; Real Analysis 1; Introduction to Probability and Statistics; Abstract Algebra 1.     Students select three electives. To attain greater depth in analysis, algebra or calculus, students choose Real Analysis 2, Abstract Algebra 2 or Vector Analysis. The second elective must be a course in applied mathematics, such as Discrete Mathematics, Numerical Methods, Cryptography, Introduction to Mathematical Modeling or Introduction to Game Theory. The third elective may be any other course in mathematics.   Mathematics majors must also complete a concentration in one of the following areas, which use mathematics or mathematical modeling: Computer Science, Economics or the Natural Sciences   Requiring mathematics majors to complete a concentration provides them with a basic knowledge of how math is applied to a specific discipline and is intended to foster the requisite capstone projects in which math majors work closely with students from other areas to solve problems and answer questions.

MATH-AD 102 Introduction to Vector Mathematics                                             A vector is a mathematical measure of change in magnitude and direction of a physical event. A displacement from one location to another in a two or three-dimensional space, and the quantity and direction of force applied to move an object are examples of vectors. This course studies the algebra of vector addition, subtraction, and the dot product and cross product multiplications. The course further provides an in-depth study of trigonometric functions, trigonometric equations and trigonometric identities, including double angle and half angle formulas and their application. The concepts of average rate of change, limit and derivatives for both scalars and vectors in two and three-dimensional coordinates are discussed and the merits of each are presented. Systems of linear equations are presented using matrices. Finite and infinite sequences are discussed. Some basic properties of real and complex numbers are reviewed and several applications of the algebra of complex numbers are presented to illustrate how to use them in applications.    *Prerequiste: MATH-AD 101 or Math Placement.

All existing results from the three fundamental categories of mathematics -- geometry, algebra, and analysis -- can be formally expressed in terms of set theory, predicates, quantifiers and logical connectives. This course explores the axiomatic method, some elements of logic and formal languages, and set theory. In addition, the system of real numbers and all other fundamental number systems can be firmly established on the ground of natural numbers; therefore, the course introduces elementary arithmetic and the universal method of constructing new objects from already known sets by means of equivalence relations. Abstract concepts are introduced through basic but fundamental and universal examples or problems, carefully chosen as illuminants of broader ideas and sources of new theoretical and practical applications.

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

Integration and differentiation of functions of several variables require new concepts and techniques. The course has applications to science and engineering as well as economics. Specific topics include vectors in the plane and space; partial derivatives with applications; double and triple integrals; spherical and cylindrical coordinates; surface and line integrals; and divergence, gradient, and curl. In addition, the theorems of Gauss and Stokes are rigorously introduced.

These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations.

Newton&rsquo;s equations of motion, the rate equations of chemical reactions, the currents flowing in electric circuits, all can be expressed as ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations usually evolve a combination of analytic and numerical methods. The course studies first- and second-order equations, solutions using infinite series, Laplace transforms, linear systems, numerical methods.    *MATH-AD 116 can be taken as a corequisite.

It is further used in other branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and number theory, and also has diverse applications in science and engineering: fluid dynamics, elasticity, nuclear and electrical engineering, to name just a few examples. The geometrical content of analysis in the complex plane is especially appealing. Topics covered include: complex numbers and complex functions; differentiation and the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy&rsquo;s theorem, and the Cauchy integral formula; singularities, residues, Taylor and Laurent series; fractional linear transformations and conformal mapping; analytic continuation and Riemann theorem (time permitting).    *Prerequistes: MATH-AD 112 and MATH-AD 116, or instructor&#39;s approval.

MATH-AD 331 Topology                                             Topology is a major branch of mathematics, which is concerned with the geometry of sets of points in space of arbitrary dimension. One aspect of the subject deals with the classification of sets based upon their structure, not their specific shape. Topology has applications in physics, biology, and dynamical systems. The material includes metric spaces, topological spaces, compactness, connectedness, covering spaces,                                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             MW, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth mathematics capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in Economic Theory, Macroeconomics, International Economics, and Economic Growth and Development. Although Economics is a large Department, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paper as an Honors Thesis under direct faculty supervision.    Academic Programs    The Department offers a major in Economics and joint majors in Economics and Mathematics and in Economics and Computer Science. The details are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    The Department's major can be taken in either one of two concentrations, a Theory concentration or, a Policy concentration. The former is for students who desire a more formal approach to economic analysis. The latter is for students who prefer an approach less formal and that emphasize the role of economic institutions and the interplay between policy and theory. Highly motivated students may wish to explore the possibilities of participation in the Department's honors programs, which gives students access to excellent professors in small classes and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis under faculty supervision. Students who plan to go on to advanced degrees in Economics or to law school are strongly encouraged to pursue the Theory concentration, but should consider taking Honors as well. Honors may also be taken in the Policy concentration and eligible students are urged to do so.    Activities and Awards    All students interested in Economics are welcome to join the student-run Undergraduate Economics Society. In the past, the Society has organized a series of guest speakers, visits to local economic institutions, and social activities. The Department also has chapters of two national academic honor societies, Omicron Delta Epsilon and the Honorary Economics Society. The Murray Altman Prize is given to a junior with an outstanding record in Economics and related fields. The Emanuel Stein Memorial Award in Economics goes to a senior for outstanding scholarship in economics.    Career Options    Students majoring in Economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in Economics, business management, or public administration. Pre-professional students will find that an Economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Studying Economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find internships and eventually career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.    Admission and Financial Aid    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

By its very nature, mathematics provides the means to break many problems into manageable pieces that can be analyzed and solved. In fact, mathematical approaches have been central to solving problems and modeling phenomena in a wide array of disciplines. Probability and statistical analysis are fundamental for mapping and analyzing the human genome. Advanced mathematical theories provide the keys to analyzing the risk of rare events, a basic problem of the financial markets. In physics, geometry finds applications to particle physics, to string theory, and to cosmology. In neuroscience, exciting new research into the structure and functioning of the brain relies heavily on the insights provided by mathematical modeling. These are but a few of the contemporary problems relying on mathematical analysis. Mathematical thinking is grounded in rigor and abstraction, but draws its vitality from questions arising in the natural world as well as applications to industry and technology.   Mathematics majors acquire solid foundations in differential and integral calculus, as well as basic concepts of algebra and modern geometry. Students are introduced to classical subjects such as complex and real analysis, abstract algebra, number theory, and topology. Students interested in applications of mathematics to social and physical sciences may pursue courses in numerical methods, theoretical mechanics, probability, dynamical systems, and differential equations.   Mathematics majors at NYUAD attain a breadth of knowledge within the field, pursue their own interests in math electives, explore the role of mathematics as an applied discipline, and undertake a capstone project. The major offers a rigorous and broad foundation in mathematics through seven required courses: Calculus; Linear Algebra; Multivariable Calculus; Ordinary Differential Equations; Real Analysis 1; Introduction to Probability and Statistics; Abstract Algebra 1.     Students select three electives. To attain greater depth in analysis, algebra or calculus, students choose Real Analysis 2, Abstract Algebra 2 or Vector Analysis. The second elective must be a course in applied mathematics, such as Discrete Mathematics, Numerical Methods, Cryptography, Introduction to Mathematical Modeling or Introduction to Game Theory. The third elective may be any other course in mathematics.   Mathematics majors must also complete a concentration in one of the following areas, which use mathematics or mathematical modeling: Computer Science, Economics or the Natural Sciences   Requiring mathematics majors to complete a concentration provides them with a basic knowledge of how math is applied to a specific discipline and is intended to foster the requisite capstone projects in which math majors work closely with students from other areas to solve problems and answer questions.

This course examines single variable functions, including their algebraic and geometric properties. By necessity, the course begins with a rigorous exploration of the following question: What is a function, and how can it be represented geometrically as a graph? The course delves into standard function manipulations and examines a range of mathematical functions, including polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Placement into Mathematical Functions is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

MATH-AD 102 Introduction to Vector Mathematics                                             A vector is a mathematical measure of change in magnitude and direction of a physical event. A displacement from one location to another in a two or three-dimensional space, and the quantity and direction of force applied to move an object are examples of vectors. This course studies the algebra of vector addition, subtraction, and the dot product and cross product multiplications. The course further provides an in-depth study of trigonometric functions, trigonometric equations and trigonometric identities, including double angle and half angle formulas and their application. The concepts of average rate of change, limit and derivatives for both scalars and vectors in two and three-dimensional coordinates are discussed and the merits of each are presented. Systems of linear equations are presented using matrices. Finite and infinite sequences are discussed. Some basic properties of real and complex numbers are reviewed and several applications of the algebra of complex numbers are presented to illustrate how to use them in applications.    *Prerequiste: MATH-AD 101 or Math Placement.

All existing results from the three fundamental categories of mathematics -- geometry, algebra, and analysis -- can be formally expressed in terms of set theory, predicates, quantifiers and logical connectives. This course explores the axiomatic method, some elements of logic and formal languages, and set theory. In addition, the system of real numbers and all other fundamental number systems can be firmly established on the ground of natural numbers; therefore, the course introduces elementary arithmetic and the universal method of constructing new objects from already known sets by means of equivalence relations. Abstract concepts are introduced through basic but fundamental and universal examples or problems, carefully chosen as illuminants of broader ideas and sources of new theoretical and practical applications.

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

Integration and differentiation of functions of several variables require new concepts and techniques. The course has applications to science and engineering as well as economics. Specific topics include vectors in the plane and space; partial derivatives with applications; double and triple integrals; spherical and cylindrical coordinates; surface and line integrals; and divergence, gradient, and curl. In addition, the theorems of Gauss and Stokes are rigorously introduced.

These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations.

Newton&rsquo;s equations of motion, the rate equations of chemical reactions, the currents flowing in electric circuits, all can be expressed as ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations usually evolve a combination of analytic and numerical methods. The course studies first- and second-order equations, solutions using infinite series, Laplace transforms, linear systems, numerical methods.    *MATH-AD 116 can be taken as a corequisite.

It is further used in other branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and number theory, and also has diverse applications in science and engineering: fluid dynamics, elasticity, nuclear and electrical engineering, to name just a few examples. The geometrical content of analysis in the complex plane is especially appealing. Topics covered include: complex numbers and complex functions; differentiation and the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy&rsquo;s theorem, and the Cauchy integral formula; singularities, residues, Taylor and Laurent series; fractional linear transformations and conformal mapping; analytic continuation and Riemann theorem (time permitting).    *Prerequistes: MATH-AD 112 and MATH-AD 116, or instructor&#39;s approval.

MATH-AD 331 Topology                                             Topology is a major branch of mathematics, which is concerned with the geometry of sets of points in space of arbitrary dimension. One aspect of the subject deals with the classification of sets based upon their structure, not their specific shape. Topology has applications in physics, biology, and dynamical systems. The material includes metric spaces, topological spaces, compactness, connectedness, covering spaces,                                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             MW, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth mathematics capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

Doctoral students take advanced courses in their areas of  specialization, followed by a period of research and the preparation  and defense of the doctoral thesis.       The Graduate Department of Mathematics at the Courant Institute  offers balanced training in mathematics and its applications in the  broadest sense. The Department occupies a leading position in  pure and applied mathematics, especially in ordinary and partial  differential equations, probability theory and stochastic processes,  differential geometry, numerical analysis and scientific computation,  mathematical physics, material science, fluid dynamics, math biology,  Atmosphere and Ocean science, and Computational Biology.       Areas where there are special funding opportunities are:       Mathematics,  Mechanics and Materials Sciences       Number  Theory       Probability       Scientific Computing       The Ph.D. in Mathematics    Degree Requirements    A candidate for the Ph.D. degree in mathematics must fulfill a  number of different departmental requirements:       &#187; 72 points of credit;    &#187; a written comprehensive examination;    &#187; an oral preliminary examination;    &#187; an oral defense of the dissertation.       Coursework    All students in the Ph.D. program must complete 72 points of credits  (24 courses of 3 points each). It is possible, with departmental  permission, to take courses, relevant to students' course of study, in  other departments at NYU or at other universities. A base minimum of 32  points of credits must be completed at the Department of Mathematics.  Information on potential transfer of credit is contained in the  forthcoming section on GSAS and Departmental Policies and Procedures.    The Written Comprehensive  Examination    The examination tests the basic knowledge required for any serious  mathematical study. It consists of the three following sections:  Advanced Calculus, Complex Variables, and Linear Algebra. The  examination is given on two consecutive days, twice a year, in early  September and early January. Each section is allotted three hours and  is written at the level of a good undergraduate course. Samples of  previous examinations are available in the departmental office.  Cooperative preparation is encouraged, as it is for all examinations.  In the fall term, the Department offers a workshop, taught by an  advanced Teaching Assistant, to help students prepare for the written  examinations.    Entering students with a solid preparation are encouraged to  consider taking the examination in their first year of full-time study.  All students must take the examinations in order to be allowed to  register for coursework beyond 36 points of credit; it is recommended  that students attempt to take the examinations well before this  deadline. Graduate Assistants are required to take the examinations  during their first year of study.    For further details, consult the section on the Written  Comprehensive Examinations .    The Oral Preliminary Examination    This examination is usually (but not invariably) taken after two  years of full-time study. The purpose of the examination is to  determine if the candidate has acquired sufficient mathematical  knowledge and maturity to commence a dissertation. The phrase  \"mathematical knowledge\" is intended to convey rather broad  acquaintance with the basic facts of mathematical life, with emphasis  on a good understanding of the simplest interesting examples. In  particular, highly technical or abstract material is inappropriate, as  is the rote reproduction of information. What the examiners look for is  something a little different and less easy to quantify. It is conveyed  in part by the word \"maturity.\" This means some idea of how mathematics  hangs together; the ability to think a little on one's feet; some  appreciation of what is natural and important, and what is artificial.  The point is that the ability to do successful research depends on more  than formal learning, and it is part of the examiners' task to assess  these less tangible aspects of the candidate's preparation.    The orals are comprised of a general section and a special section,  each lasting one hour, and are conducted by two different panels of  three faculty members. The examination takes place three times a year:  fall, mid-winter and late spring. Cooperative preparation of often  helpful and is encouraged. Over-preparation is a common trap and your  advisor can provide perspective on this. The general section consists  of five topics, one of which may be chosen freely. The other four  topics are determined by field of interest, but often turn out to be  standard: complex variables, real variables, ordinary differential  equations, and partial differential equations. Here, the level of  knowledge that is expected is equivalent to that of a one or two term  course of the kind Courant normally presents. A brochure containing the  most common questions on the general oral examination, edited by  Courant students, is available at the Department Office.    The special section is usually devoted to a single topic at a more  advanced level and extent of knowledge. The precise content is  negotiated with he candidate's faculty advisor. Normally, the chosen  topic will have a direct bearing on the candidate's Ph.D. dissertation.    All students must take the oral examinations in order to be allowed  to register for coursework beyond 60 points of credit. It is  recommended that students attempt the examinations well before this  deadline.    The Dissertation Defense    The oral defense is the final examination on the student's  dissertation. The defense is conducted by a panel of five faculty  members (including the student's advisor) and generally lasts one to  two hours. The candidate presents his/her work to a mixed audience,  some expert in the student's topic, some not. Often, this presentation  is followed by a question-and-answer period and mutual discussion of  related material and directions for future work.    Summer Internships and Employment    The Department encourages Ph.D. students at any stage of their  studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment  opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the  past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the  National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Woods  Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly  expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them  possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their  career options. The Director of Graduate Studies and members of the  faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist  students in finding appropriate summer employment.    The Ph.D. in Atmosphere Ocean Science  and Mathematics    Coursework    The curriculum for the program provides a balance between  mathematics and physical science, and aims at preparing students for  research and teaching in all aspects of applied mathematics.   Please refer to the Center for  Atmosphere Ocean Science Graduate Program for further  information on coursework (including a detailed list of courses and  sample distribution of courses by term), degree examinations and other  aspects of the program.    The Ph.D in   Computational Biology    NYU now offers a Ph.D. program in Computational Biology.  Students can apply through one of the following departments:  Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry, and the Center for  Neural Sciences. For further information about the program, click here      Visiting Doctoral Students    Advanced doctoral students at other universities who wish to spend a  term at the Courant Institute's Department of Mathematics need to  provide the following documentation:      - a letter from the student's advisor requesting that the  student spend at term at the Courant Institute to conduct  research under the supervision of a faculty mentor;      - confirmation from the Courant Institute faculty in question  that he or she are willing to work with the visiting student;        - official documentation showing financial support of at least  $2,000 U.S. per month for the term of stay.       These students will have to submit an application for non-degree  studies to NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science for the semeter  for their proposed visit. The application can be  downloaded from the Graduate Admission web page at  http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication, and sent in with  all transcripts, a statement of purpose and the application fee (GRE  tests or letters of recommendation are not required for non-degree  applications).       With this documentation, New York University will be able to sponsor  a J-1 visa for a visiting student.
