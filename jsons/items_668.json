The courses utilize conversation and song, and aim to promote   fluency in spoken Irish as well as proficiency in reading and writing.   Students progress to conversation, translations, compositions, and readings   from contemporary Irish literature. They also participate in Irish-speaking   events at Glucksman Ireland House. The Irish language fulfills NYU's    Morse   Academic Plan language requirement .       Elementary Irish I       IRISH-UA 0100 Identical to EURO-UA 0100. Open to students with no   previous training in Irish. 4 points.    This course introduces students to the rudiments of the Irish language,   including phonemes and pronunciation, syntactical structure, and verbal   conjugations. In addition, a history of the language is provided, as well   as a general introduction to Irish culture, including discussions of family   and place names. Students are encouraged to begin speaking with basic   sentence structures.       Elementary Irish II       IRISH-UA 0101 Identical to EURO-UA 0101. Continuation of IRSH-UA   0100 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    This course builds on the grammatical lessons of Elementary Irish I and   expands into more complex verbal conjugations while concentrating on   idiomatic expressions. The accumulation of vocabulary is stressed and   students are introduced to basic literature in Irish while developing   beginning conversational fluency.       Intermediate Irish I       IRISH-UA 0102 Identical to EURO-UA 0102. Prerequisite: IRSH-UA   0101 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    For the more advanced student of Irish, this course focuses on improving   conversational fluency and on expanding vocabulary through reading more   complex literature in Irish.       Intermediate Irish II       IRISH-UA 0103 Identical to EURO-UA 0103. Continuation of IRSH-UA   0102 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    The focus of this course is on conversational fluency, strengthening   students pronunciation and command of the language. This will be supported   by reading novellas suitable for adult learners, songs, poetry, folklore   and group activities.       Introduction to Celtic Music       IRISH-UA 0152 Identical to MUSIC-UA 0151. 4 points.    This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the traditional and   contemporary music of the Celtic areas of Western Europe\u2014Ireland, Scotland,   Wales, Brittany, and Galicia. Recordings and live performances present the   extraordinary range of singing styles and the musical instruments employed   in each culture, including harps, bagpipes and a variety of other wind,   free reed, keyboard and stringed instruments. Forms and musical styles are   explored in depth along with a study of their origin, evolution, and   cultural links.       Global Diaspora the Irish Case       IRISH-UA 170.001    The Irish have exemplified global patterns of migration over centuries.   This course aims at a systematic exploration of the dispersal of Irish   people around the world, focusing on their interaction with the various   host cultures they have encountered both as settlers and in other roles.   Particular attention will be given to the movements of Irish on the   European continent and in Britain, the United States and Canada, the   Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand and South America. We will study   the consequences of emigration for Ireland and for the receiving nations,   as well as Ireland's transformation in the late twentieth century from   emigrant nursery to an emigrant destination. Starting with a chronological   focus, the class them moves to a more geographic concentration on some of   the most prominent Irish diasporic communities. As well as drawing on the   literature extant in the field, this class will make use of oral histories,   film and audio sources to explore the relevant themes and topics.       The Irish &amp; New York       IRISH-UA 0180 Identical to HIST-UA 0180 and METRO-UA 0325. 4   points.    This course considers the symbiotic relationship between a developing   metropolis and an immigrant people since the 18th century, with a special   concentration on significant mid-19th century political, social and   cultural changes when New York City was dramatically altered by the   Irish. The ultimate goal of this course is to learn to think   critically about the past. Students will (1) explore how certain   themes and events are used to define and mythologize the urban and ethnic,   and (2) consider the factors beyond race and language which help define and   preserve ethnic group identity over time. Student projects in new   media will be encouraged.       Topics in Irish History       IRISH-UA 0181 Identical to HIST-UA 0181. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow   flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in   particular fields. Past examinations have included imagery and ideology of   Irish nationalism, Irish American popular folk culture, and the Irish in   America.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 181.001 - Ireland and   America since 1920    This course examines the history of Ireland (including Northern Ireland),   the United States, and significantly Irish America, as they intersect or   diverge over the course of the twentieth century. When Northern   Ireland was created in 1920 and the Irish Free State in 1922, there were   2.3 million Irish-born living in America, nearly half the population of the   entire island. A new phase in Irish-American relations began during   which diplomacy, economics, education, immigration, nationalism, tourism,   culture, philanthropy and the circulatory movement of capital emerged as   major arenas for interaction. Through readings, films, oral history   and discussions that highlight the comparative element of this course,   students will examine key themes that connect Ireland and the United States   in this period as well as interrogating an emerging historiography.       Section 2 - IRISH-UA 181.002 -   Global History of Irish-Speaking Ireland, 1500-Present    Irish (or Gaelic), the language spoken by a majority of the Irish people up   until the beginning of the nineteenth century, has played a major role in   the history of Ireland and its wider global diaspora. The medium of one of   the earliest vernacular literatures in Europe, the subsequent decline in   the number of its speakers prompted a move to restore it as part of the   creation of an independent Ireland. This course will trace the history of   the Irish-speaking community, starting with samples (in English   translation) of early modern prose and poetry, and followed by a look at   the fortunes of the Irish-speaking community in the nineteen century in   Ireland, North America, and Australia. Finally, the last third of the   course will take up the subject of its revival, the status of Irish in a   fully independent state, and the politics of language in Northern   Ireland.       History of Modern Ireland, 1580-1800       IRISH-UA 0182 Identical to HIST-UA 0182. 4 points.    Examines the English conquest of Ireland from the reign of Elizabeth I to   the last meeting of the Irish Parliament. Key themes include the plantation   of Ireland with settlers from England, Scotland, and Wales, the decline of   the Gaelic political order and culture, the religious reformation and   Counter Reformation, Ireland as a site of English and European wars, the   imposition of a penal code, and the vain attempt to rebel against British   rule in the late 18th century resulting in the Act of Union, which   disestablished the Irish Parliament in Dublin.       History of Modern Ireland, 1800 to the present       IRISH-UA 0183 Identical to HIST-UA 0183. 4 points.    This class explores topics of conquest, collaboration, assimilation,   resistance and migration through the prism of the Ireland, in the years   since 1800. Particular attention is paid to the complex geopolitical   relationship that has existed between Ireland and her nearest neighbor,   Britain. The Act of Union is located in the context of a panoramic survey   of the condition of Ireland on the eve of incorporation into the United   Kingdom. We look at the place of the historical memory in fashioning   inherited identities shaped most explicitly by nationalism. The Irish   diaspora is another important part of this course and is a theme that spans   the centuries. We excavate the complex links between culture, language,   politics and identity, and expressed in a variety of movements in Ireland   and abroad. By starting with the emergence of nationalism in the nineteenth   century we can gain an understanding of the political impulses that shaped   twentieth-century Irish history. In the aftermath of revolution, a bitter   civil war and partition, the island saw two state-building projects emerge   catering to the needs of two jurisdictions divided along political,   cultural and economic priorities. We plot out the most significant aspects   of the division that has characterized the history and shed light on the   dynamic of Ireland's more recent history.       Seminar in Irish History       IRISH-UA 185 4 points.    Intensive examination of specific areas of Irish history with an emphasis   on critical reading and individual research projects. Past themes include   the development and modernization of the Republic of Ireland with   particular consideration of the economy; the Great Famine of 1845-1851,   which was an immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people but   which was also the catalyst for substantial changes - positive and negative   - in Irish society and culture; and the cinematic representations of Irish   Americans.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 185.001 -   The Largest Irish City in the World: New York City, 1880: A Geographical   and Statistical Analysis    In the year 1880, following over a century of robust migration links   between Ireland and the eastern seaboard of the U.S., three-quarters of a   million residents of New York City could claim Irish ancestry, with a third   of these first-generation immigrants. It is this population that will serve   as the basis for a semester-long research investigation of the demographic,   social, and cultural dynamics variables of these residents as revealed in   the 1880 U.S. census. The course will be built around student acquisition,   via labs, of a set of analytical techniques, including statistical   sampling, demographic data analysis, and database construction, as well as   student application of ArcGIS and stats software. Among the digital and   statistical skills imparted in this class will be understanding demographic   dataset structures and design, learning approaches to regularizing and   \u201ccleaning\u201d rough data for effective analysis, user training in IPUMS-USA   data resources, and use of ArcGIS to organize and manage geographically   variant historic data within an urban setting using georeferencing. In   addition, the course will impart firm historical knowledge of the time   period with readings and discussion on the material culture, social   characteristics, and living conditions of Irish populations in nineteenth   century New York and Ireland.  Section   2  - IRISH-UA 185.002 - Sport and Empire   since 1800    The impact of empires, above all the British, after about 1800,   transformed the role of organized sport over much of the globe. But   there were wide variations in the responses of both indigenous and settler   cultures to the opportunities offered, and the challenges, or even threats,   to indigenous identities, posed by the spread of sporting   activity. A host of questions arise, requiring analysis of the   ideological, military, political, religious, social and cultural factors   influencing the wide variety of responses. How closely are sporting   identities/cultures woven into the texture of the national   identities/cultures of their countries? How close is the connection between   sporting identity and other identities like race, class and gender,   themselves also undergoing processes of change. We will also explore   the decline of the major European empires on sporting and   cultural identities at global level.      Section 3 - IRISH-UA 185.003 -   Media, Discourse, and Irish America    This course will explore the ways in which a specific immigrant group has   been portrayed in various media over two centuries, with a particular   emphasis on the visual construction of ethnicity in mediums like film and   advertising. It will concentrate on the images that have been used to   characterize the Irish who live in the United States, analyze the roots of   that imagery, consider the implications of ethnic representation for   Ireland and its American diaspora, as well as the impact of popular culture   on identity formation. Section 4   - IRISH-UA 185.004 - Resurrecting the Ethnic Village: Research   Methods on Irish New York    One of the hallmarks of New York City is ethnic succession which, by its   very nature, renders the past invisible in the modern city. This   course focuses on the mid-nineteenth century when immigration from Ireland   dramatically altered New York politically, socially and culturally.   Students will study an Irish neighborhood in lower Manhattan using   traditional and modern methods of historical research. They will work   alone and in groups on a project which involves the collection of textual,   numeric, and visual data, including fieldwork in Chinatown. They will   acquire basic skills in data management, analysis, and presentation through   hands-on lab work with spreadsheets, Google Products, and   geographic/spatial programs.        The Irish in America       IRISH-UA 0187 Indentical to HIST-UA 0187. 4 points.     From the seventeenth century to the present, Irish people   have been crossing the Atlantic to North America. They are one of the most   significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States.   Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only   partially explains our contemporary understanding of \"Irish America.\"   Ethnicity is an imprint and defining feature of American life yet the Irish   experience with it over the past four centuries is a story complicated by   multiple generations, diversity of class, continuing immigration, and rapid   changes in both the homeland and the receiving country. This course will   consider the factors affecting emigration from Ireland; examine the impact   of the Irish on the development of the United States since the colonial   period, particularly on its cities; study the changing Irish image in   American popular culture; and consider what the Irish can teach us about   the evolution of ethnic identity. The ultimate goal of this course is to   learn to think historically.       Oral History of Irish America       IRISH-UA 203. 4 points.    The Oral History of Irish America seminar is a unique undergraduate   experience that offers students a small class size (typically no more than   8 students), an interdisciplinary approach to oral history that introduces   students to the methodology, its significance as a resource, its role in   historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the   opportunity to create an original public history document that will be   deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by   researchers. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen   from the Irish American community in New York City. The seminar provides an   opportunity to meet and work with dynamic, involved citizens from all walks   of life. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an   Oscar and Pulitzer prize-winning playwright and director, as well as   actors, musicians, teachers and Wall Street executives, among many   others. In addition to interviewing this person, the student will   produce a package that includes a biography, interview finding guide, and   content for a website. Part of the background research for the   project will be drawn from classroom lectures and readings adapted to   illuminate the life histories of the interview subjects chosen for the   semester to help students place their subjects in context, in addition to   students' independent research efforts. Students should be aware that   the final project requires extensive editing and rewriting because it will   be deposited in the Archives and published on the Glucksman Ireland House   Oral History website. The seminar offers real-world skills applicable   to many career paths, as well as a publication that can be cited on a   student's CV.       For examples of previous student work see:    http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/aia/collections/ihoral/oral01.htm .   For more information about the course on Oral History of Irish America,   please see our special Oral History   Project page .       Cinematic Representations of Irish   Americans       IRISH-UA 204. 4 points.     The visual image is central to the history of the   twentieth century. This course will explore the ways in which a   specific immigrant group has been portrayed in the media, especially in   feature films from the silent era to the present. It will concentrate   on the variety of images that have been used to characterize the Irish who   live in the United States, analyze the roots of that imagery and the   implications of cinematic representation for Irish American   history. Students will learn how to \"read\" American cinema as   documentary evidence of the visual construction of ethnicity. Through   writing assignments that group films, students will apply increasing   degrees of analysis to thematic, comparative, and chronological changes in   representation during the twentieth century. The skills acquired in   this seminar should translate into a heightened awareness of the   relationship between ethnicity and all forms of media in contemporary   American popular culture.       Contemporary Irish Politics and Society       IRISH-UA 0515 Identical to EURO-UA 0515. 4 points.     An examination of the politics of contemporary Ireland,   north and south. The course focuses on political, governmental, and   constitutional developments in the Republic of Ireland since independence   and discusses the causes of conflict and the prospect of resolution in   Northern Ireland.          The Irish Renaissance       IRISH-UA 0621 Identical to ENGL-UA 0621. 4 points.    This course seeks to understand the extraordinary achievements of Irish   writers in the last decade of the 19th and the first third of the 20th   century. We will read widely in all the different genres \u2014 poetry,   polemic, short story, novel, drama \u2014 that were remade by Irish writers   during the tumultuous period from the fall of Charles Stuart Parnell into   the early years of national government in the 1930s. Authors read on   the course include Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, George   Bernard Shaw, Lady Augusta Gregory, John Synge, Sean O'Casey, Elizabeth   Bowen, Flann O'Brien and others. We will balance our readings of   literature with consideration of the social and historical contexts of   Ireland under the Union with Britain, and after that Union was partially   broken. In attempting to refine the proper lens through which to view   this literature, we will address a number of salient issues, including the   nature and cultural forms of Irish cultural nationalism, the violence of   civil war, the social position of literature and of intellectuals in   projects of national reconciliation and national identity, and the clash   between revolutionary anti-imperialism and conservative Catholicism,   between rural and urban identities, between provincialism and   cosmopolitanism as strategies for literary self-fashioning.       Irish American Literature       IRISH-UA 0622 Identical to ENGL-UA 0622. 4 points.    The course examines Irish American literature from the 19th century to the   present, considering the literary responses of generations of Irish   immigrants as they strove to understand and contribute to the American   experience. The works of writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eugene   O'Neill, Flannery O'Connor, John O'Hara, and William Kennedy are explored,   as are the connections between ethnic and literary cultures.       Colloquium: James Joyce       IRISH-UA 0625 Identical to ENGL-UA 0625. 4 points.    This course is an in-depth consideration of all of the major works of James   Joyce, from the early short stories of Dubliners to the late   experimental prose/poetry of Finnegan's Wake ; it concentrates,   however, on a detailed and systematic reading of Ulysses .    The biographical and social/historical contexts of Joyce's work are   investigated alongside consideration of his pathbreaking formal experiments   and his relations with the many currents of literary and artistic   Modernism. Discussion of Ulysses is complimented by consideration of   the many forms of literary and critical theory that have been fashioned   around readings of the book.       Irish Dramatists       IRISH-UA 0700 Identical to DRAMA-UA 0603, DRALIT-UA 0700, and   ENGL-UA 0700. 4 points.    A study of the rich dramatic tradition of Ireland since the days of William   Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, and the fledgling Abbey Theatre. Playwrights   covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett,   Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin.   Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged   alongside an appreciation of the emotional texture, poetic achievements,   and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic   work.       Topics in Irish Literature       IRISH-UA 761 Identical to ENGL-UA 761. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow   flexibility in course offerings by Ireland House faculty and by visiting   scholars.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 761.001 - Visualizing Modern Ireland: Art and Literature in the   20th Century       Ireland has a reputation as a small nation with an outsized literary   heritage. Far less often do we think of Irish artists on an international   scale. Nonetheless, the country had a vibrant visual arts culture   throughout the twentieth-century. Did Irish artists and Irish writers   working at the same time perceive their nation and their world in the same   way? How did culture and politics shape literary and artistic movements in   Ireland? This course will attempt to answer these questions through an   exploration of the concurrent and overlapping literary and visual arts   movements in Ireland from approximately 1900 through the 1980s.                 Section 2 - IRISH-UA 761.002 -   Modernism, Translation &amp; Feminism: Irish Poetry 1893-2000    This course will introduce students to the most significant poets in Irish   from the establishment of the Gaelic League in 1893 to the end of the   twentieth century through a close reading of a selection of their poems   with English translations. The politics and practice of translation from a   minority to a majority language will be discussed as well as local Irish   adaptations to international ideas and influences such as modernism and   feminism. The course will also consider the historical context in which   individual poets emerged and the critical debates that shaped both the   writing itself and the readerly response to their work. The course will be   taught by eminent visiting professor Dr. Louis De Paor of National   University of Ireland - Galway. Dr. Louis de Paor, Director of the   Centre for Irish Studies at the National University of Ireland, Galway is a   multi-award winner of the Oireachtas literary competitions and holds his   PhD in Modern Irish from the National University of Ireland. A well-known   poet that works within the Irish language, De Paor's poetry collections   include &lt;em&gt;Pr\u00f3ca solais is luatha&lt;/em&gt;, (1988), &lt;em&gt;30   d\u00e1n&lt;/em&gt; (1992) and his most recent collection titled &lt;em&gt;Agus   Rud Eile De/ And Another Thing&lt;/em&gt; (2010). Dr. de Paor is   currently Senior Irish Language Fulbright Scholar as New York University   for the Fall 2013 semester.       Section 3 - IRISH-UA 761.003 -   Globalization and Irish Drama    This class on Irish drama will examine the many ways that Irish playwrights   have reached out to the world and the ways the world has staged the works   of Irish playwrights. With increased opportunities for theatrical   productions to travel internationally, dramatists of the past 25 years have   sought new strategies for adapting their work to a global   marketplace. We will journey with familiar plays as they are   performed on a world stage (Lady Gregory in Australia, Beckett in Sarajevo)   and will consider how contemporary playwrights have reflected on cultural   tensions within Ireland: debates about multiculturalism, the   influence of new media, and the social impact of the current global   financial crisis. What performance strategies are embedded in the   mobility of exiles and \u00e9migr\u00e9s? What becomes of a national theater in   a transnational world? How are actors trained in Ireland today, and   how does the Irish accent sound as it projects across borders? In   addition to canonical and contemporary plays, we will watch the   high-stepping spectacle of Riverdance and see Ireland get ready for its   close-up in Hollywood. This course aims to give students a chance to engage   with a wide range of current literary and cultural debates concerning   cosmopolitanism, trans-nationalism, localism, and world form, and to ask   how contesting definitions and dramatizations of each term have conditioned   Ireland\u2019s entry into our era of high globalization. Working on   individual research projects \u2013 which we will address collaboratively in the   classroom \u2013 students will use and create digital archives of the   production/reception of Irish works of art on other continents. We   will study plays by authors such as Dion Boucicault, J.M. Synge, Samuel   Beckett, Brian Friel, Marie Jones, Seamus Heaney, Martin McDonagh, Marina   Carr, Bisi Adigun, Roddy Doyle and others.             Topics in Irish Literary, Visual, &amp;   Performing Arts:    Irish Dance Performance: Tradition, Modernity, and Innovation - What   We Think of That JIG We Do       IRISH-UA 902. 4 points.    Over the course of the last two decades, Irish Dance has changed enormously   and irreversibly. From the exclusive world of competition governed by the   auspices of An Coimisium le Rinci Gaelacha (the Irish Dancing Commission)   to the advent of the spectacle shows in the Mid-90's and beyond, a dynamic   shift in the global perception of the form has consequently challenged   notions of authenticity, tradition, and modernity. Throughout this course,   we shall develop a basic knowledge of the history and lexicon of Irish   Dance, and will use that as a departure point for broader theoretical   considerations.        We will look at traditional form,   stylistic variations and the peripheral influences that shape them. The   course will also examine choreographic innovation, theatrical settings, and   artistic visions of seminal works ranging from the popular, such as    Riverdance, Lord of the Dance and Dancing   on Dangerous Ground , to the contemporary expressions of solo   practitioners.           The course aim is to stimulate a process   of reading expressive form by examining varying aesthetics through critical   thinking, and to contextualize the multifaceted influences that continue to   shape our perception of Irish Dance Performance.         Jean Butler has won numerous awards at   regional, national, and world competitions in Irish Dance over her 30 year   career. She was co-choreographer and principal female lead in the   original production of Riverdance ,   and has gone onto a successful solo career as dancer, choreographer, and   artist-in-residence with musical groups (including The Chieftains),   Ireland's National Theater The Abbey, the World Academy of Music and Dance   at the University of Limerick and New York's Danspace   Project.       Independent Study       IRISH-UA 0998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate   studies is required. 2 or 4 points per term.    Independent study with an Irish studies faculty member.       NYU in Dublin       The focus of NYU's summer program in Dublin is contemporary Ireland and   its culture. The program is centered at Trinity College, Ireland's oldest   university, situated in the heart of Dublin, where students reside and take   classes. Courses are open to NYU and non-NYU students, both graduate and   undergraduate, and include Irish literature, history, politics, visual and   performing arts, creative writing, popular culture and the Irish language.   The academic program is complemented by a series of field trips and   cultural and social activities designed to broaden students' knowledge of   Ireland. Among the typical evening activities are outings to the theatre,   poetry readings, screenings at the new Irish Film Center, and traditional   music sessions. Weekend excursions include Donegal and Galway. See our   visit the NYU's Summer   Study Abroad: Summer in Dublin page for more information about   available courses and its application process.                         Freshman Seminar: What Are They Talking   About?: Oral History in the 21st Century       FRSEM-UA 482.001 4   points. Long before the technology of today's social media,   cultures, families and individuals shared their personal and community   stories in an oral tradition that preserved the past for future   generations. We will examine the discipline and evolution of oral history   using the Oral History Collection of Glucksman Ireland House to explore how   and why oral histories contribute to our understanding of the past and can   help to shape the identity of individuals and communities.       This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an   interdisciplinary approach to the methodology of oral history, its   significance as a resource, its role in historical research, as well as   specific interviewing and research techniques. Students will gain access to   our Archive of Irish America and have the opportunity to work with the   interviews we have already deposited, including how the university's   digital mapping technology can applied in our analysis of the   archive. Students will also have the chance to conduct an interview   themselves. The course comprises classroom lectures, readings, and   extensive writing exercises; it offers real world experience and   communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout   students' academic and professional careers.                                          &Aacute;ras Glucksman na h&Eacute;ireann                      Ollscoil Nua Eabhrac                  Glucksman Ireland House                  New York University                  One Washington Mews                  New York, NY 10003                  U.S.A.

The courses utilize conversation and song, and aim to promote   fluency in spoken Irish as well as proficiency in reading and writing.   Students progress to conversation, translations, compositions, and readings   from contemporary Irish literature. They also participate in Irish-speaking   events at Glucksman Ireland House. The Irish language fulfills NYU's    Morse   Academic Plan language requirement .       Elementary Irish I       IRISH-UA 0100 Identical to EURO-UA 0100. Open to students with no   previous training in Irish. 4 points.    This course introduces students to the rudiments of the Irish language,   including phonemes and pronunciation, syntactical structure, and verbal   conjugations. In addition, a history of the language is provided, as well   as a general introduction to Irish culture, including discussions of family   and place names. Students are encouraged to begin speaking with basic   sentence structures.       Elementary Irish II       IRISH-UA 0101 Identical to EURO-UA 0101. Continuation of IRSH-UA   0100 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    This course builds on the grammatical lessons of Elementary Irish I and   expands into more complex verbal conjugations while concentrating on   idiomatic expressions. The accumulation of vocabulary is stressed and   students are introduced to basic literature in Irish while developing   beginning conversational fluency.       Intermediate Irish I       IRISH-UA 0102 Identical to EURO-UA 0102. Prerequisite: IRSH-UA   0101 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    For the more advanced student of Irish, this course focuses on improving   conversational fluency and on expanding vocabulary through reading more   complex literature in Irish.       Intermediate Irish II       IRISH-UA 0103 Identical to EURO-UA 0103. Continuation of IRSH-UA   0102 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    The focus of this course is on conversational fluency, strengthening   students pronunciation and command of the language. This will be supported   by reading novellas suitable for adult learners, songs, poetry, folklore   and group activities.       Introduction to Celtic Music       IRISH-UA 0152 Identical to MUSIC-UA 0151. 4 points.    This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the traditional and   contemporary music of the Celtic areas of Western Europe\u2014Ireland, Scotland,   Wales, Brittany, and Galicia. Recordings and live performances present the   extraordinary range of singing styles and the musical instruments employed   in each culture, including harps, bagpipes and a variety of other wind,   free reed, keyboard and stringed instruments. Forms and musical styles are   explored in depth along with a study of their origin, evolution, and   cultural links.       Global Diaspora the Irish Case       IRISH-UA 170.001    The Irish have exemplified global patterns of migration over centuries.   This course aims at a systematic exploration of the dispersal of Irish   people around the world, focusing on their interaction with the various   host cultures they have encountered both as settlers and in other roles.   Particular attention will be given to the movements of Irish on the   European continent and in Britain, the United States and Canada, the   Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand and South America. We will study   the consequences of emigration for Ireland and for the receiving nations,   as well as Ireland's transformation in the late twentieth century from   emigrant nursery to an emigrant destination. Starting with a chronological   focus, the class them moves to a more geographic concentration on some of   the most prominent Irish diasporic communities. As well as drawing on the   literature extant in the field, this class will make use of oral histories,   film and audio sources to explore the relevant themes and topics.       The Irish &amp; New York       IRISH-UA 0180 Identical to HIST-UA 0180 and METRO-UA 0325. 4   points.    This course considers the symbiotic relationship between a developing   metropolis and an immigrant people since the 18th century, with a special   concentration on significant mid-19th century political, social and   cultural changes when New York City was dramatically altered by the   Irish. The ultimate goal of this course is to learn to think   critically about the past. Students will (1) explore how certain   themes and events are used to define and mythologize the urban and ethnic,   and (2) consider the factors beyond race and language which help define and   preserve ethnic group identity over time. Student projects in new   media will be encouraged.       Topics in Irish History       IRISH-UA 0181 Identical to HIST-UA 0181. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow   flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in   particular fields. Past examinations have included imagery and ideology of   Irish nationalism, Irish American popular folk culture, and the Irish in   America.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 181.001 - Ireland and   America since 1920    This course examines the history of Ireland (including Northern Ireland),   the United States, and significantly Irish America, as they intersect or   diverge over the course of the twentieth century. When Northern   Ireland was created in 1920 and the Irish Free State in 1922, there were   2.3 million Irish-born living in America, nearly half the population of the   entire island. A new phase in Irish-American relations began during   which diplomacy, economics, education, immigration, nationalism, tourism,   culture, philanthropy and the circulatory movement of capital emerged as   major arenas for interaction. Through readings, films, oral history   and discussions that highlight the comparative element of this course,   students will examine key themes that connect Ireland and the United States   in this period as well as interrogating an emerging historiography.       Section 2 - IRISH-UA 181.002 -   Global History of Irish-Speaking Ireland, 1500-Present    Irish (or Gaelic), the language spoken by a majority of the Irish people up   until the beginning of the nineteenth century, has played a major role in   the history of Ireland and its wider global diaspora. The medium of one of   the earliest vernacular literatures in Europe, the subsequent decline in   the number of its speakers prompted a move to restore it as part of the   creation of an independent Ireland. This course will trace the history of   the Irish-speaking community, starting with samples (in English   translation) of early modern prose and poetry, and followed by a look at   the fortunes of the Irish-speaking community in the nineteen century in   Ireland, North America, and Australia. Finally, the last third of the   course will take up the subject of its revival, the status of Irish in a   fully independent state, and the politics of language in Northern   Ireland.       History of Modern Ireland, 1580-1800       IRISH-UA 0182 Identical to HIST-UA 0182. 4 points.    Examines the English conquest of Ireland from the reign of Elizabeth I to   the last meeting of the Irish Parliament. Key themes include the plantation   of Ireland with settlers from England, Scotland, and Wales, the decline of   the Gaelic political order and culture, the religious reformation and   Counter Reformation, Ireland as a site of English and European wars, the   imposition of a penal code, and the vain attempt to rebel against British   rule in the late 18th century resulting in the Act of Union, which   disestablished the Irish Parliament in Dublin.       History of Modern Ireland, 1800 to the present       IRISH-UA 0183 Identical to HIST-UA 0183. 4 points.    This class explores topics of conquest, collaboration, assimilation,   resistance and migration through the prism of the Ireland, in the years   since 1800. Particular attention is paid to the complex geopolitical   relationship that has existed between Ireland and her nearest neighbor,   Britain. The Act of Union is located in the context of a panoramic survey   of the condition of Ireland on the eve of incorporation into the United   Kingdom. We look at the place of the historical memory in fashioning   inherited identities shaped most explicitly by nationalism. The Irish   diaspora is another important part of this course and is a theme that spans   the centuries. We excavate the complex links between culture, language,   politics and identity, and expressed in a variety of movements in Ireland   and abroad. By starting with the emergence of nationalism in the nineteenth   century we can gain an understanding of the political impulses that shaped   twentieth-century Irish history. In the aftermath of revolution, a bitter   civil war and partition, the island saw two state-building projects emerge   catering to the needs of two jurisdictions divided along political,   cultural and economic priorities. We plot out the most significant aspects   of the division that has characterized the history and shed light on the   dynamic of Ireland's more recent history.       Seminar in Irish History       IRISH-UA 185 4 points.    Intensive examination of specific areas of Irish history with an emphasis   on critical reading and individual research projects. Past themes include   the development and modernization of the Republic of Ireland with   particular consideration of the economy; the Great Famine of 1845-1851,   which was an immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people but   which was also the catalyst for substantial changes - positive and negative   - in Irish society and culture; and the cinematic representations of Irish   Americans.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 185.001 -   The Largest Irish City in the World: New York City, 1880: A Geographical   and Statistical Analysis    In the year 1880, following over a century of robust migration links   between Ireland and the eastern seaboard of the U.S., three-quarters of a   million residents of New York City could claim Irish ancestry, with a third   of these first-generation immigrants. It is this population that will serve   as the basis for a semester-long research investigation of the demographic,   social, and cultural dynamics variables of these residents as revealed in   the 1880 U.S. census. The course will be built around student acquisition,   via labs, of a set of analytical techniques, including statistical   sampling, demographic data analysis, and database construction, as well as   student application of ArcGIS and stats software. Among the digital and   statistical skills imparted in this class will be understanding demographic   dataset structures and design, learning approaches to regularizing and   \u201ccleaning\u201d rough data for effective analysis, user training in IPUMS-USA   data resources, and use of ArcGIS to organize and manage geographically   variant historic data within an urban setting using georeferencing. In   addition, the course will impart firm historical knowledge of the time   period with readings and discussion on the material culture, social   characteristics, and living conditions of Irish populations in nineteenth   century New York and Ireland.  Section   2  - IRISH-UA 185.002 - Sport and Empire   since 1800    The impact of empires, above all the British, after about 1800,   transformed the role of organized sport over much of the globe. But   there were wide variations in the responses of both indigenous and settler   cultures to the opportunities offered, and the challenges, or even threats,   to indigenous identities, posed by the spread of sporting   activity. A host of questions arise, requiring analysis of the   ideological, military, political, religious, social and cultural factors   influencing the wide variety of responses. How closely are sporting   identities/cultures woven into the texture of the national   identities/cultures of their countries? How close is the connection between   sporting identity and other identities like race, class and gender,   themselves also undergoing processes of change. We will also explore   the decline of the major European empires on sporting and   cultural identities at global level.      Section 3 - IRISH-UA 185.003 -   Media, Discourse, and Irish America    This course will explore the ways in which a specific immigrant group has   been portrayed in various media over two centuries, with a particular   emphasis on the visual construction of ethnicity in mediums like film and   advertising. It will concentrate on the images that have been used to   characterize the Irish who live in the United States, analyze the roots of   that imagery, consider the implications of ethnic representation for   Ireland and its American diaspora, as well as the impact of popular culture   on identity formation. Section 4   - IRISH-UA 185.004 - Resurrecting the Ethnic Village: Research   Methods on Irish New York    One of the hallmarks of New York City is ethnic succession which, by its   very nature, renders the past invisible in the modern city. This   course focuses on the mid-nineteenth century when immigration from Ireland   dramatically altered New York politically, socially and culturally.   Students will study an Irish neighborhood in lower Manhattan using   traditional and modern methods of historical research. They will work   alone and in groups on a project which involves the collection of textual,   numeric, and visual data, including fieldwork in Chinatown. They will   acquire basic skills in data management, analysis, and presentation through   hands-on lab work with spreadsheets, Google Products, and   geographic/spatial programs.        The Irish in America       IRISH-UA 0187 Indentical to HIST-UA 0187. 4 points.     From the seventeenth century to the present, Irish people   have been crossing the Atlantic to North America. They are one of the most   significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States.   Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only   partially explains our contemporary understanding of \"Irish America.\"   Ethnicity is an imprint and defining feature of American life yet the Irish   experience with it over the past four centuries is a story complicated by   multiple generations, diversity of class, continuing immigration, and rapid   changes in both the homeland and the receiving country. This course will   consider the factors affecting emigration from Ireland; examine the impact   of the Irish on the development of the United States since the colonial   period, particularly on its cities; study the changing Irish image in   American popular culture; and consider what the Irish can teach us about   the evolution of ethnic identity. The ultimate goal of this course is to   learn to think historically.       Oral History of Irish America       IRISH-UA 203. 4 points.    The Oral History of Irish America seminar is a unique undergraduate   experience that offers students a small class size (typically no more than   8 students), an interdisciplinary approach to oral history that introduces   students to the methodology, its significance as a resource, its role in   historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the   opportunity to create an original public history document that will be   deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by   researchers. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen   from the Irish American community in New York City. The seminar provides an   opportunity to meet and work with dynamic, involved citizens from all walks   of life. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an   Oscar and Pulitzer prize-winning playwright and director, as well as   actors, musicians, teachers and Wall Street executives, among many   others. In addition to interviewing this person, the student will   produce a package that includes a biography, interview finding guide, and   content for a website. Part of the background research for the   project will be drawn from classroom lectures and readings adapted to   illuminate the life histories of the interview subjects chosen for the   semester to help students place their subjects in context, in addition to   students' independent research efforts. Students should be aware that   the final project requires extensive editing and rewriting because it will   be deposited in the Archives and published on the Glucksman Ireland House   Oral History website. The seminar offers real-world skills applicable   to many career paths, as well as a publication that can be cited on a   student's CV.       For examples of previous student work see:    http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/aia/collections/ihoral/oral01.htm .   For more information about the course on Oral History of Irish America,   please see our special Oral History   Project page .       Cinematic Representations of Irish   Americans       IRISH-UA 204. 4 points.     The visual image is central to the history of the   twentieth century. This course will explore the ways in which a   specific immigrant group has been portrayed in the media, especially in   feature films from the silent era to the present. It will concentrate   on the variety of images that have been used to characterize the Irish who   live in the United States, analyze the roots of that imagery and the   implications of cinematic representation for Irish American   history. Students will learn how to \"read\" American cinema as   documentary evidence of the visual construction of ethnicity. Through   writing assignments that group films, students will apply increasing   degrees of analysis to thematic, comparative, and chronological changes in   representation during the twentieth century. The skills acquired in   this seminar should translate into a heightened awareness of the   relationship between ethnicity and all forms of media in contemporary   American popular culture.       Contemporary Irish Politics and Society       IRISH-UA 0515 Identical to EURO-UA 0515. 4 points.     An examination of the politics of contemporary Ireland,   north and south. The course focuses on political, governmental, and   constitutional developments in the Republic of Ireland since independence   and discusses the causes of conflict and the prospect of resolution in   Northern Ireland.          The Irish Renaissance       IRISH-UA 0621 Identical to ENGL-UA 0621. 4 points.    This course seeks to understand the extraordinary achievements of Irish   writers in the last decade of the 19th and the first third of the 20th   century. We will read widely in all the different genres \u2014 poetry,   polemic, short story, novel, drama \u2014 that were remade by Irish writers   during the tumultuous period from the fall of Charles Stuart Parnell into   the early years of national government in the 1930s. Authors read on   the course include Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, George   Bernard Shaw, Lady Augusta Gregory, John Synge, Sean O'Casey, Elizabeth   Bowen, Flann O'Brien and others. We will balance our readings of   literature with consideration of the social and historical contexts of   Ireland under the Union with Britain, and after that Union was partially   broken. In attempting to refine the proper lens through which to view   this literature, we will address a number of salient issues, including the   nature and cultural forms of Irish cultural nationalism, the violence of   civil war, the social position of literature and of intellectuals in   projects of national reconciliation and national identity, and the clash   between revolutionary anti-imperialism and conservative Catholicism,   between rural and urban identities, between provincialism and   cosmopolitanism as strategies for literary self-fashioning.       Irish American Literature       IRISH-UA 0622 Identical to ENGL-UA 0622. 4 points.    The course examines Irish American literature from the 19th century to the   present, considering the literary responses of generations of Irish   immigrants as they strove to understand and contribute to the American   experience. The works of writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eugene   O'Neill, Flannery O'Connor, John O'Hara, and William Kennedy are explored,   as are the connections between ethnic and literary cultures.       Colloquium: James Joyce       IRISH-UA 0625 Identical to ENGL-UA 0625. 4 points.    This course is an in-depth consideration of all of the major works of James   Joyce, from the early short stories of Dubliners to the late   experimental prose/poetry of Finnegan's Wake ; it concentrates,   however, on a detailed and systematic reading of Ulysses .    The biographical and social/historical contexts of Joyce's work are   investigated alongside consideration of his pathbreaking formal experiments   and his relations with the many currents of literary and artistic   Modernism. Discussion of Ulysses is complimented by consideration of   the many forms of literary and critical theory that have been fashioned   around readings of the book.       Irish Dramatists       IRISH-UA 0700 Identical to DRAMA-UA 0603, DRALIT-UA 0700, and   ENGL-UA 0700. 4 points.    A study of the rich dramatic tradition of Ireland since the days of William   Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, and the fledgling Abbey Theatre. Playwrights   covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett,   Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin.   Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged   alongside an appreciation of the emotional texture, poetic achievements,   and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic   work.       Topics in Irish Literature       IRISH-UA 761 Identical to ENGL-UA 761. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow   flexibility in course offerings by Ireland House faculty and by visiting   scholars.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 761.001 - Visualizing Modern Ireland: Art and Literature in the   20th Century       Ireland has a reputation as a small nation with an outsized literary   heritage. Far less often do we think of Irish artists on an international   scale. Nonetheless, the country had a vibrant visual arts culture   throughout the twentieth-century. Did Irish artists and Irish writers   working at the same time perceive their nation and their world in the same   way? How did culture and politics shape literary and artistic movements in   Ireland? This course will attempt to answer these questions through an   exploration of the concurrent and overlapping literary and visual arts   movements in Ireland from approximately 1900 through the 1980s.                 Section 2 - IRISH-UA 761.002 -   Modernism, Translation &amp; Feminism: Irish Poetry 1893-2000    This course will introduce students to the most significant poets in Irish   from the establishment of the Gaelic League in 1893 to the end of the   twentieth century through a close reading of a selection of their poems   with English translations. The politics and practice of translation from a   minority to a majority language will be discussed as well as local Irish   adaptations to international ideas and influences such as modernism and   feminism. The course will also consider the historical context in which   individual poets emerged and the critical debates that shaped both the   writing itself and the readerly response to their work. The course will be   taught by eminent visiting professor Dr. Louis De Paor of National   University of Ireland - Galway. Dr. Louis de Paor, Director of the   Centre for Irish Studies at the National University of Ireland, Galway is a   multi-award winner of the Oireachtas literary competitions and holds his   PhD in Modern Irish from the National University of Ireland. A well-known   poet that works within the Irish language, De Paor's poetry collections   include &lt;em&gt;Pr\u00f3ca solais is luatha&lt;/em&gt;, (1988), &lt;em&gt;30   d\u00e1n&lt;/em&gt; (1992) and his most recent collection titled &lt;em&gt;Agus   Rud Eile De/ And Another Thing&lt;/em&gt; (2010). Dr. de Paor is   currently Senior Irish Language Fulbright Scholar as New York University   for the Fall 2013 semester.       Section 3 - IRISH-UA 761.003 -   Globalization and Irish Drama    This class on Irish drama will examine the many ways that Irish playwrights   have reached out to the world and the ways the world has staged the works   of Irish playwrights. With increased opportunities for theatrical   productions to travel internationally, dramatists of the past 25 years have   sought new strategies for adapting their work to a global   marketplace. We will journey with familiar plays as they are   performed on a world stage (Lady Gregory in Australia, Beckett in Sarajevo)   and will consider how contemporary playwrights have reflected on cultural   tensions within Ireland: debates about multiculturalism, the   influence of new media, and the social impact of the current global   financial crisis. What performance strategies are embedded in the   mobility of exiles and \u00e9migr\u00e9s? What becomes of a national theater in   a transnational world? How are actors trained in Ireland today, and   how does the Irish accent sound as it projects across borders? In   addition to canonical and contemporary plays, we will watch the   high-stepping spectacle of Riverdance and see Ireland get ready for its   close-up in Hollywood. This course aims to give students a chance to engage   with a wide range of current literary and cultural debates concerning   cosmopolitanism, trans-nationalism, localism, and world form, and to ask   how contesting definitions and dramatizations of each term have conditioned   Ireland\u2019s entry into our era of high globalization. Working on   individual research projects \u2013 which we will address collaboratively in the   classroom \u2013 students will use and create digital archives of the   production/reception of Irish works of art on other continents. We   will study plays by authors such as Dion Boucicault, J.M. Synge, Samuel   Beckett, Brian Friel, Marie Jones, Seamus Heaney, Martin McDonagh, Marina   Carr, Bisi Adigun, Roddy Doyle and others.             Topics in Irish Literary, Visual, &amp;   Performing Arts:    Irish Dance Performance: Tradition, Modernity, and Innovation - What   We Think of That JIG We Do       IRISH-UA 902. 4 points.    Over the course of the last two decades, Irish Dance has changed enormously   and irreversibly. From the exclusive world of competition governed by the   auspices of An Coimisium le Rinci Gaelacha (the Irish Dancing Commission)   to the advent of the spectacle shows in the Mid-90's and beyond, a dynamic   shift in the global perception of the form has consequently challenged   notions of authenticity, tradition, and modernity. Throughout this course,   we shall develop a basic knowledge of the history and lexicon of Irish   Dance, and will use that as a departure point for broader theoretical   considerations.        We will look at traditional form,   stylistic variations and the peripheral influences that shape them. The   course will also examine choreographic innovation, theatrical settings, and   artistic visions of seminal works ranging from the popular, such as    Riverdance, Lord of the Dance and Dancing   on Dangerous Ground , to the contemporary expressions of solo   practitioners.           The course aim is to stimulate a process   of reading expressive form by examining varying aesthetics through critical   thinking, and to contextualize the multifaceted influences that continue to   shape our perception of Irish Dance Performance.         Jean Butler has won numerous awards at   regional, national, and world competitions in Irish Dance over her 30 year   career. She was co-choreographer and principal female lead in the   original production of Riverdance ,   and has gone onto a successful solo career as dancer, choreographer, and   artist-in-residence with musical groups (including The Chieftains),   Ireland's National Theater The Abbey, the World Academy of Music and Dance   at the University of Limerick and New York's Danspace   Project.       Independent Study       IRISH-UA 0998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate   studies is required. 2 or 4 points per term.    Independent study with an Irish studies faculty member.       NYU in Dublin       The focus of NYU's summer program in Dublin is contemporary Ireland and   its culture. The program is centered at Trinity College, Ireland's oldest   university, situated in the heart of Dublin, where students reside and take   classes. Courses are open to NYU and non-NYU students, both graduate and   undergraduate, and include Irish literature, history, politics, visual and   performing arts, creative writing, popular culture and the Irish language.   The academic program is complemented by a series of field trips and   cultural and social activities designed to broaden students' knowledge of   Ireland.

Freshman Seminar: What Are They Talking   About?: Oral History in the 21st Century       FRSEM-UA 482.001 4   points. Long before the technology of today's social media,   cultures, families and individuals shared their personal and community   stories in an oral tradition that preserved the past for future   generations. We will examine the discipline and evolution of oral history   using the Oral History Collection of Glucksman Ireland House to explore how   and why oral histories contribute to our understanding of the past and can   help to shape the identity of individuals and communities.       This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an   interdisciplinary approach to the methodology of oral history, its   significance as a resource, its role in historical research, as well as   specific interviewing and research techniques. Students will gain access to   our Archive of Irish America and have the opportunity to work with the   interviews we have already deposited, including how the university's   digital mapping technology can applied in our analysis of the   archive. Students will also have the chance to conduct an interview   themselves. The course comprises classroom lectures, readings, and   extensive writing exercises; it offers real world experience and   communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout   students' academic and professional careers.                                          &Aacute;ras Glucksman na h&Eacute;ireann                      Ollscoil Nua Eabhrac                  Glucksman Ireland House                  New York University                  One Washington Mews                  New York, NY 10003                  U.S.A.

Important modern artists such as the Mexican muralists, Frida Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila do Amaral, Wifredo Lam, and the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

After considering the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, the course examines the Gothic revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic, Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane, Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White; Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.    Modern Architecture: 1914 to the Present    ARTH-UA 409 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 (ARTH-UA 408), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.    Social History of Photography    ARTH-UA 432 Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.

A principal objective of the course is to have students learn to read the historical stratigraphy of the city by using primary and secondary sources such as maps, prints, and panoramas, as well as City Council minutes and other printed documents. The goal is to have them deepen their understanding of phenomena that they have observed firsthand.    Architectural Criticism    ARTH-UA 678 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 4 points.   Combines the reading and writing of architectural criticism. Students read the work of prewar and postwar architecture critics, focusing on those who live(d) and work(ed) in New York City and those who write and wrote for the popular press. Six class sessions are devoted to thematic groupings of reviews\u2014on the skyscraper, the museum, urban planning, and more\u2014in order to compare critical language, approach, and taste, while also tracking changes in architectural style from 1900 to the present. These reviews are supplemented with readings in architectural theory that attempt to define the styles of the past and present century. Students also write three reviews themselves, including one on a building, shop, or urban plan of their choice. The course should offer both an alternative history of 20th-century New York City and an opportunity to think and write about architecture in a new and opinionated way.    Parks, Plants, and People    ARTH-UA 679 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered periodically. 2 points.   Studies the components of successful urban green public spaces designed for and about people. Students participate in numerous site visits to important New York City parks and gardens to study the way people actually use these places. Students also are expected to visit others and report on them to the class. Students study the research and observations of William H. Whyte and the role that good planting and a connection with nature play in improving the quality of life in the city.    Case Studies in Historic Preservation    ARTH-UA 681 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered in the spring. 4 points.   A survey of the history, philosophy, and practice of historic preservation on the national and local levels. Through case studies, students learn about the field as a civic responsibility and public activity. It is, therefore, very much a course in civics, as it aims to equip and energize students to be involved in the quality of the built environment in general and historic preservation in particular wherever they may live, and wherever their professional paths may take them.

The courses utilize conversation and song, and aim to promote   fluency in spoken Irish as well as proficiency in reading and writing.   Students progress to conversation, translations, compositions, and readings   from contemporary Irish literature. They also participate in Irish-speaking   events at Glucksman Ireland House. The Irish language fulfills NYU's    Morse   Academic Plan language requirement .       Elementary Irish I       IRISH-UA 0100 Identical to EURO-UA 0100. Open to students with no   previous training in Irish. 4 points.    This course introduces students to the rudiments of the Irish language,   including phonemes and pronunciation, syntactical structure, and verbal   conjugations. In addition, a history of the language is provided, as well   as a general introduction to Irish culture, including discussions of family   and place names. Students are encouraged to begin speaking with basic   sentence structures.       Elementary Irish II       IRISH-UA 0101 Identical to EURO-UA 0101. Continuation of IRSH-UA   0100 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    This course builds on the grammatical lessons of Elementary Irish I and   expands into more complex verbal conjugations while concentrating on   idiomatic expressions. The accumulation of vocabulary is stressed and   students are introduced to basic literature in Irish while developing   beginning conversational fluency.       Intermediate Irish I       IRISH-UA 0102 Identical to EURO-UA 0102. Prerequisite: IRSH-UA   0101 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    For the more advanced student of Irish, this course focuses on improving   conversational fluency and on expanding vocabulary through reading more   complex literature in Irish.       Intermediate Irish II       IRISH-UA 0103 Identical to EURO-UA 0103. Continuation of IRSH-UA   0102 or assignment by placement examination or department permission. 4   points.    The focus of this course is on conversational fluency, strengthening   students pronunciation and command of the language. This will be supported   by reading novellas suitable for adult learners, songs, poetry, folklore   and group activities.       Introduction to Celtic Music       IRISH-UA 0152 Identical to MUSIC-UA 0151. 4 points.    This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the traditional and   contemporary music of the Celtic areas of Western Europe\u2014Ireland, Scotland,   Wales, Brittany, and Galicia. Recordings and live performances present the   extraordinary range of singing styles and the musical instruments employed   in each culture, including harps, bagpipes and a variety of other wind,   free reed, keyboard and stringed instruments. Forms and musical styles are   explored in depth along with a study of their origin, evolution, and   cultural links.       Global Diaspora the Irish Case       IRISH-UA 170.001    The Irish have exemplified global patterns of migration over centuries.   This course aims at a systematic exploration of the dispersal of Irish   people around the world, focusing on their interaction with the various   host cultures they have encountered both as settlers and in other roles.   Particular attention will be given to the movements of Irish on the   European continent and in Britain, the United States and Canada, the   Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand and South America. We will study   the consequences of emigration for Ireland and for the receiving nations,   as well as Ireland's transformation in the late twentieth century from   emigrant nursery to an emigrant destination. Starting with a chronological   focus, the class them moves to a more geographic concentration on some of   the most prominent Irish diasporic communities. As well as drawing on the   literature extant in the field, this class will make use of oral histories,   film and audio sources to explore the relevant themes and topics.       The Irish &amp; New York       IRISH-UA 0180 Identical to HIST-UA 0180 and METRO-UA 0325. 4   points.    This course considers the symbiotic relationship between a developing   metropolis and an immigrant people since the 18th century, with a special   concentration on significant mid-19th century political, social and   cultural changes when New York City was dramatically altered by the   Irish. The ultimate goal of this course is to learn to think   critically about the past. Students will (1) explore how certain   themes and events are used to define and mythologize the urban and ethnic,   and (2) consider the factors beyond race and language which help define and   preserve ethnic group identity over time. Student projects in new   media will be encouraged.       Topics in Irish History       IRISH-UA 0181 Identical to HIST-UA 0181. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow   flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in   particular fields. Past examinations have included imagery and ideology of   Irish nationalism, Irish American popular folk culture, and the Irish in   America.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 181.001 - Ireland and   America since 1920    This course examines the history of Ireland (including Northern Ireland),   the United States, and significantly Irish America, as they intersect or   diverge over the course of the twentieth century. When Northern   Ireland was created in 1920 and the Irish Free State in 1922, there were   2.3 million Irish-born living in America, nearly half the population of the   entire island. A new phase in Irish-American relations began during   which diplomacy, economics, education, immigration, nationalism, tourism,   culture, philanthropy and the circulatory movement of capital emerged as   major arenas for interaction. Through readings, films, oral history   and discussions that highlight the comparative element of this course,   students will examine key themes that connect Ireland and the United States   in this period as well as interrogating an emerging historiography.       Section 2 - IRISH-UA 181.002 -   Global History of Irish-Speaking Ireland, 1500-Present    Irish (or Gaelic), the language spoken by a majority of the Irish people up   until the beginning of the nineteenth century, has played a major role in   the history of Ireland and its wider global diaspora. The medium of one of   the earliest vernacular literatures in Europe, the subsequent decline in   the number of its speakers prompted a move to restore it as part of the   creation of an independent Ireland. This course will trace the history of   the Irish-speaking community, starting with samples (in English   translation) of early modern prose and poetry, and followed by a look at   the fortunes of the Irish-speaking community in the nineteen century in   Ireland, North America, and Australia. Finally, the last third of the   course will take up the subject of its revival, the status of Irish in a   fully independent state, and the politics of language in Northern   Ireland.       History of Modern Ireland, 1580-1800       IRISH-UA 0182 Identical to HIST-UA 0182. 4 points.    Examines the English conquest of Ireland from the reign of Elizabeth I to   the last meeting of the Irish Parliament. Key themes include the plantation   of Ireland with settlers from England, Scotland, and Wales, the decline of   the Gaelic political order and culture, the religious reformation and   Counter Reformation, Ireland as a site of English and European wars, the   imposition of a penal code, and the vain attempt to rebel against British   rule in the late 18th century resulting in the Act of Union, which   disestablished the Irish Parliament in Dublin.       History of Modern Ireland, 1800 to the present       IRISH-UA 0183 Identical to HIST-UA 0183. 4 points.    This class explores topics of conquest, collaboration, assimilation,   resistance and migration through the prism of the Ireland, in the years   since 1800. Particular attention is paid to the complex geopolitical   relationship that has existed between Ireland and her nearest neighbor,   Britain. The Act of Union is located in the context of a panoramic survey   of the condition of Ireland on the eve of incorporation into the United   Kingdom. We look at the place of the historical memory in fashioning   inherited identities shaped most explicitly by nationalism. The Irish   diaspora is another important part of this course and is a theme that spans   the centuries. We excavate the complex links between culture, language,   politics and identity, and expressed in a variety of movements in Ireland   and abroad. By starting with the emergence of nationalism in the nineteenth   century we can gain an understanding of the political impulses that shaped   twentieth-century Irish history. In the aftermath of revolution, a bitter   civil war and partition, the island saw two state-building projects emerge   catering to the needs of two jurisdictions divided along political,   cultural and economic priorities. We plot out the most significant aspects   of the division that has characterized the history and shed light on the   dynamic of Ireland's more recent history.       Seminar in Irish History       IRISH-UA 185 4 points.    Intensive examination of specific areas of Irish history with an emphasis   on critical reading and individual research projects. Past themes include   the development and modernization of the Republic of Ireland with   particular consideration of the economy; the Great Famine of 1845-1851,   which was an immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people but   which was also the catalyst for substantial changes - positive and negative   - in Irish society and culture; and the cinematic representations of Irish   Americans.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 185.001 -   The Largest Irish City in the World: New York City, 1880: A Geographical   and Statistical Analysis    In the year 1880, following over a century of robust migration links   between Ireland and the eastern seaboard of the U.S., three-quarters of a   million residents of New York City could claim Irish ancestry, with a third   of these first-generation immigrants. It is this population that will serve   as the basis for a semester-long research investigation of the demographic,   social, and cultural dynamics variables of these residents as revealed in   the 1880 U.S. census. The course will be built around student acquisition,   via labs, of a set of analytical techniques, including statistical   sampling, demographic data analysis, and database construction, as well as   student application of ArcGIS and stats software. Among the digital and   statistical skills imparted in this class will be understanding demographic   dataset structures and design, learning approaches to regularizing and   \u201ccleaning\u201d rough data for effective analysis, user training in IPUMS-USA   data resources, and use of ArcGIS to organize and manage geographically   variant historic data within an urban setting using georeferencing. In   addition, the course will impart firm historical knowledge of the time   period with readings and discussion on the material culture, social   characteristics, and living conditions of Irish populations in nineteenth   century New York and Ireland.  Section   2  - IRISH-UA 185.002 - Sport and Empire   since 1800    The impact of empires, above all the British, after about 1800,   transformed the role of organized sport over much of the globe. But   there were wide variations in the responses of both indigenous and settler   cultures to the opportunities offered, and the challenges, or even threats,   to indigenous identities, posed by the spread of sporting   activity. A host of questions arise, requiring analysis of the   ideological, military, political, religious, social and cultural factors   influencing the wide variety of responses. How closely are sporting   identities/cultures woven into the texture of the national   identities/cultures of their countries? How close is the connection between   sporting identity and other identities like race, class and gender,   themselves also undergoing processes of change. We will also explore   the decline of the major European empires on sporting and   cultural identities at global level.      Section 3 - IRISH-UA 185.003 -   Media, Discourse, and Irish America    This course will explore the ways in which a specific immigrant group has   been portrayed in various media over two centuries, with a particular   emphasis on the visual construction of ethnicity in mediums like film and   advertising. It will concentrate on the images that have been used to   characterize the Irish who live in the United States, analyze the roots of   that imagery, consider the implications of ethnic representation for   Ireland and its American diaspora, as well as the impact of popular culture   on identity formation. Section 4   - IRISH-UA 185.004 - Resurrecting the Ethnic Village: Research   Methods on Irish New York    One of the hallmarks of New York City is ethnic succession which, by its   very nature, renders the past invisible in the modern city. This   course focuses on the mid-nineteenth century when immigration from Ireland   dramatically altered New York politically, socially and culturally.   Students will study an Irish neighborhood in lower Manhattan using   traditional and modern methods of historical research. They will work   alone and in groups on a project which involves the collection of textual,   numeric, and visual data, including fieldwork in Chinatown. They will   acquire basic skills in data management, analysis, and presentation through   hands-on lab work with spreadsheets, Google Products, and   geographic/spatial programs.        The Irish in America       IRISH-UA 0187 Indentical to HIST-UA 0187. 4 points.     From the seventeenth century to the present, Irish people   have been crossing the Atlantic to North America. They are one of the most   significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States.   Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only   partially explains our contemporary understanding of \"Irish America.\"   Ethnicity is an imprint and defining feature of American life yet the Irish   experience with it over the past four centuries is a story complicated by   multiple generations, diversity of class, continuing immigration, and rapid   changes in both the homeland and the receiving country. This course will   consider the factors affecting emigration from Ireland; examine the impact   of the Irish on the development of the United States since the colonial   period, particularly on its cities; study the changing Irish image in   American popular culture; and consider what the Irish can teach us about   the evolution of ethnic identity. The ultimate goal of this course is to   learn to think historically.       Oral History of Irish America       IRISH-UA 203. 4 points.    The Oral History of Irish America seminar is a unique undergraduate   experience that offers students a small class size (typically no more than   8 students), an interdisciplinary approach to oral history that introduces   students to the methodology, its significance as a resource, its role in   historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the   opportunity to create an original public history document that will be   deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by   researchers. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen   from the Irish American community in New York City. The seminar provides an   opportunity to meet and work with dynamic, involved citizens from all walks   of life. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an   Oscar and Pulitzer prize-winning playwright and director, as well as   actors, musicians, teachers and Wall Street executives, among many   others. In addition to interviewing this person, the student will   produce a package that includes a biography, interview finding guide, and   content for a website. Part of the background research for the   project will be drawn from classroom lectures and readings adapted to   illuminate the life histories of the interview subjects chosen for the   semester to help students place their subjects in context, in addition to   students' independent research efforts. Students should be aware that   the final project requires extensive editing and rewriting because it will   be deposited in the Archives and published on the Glucksman Ireland House   Oral History website. The seminar offers real-world skills applicable   to many career paths, as well as a publication that can be cited on a   student's CV.       For examples of previous student work see:    http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/aia/collections/ihoral/oral01.htm .   For more information about the course on Oral History of Irish America,   please see our special Oral History   Project page .       Cinematic Representations of Irish   Americans       IRISH-UA 204. 4 points.     The visual image is central to the history of the   twentieth century. This course will explore the ways in which a   specific immigrant group has been portrayed in the media, especially in   feature films from the silent era to the present. It will concentrate   on the variety of images that have been used to characterize the Irish who   live in the United States, analyze the roots of that imagery and the   implications of cinematic representation for Irish American   history. Students will learn how to \"read\" American cinema as   documentary evidence of the visual construction of ethnicity. Through   writing assignments that group films, students will apply increasing   degrees of analysis to thematic, comparative, and chronological changes in   representation during the twentieth century. The skills acquired in   this seminar should translate into a heightened awareness of the   relationship between ethnicity and all forms of media in contemporary   American popular culture.       Contemporary Irish Politics and Society       IRISH-UA 0515 Identical to EURO-UA 0515. 4 points.     An examination of the politics of contemporary Ireland,   north and south. The course focuses on political, governmental, and   constitutional developments in the Republic of Ireland since independence   and discusses the causes of conflict and the prospect of resolution in   Northern Ireland.          The Irish Renaissance       IRISH-UA 0621 Identical to ENGL-UA 0621. 4 points.    This course seeks to understand the extraordinary achievements of Irish   writers in the last decade of the 19th and the first third of the 20th   century. We will read widely in all the different genres \u2014 poetry,   polemic, short story, novel, drama \u2014 that were remade by Irish writers   during the tumultuous period from the fall of Charles Stuart Parnell into   the early years of national government in the 1930s. Authors read on   the course include Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, George   Bernard Shaw, Lady Augusta Gregory, John Synge, Sean O'Casey, Elizabeth   Bowen, Flann O'Brien and others. We will balance our readings of   literature with consideration of the social and historical contexts of   Ireland under the Union with Britain, and after that Union was partially   broken. In attempting to refine the proper lens through which to view   this literature, we will address a number of salient issues, including the   nature and cultural forms of Irish cultural nationalism, the violence of   civil war, the social position of literature and of intellectuals in   projects of national reconciliation and national identity, and the clash   between revolutionary anti-imperialism and conservative Catholicism,   between rural and urban identities, between provincialism and   cosmopolitanism as strategies for literary self-fashioning.       Irish American Literature       IRISH-UA 0622 Identical to ENGL-UA 0622. 4 points.    The course examines Irish American literature from the 19th century to the   present, considering the literary responses of generations of Irish   immigrants as they strove to understand and contribute to the American   experience. The works of writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Eugene   O'Neill, Flannery O'Connor, John O'Hara, and William Kennedy are explored,   as are the connections between ethnic and literary cultures.       Colloquium: James Joyce       IRISH-UA 0625 Identical to ENGL-UA 0625. 4 points.    This course is an in-depth consideration of all of the major works of James   Joyce, from the early short stories of Dubliners to the late   experimental prose/poetry of Finnegan's Wake ; it concentrates,   however, on a detailed and systematic reading of Ulysses .    The biographical and social/historical contexts of Joyce's work are   investigated alongside consideration of his pathbreaking formal experiments   and his relations with the many currents of literary and artistic   Modernism. Discussion of Ulysses is complimented by consideration of   the many forms of literary and critical theory that have been fashioned   around readings of the book.       Irish Dramatists       IRISH-UA 0700 Identical to DRAMA-UA 0603, DRALIT-UA 0700, and   ENGL-UA 0700. 4 points.    A study of the rich dramatic tradition of Ireland since the days of William   Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, and the fledgling Abbey Theatre. Playwrights   covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett,   Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin.   Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged   alongside an appreciation of the emotional texture, poetic achievements,   and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic   work.       Topics in Irish Literature       IRISH-UA 761 Identical to ENGL-UA 761. 4 points.    The emphasis of this course varies by semester and is designed to allow   flexibility in course offerings by Ireland House faculty and by visiting   scholars.       Section 1 - IRISH-UA 761.001 - Visualizing Modern Ireland: Art and Literature in the   20th Century       Ireland has a reputation as a small nation with an outsized literary   heritage. Far less often do we think of Irish artists on an international   scale. Nonetheless, the country had a vibrant visual arts culture   throughout the twentieth-century. Did Irish artists and Irish writers   working at the same time perceive their nation and their world in the same   way? How did culture and politics shape literary and artistic movements in   Ireland? This course will attempt to answer these questions through an   exploration of the concurrent and overlapping literary and visual arts   movements in Ireland from approximately 1900 through the 1980s.                 Section 2 - IRISH-UA 761.002 -   Modernism, Translation &amp; Feminism: Irish Poetry 1893-2000    This course will introduce students to the most significant poets in Irish   from the establishment of the Gaelic League in 1893 to the end of the   twentieth century through a close reading of a selection of their poems   with English translations. The politics and practice of translation from a   minority to a majority language will be discussed as well as local Irish   adaptations to international ideas and influences such as modernism and   feminism. The course will also consider the historical context in which   individual poets emerged and the critical debates that shaped both the   writing itself and the readerly response to their work. The course will be   taught by eminent visiting professor Dr. Louis De Paor of National   University of Ireland - Galway. Dr. Louis de Paor, Director of the   Centre for Irish Studies at the National University of Ireland, Galway is a   multi-award winner of the Oireachtas literary competitions and holds his   PhD in Modern Irish from the National University of Ireland. A well-known   poet that works within the Irish language, De Paor's poetry collections   include &lt;em&gt;Pr\u00f3ca solais is luatha&lt;/em&gt;, (1988), &lt;em&gt;30   d\u00e1n&lt;/em&gt; (1992) and his most recent collection titled &lt;em&gt;Agus   Rud Eile De/ And Another Thing&lt;/em&gt; (2010). Dr. de Paor is   currently Senior Irish Language Fulbright Scholar as New York University   for the Fall 2013 semester.       Section 3 - IRISH-UA 761.003 -   Globalization and Irish Drama    This class on Irish drama will examine the many ways that Irish playwrights   have reached out to the world and the ways the world has staged the works   of Irish playwrights. With increased opportunities for theatrical   productions to travel internationally, dramatists of the past 25 years have   sought new strategies for adapting their work to a global   marketplace. We will journey with familiar plays as they are   performed on a world stage (Lady Gregory in Australia, Beckett in Sarajevo)   and will consider how contemporary playwrights have reflected on cultural   tensions within Ireland: debates about multiculturalism, the   influence of new media, and the social impact of the current global   financial crisis. What performance strategies are embedded in the   mobility of exiles and \u00e9migr\u00e9s? What becomes of a national theater in   a transnational world? How are actors trained in Ireland today, and   how does the Irish accent sound as it projects across borders? In   addition to canonical and contemporary plays, we will watch the   high-stepping spectacle of Riverdance and see Ireland get ready for its   close-up in Hollywood. This course aims to give students a chance to engage   with a wide range of current literary and cultural debates concerning   cosmopolitanism, trans-nationalism, localism, and world form, and to ask   how contesting definitions and dramatizations of each term have conditioned   Ireland\u2019s entry into our era of high globalization. Working on   individual research projects \u2013 which we will address collaboratively in the   classroom \u2013 students will use and create digital archives of the   production/reception of Irish works of art on other continents.

Topics in Irish Literary, Visual, &amp;   Performing Arts:    Irish Dance Performance: Tradition, Modernity, and Innovation - What   We Think of That JIG We Do       IRISH-UA 902. 4 points.    Over the course of the last two decades, Irish Dance has changed enormously   and irreversibly. From the exclusive world of competition governed by the   auspices of An Coimisium le Rinci Gaelacha (the Irish Dancing Commission)   to the advent of the spectacle shows in the Mid-90's and beyond, a dynamic   shift in the global perception of the form has consequently challenged   notions of authenticity, tradition, and modernity. Throughout this course,   we shall develop a basic knowledge of the history and lexicon of Irish   Dance, and will use that as a departure point for broader theoretical   considerations.        We will look at traditional form,   stylistic variations and the peripheral influences that shape them. The   course will also examine choreographic innovation, theatrical settings, and   artistic visions of seminal works ranging from the popular, such as    Riverdance, Lord of the Dance and Dancing   on Dangerous Ground , to the contemporary expressions of solo   practitioners.           The course aim is to stimulate a process   of reading expressive form by examining varying aesthetics through critical   thinking, and to contextualize the multifaceted influences that continue to   shape our perception of Irish Dance Performance.         Jean Butler has won numerous awards at   regional, national, and world competitions in Irish Dance over her 30 year   career. She was co-choreographer and principal female lead in the   original production of Riverdance ,   and has gone onto a successful solo career as dancer, choreographer, and   artist-in-residence with musical groups (including The Chieftains),   Ireland's National Theater The Abbey, the World Academy of Music and Dance   at the University of Limerick and New York's Danspace   Project.

Lectures on still life painting and polychrome wood sculpture are also included. The 18th century (the Tiepolo family, Mel\u00e9ndez) is then discussed. The focus then shifts to the art of Francisco de Goya and the projection of Spanish art into the modern era. This course also seeks to define Spain in the 16th and 17th century as a global power and thus emphasis is also placed on art in such New World centers as Mexico City and Lima in the colonial era.    Latin American Art: From Colonial to Modern    ARTH-UA 316 Identical to MEDI-UA 316 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Major emphasis is given to colonial painting, sculpture, and architecture in Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican muralists, Frida Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila do Amaral, Wifredo Lam, and the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Focusing on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol, museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, the course examines the Gothic revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic, Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane, Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White; Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.    Modern Architecture: 1914 to the Present    ARTH-UA 409 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 (ARTH-UA 408), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Chronicles the history of photography's complex and symbiotic relationship to the other visual arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, installation, and performance, among others. Beginning with the medium's invention and the early fights of its practitioners to establish themselves as fine artists, the course describes photographers' unique attempts to negotiate their relationships with both artistic movements and the media culture of which they are a part. Robinson, Cameron, Emerson, F. Holland Day, Stieglitz, Moholy-Nagy, Rodchenko, Weston, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Lartigue, De Carava, Cahun, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, and Cindy Sherman (among others) are seen within the context of their respective art worlds, so the impact of art movements, cultural attitudes, and new technologies on photographers during different historical periods can be assessed.    Social History of Photography    ARTH-UA 432 Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.    Art in the Islamic World I: From the Prophet to the Mongols    ARTH-UA 540 Offered periodically. 4 points.

The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world.

Offered every year. 4 points.   Serves as a laboratory for the investigation of New York City's infrastructure, using the definition of the word as a point of departure. In what ways can the city be perceived as a collective undertaking, with intricate components interwoven in continuous strands? What systems and forces give the city and its neighborhoods their current form, and what influences their future shape? Can these systems be dissected? What do these analyses tell us about the relationship of the city to its inhabitants and to the wider environment? Through lectures, reading assignments, discussions, and field trips, we investigate some of the major components of the city's infrastructure, such as the street grid, water supply, waste disposal, and subway system.

Drawing for Architects and Others    ARTH-UA 676 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 2 points.   A basic drawing course intended to teach students to perceive\u2014to record phenomena manually without relying on formulaic methods of drawing perspective, volumetrics, and the like. Students are encouraged to examine proportion, scale, light, shade, and texture, as well as means of expression, the nature and essence of objects, various media, and graphic composition. The course assists students in creating a comprehensive series of drawings and in building a portfolio.    Reading the City    ARTH-UA 677 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on observation and documentation of a historical section of New York City from its foundation to the present. Students participate in field walks and attend in-class lectures and discussions. A principal objective of the course is to have students learn to read the historical stratigraphy of the city by using primary and secondary sources such as maps, prints, and panoramas, as well as City Council minutes and other printed documents. The goal is to have them deepen their understanding of phenomena that they have observed firsthand.    Architectural Criticism    ARTH-UA 678 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director.

Six class sessions are devoted to thematic groupings of reviews\u2014on the skyscraper, the museum, urban planning, and more\u2014in order to compare critical language, approach, and taste, while also tracking changes in architectural style from 1900 to the present. These reviews are supplemented with readings in architectural theory that attempt to define the styles of the past and present century. Students also write three reviews themselves, including one on a building, shop, or urban plan of their choice. The course should offer both an alternative history of 20th-century New York City and an opportunity to think and write about architecture in a new and opinionated way.    Parks, Plants, and People    ARTH-UA 679 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director.

Offered in the spring. 4 points.   A survey of the history, philosophy, and practice of historic preservation on the national and local levels. Through case studies, students learn about the field as a civic responsibility and public activity. It is, therefore, very much a course in civics, as it aims to equip and energize students to be involved in the quality of the built environment in general and historic preservation in particular wherever they may live, and wherever their professional paths may take them.

Survey Courses in Dramatic Literature    Introduction to Drama and Theatre DRLIT-UA 101 Offered periodically. 4 points. A general introduction to the study of dramatic literature as well as to the very notion of theatre and its place in our cultural life, both past and present. Topics include the emergence of new dramatic genres and forms, the relation between \u201chigh culture\u201d and popular performance, the changing nature and activity of play-going, theories of character and action, the aesthetics of theatre production, the politics of representation, the idea of human and inhuman in performance, the globalization of theatre, and the urbanization of the performing arts, especially in New York. Eight to ten representative plays are read and discussed alongside various writing about the theatre. History of Drama and Theatre I, II DRLIT-UA 110, 111 Identical to ENGL-UA 125, 126. Either term may be taken alone for credit. 4 points per term.   Examines selected plays central to the development of world drama, with critical emphasis on a cultural, historical, and theatrical analysis of these works. The first semester covers the major periods of Greek and Roman drama; Japanese classical theatre; medieval drama; theatre of the English, Italian, and Spanish Renaissance; and French neoclassical drama. The second semester begins with English Restoration and 18th-century comedy and continues through romanticism, naturalism, and realism to an examination of antirealism and the major dramatic currents of the 20th century, including postcolonial theatre in Asia, Africa, and Australia.    Advanced Electives in Dramatic Literature    Acting Medieval Literature   DRLIT-UA 35 Identical to MEDI-UA 868. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of \"books\" to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, perform a substantial piece of narrative poetry, sing or play a body of medieval songs, or a similar endeavor.    Naturalism   DRLIT-UA 113 Identical to THEA-UA 705. 4 points.   A study of the origins and development of the most influential dramatic movements of the 20th century. Specific topics vary by term and instructor.    Modern Drama: Expressionism and Beyond   DRLIT-UA 114 Identical to THEA-UA 602. 4 points.   A study of the various formal movements that developed in reaction to realism. After examining several 19th-century antecedents, including Buchner, we study the most important experimental styles of each successive era: symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, epic theatre, the theatre of the absurd, and postmodernism. Authors covered include Maeterlinck, Kaiser, Pirandello, Lorca, Beckett, Genet, Bond, Handke, Muller, and Benmussa. The philosophical context is explored through reading Freud, Marx, Sartre, and Derrida; theoretical readings include essays by Artaud and Brecht. While the class focus is on the many styles that evolved in the 20th-century search for a more expressive form, some attention is given to how this search still very much influences theatre artists today.    Theory of Drama   DRLIT-UA 130 Identical to ENGL-UA 130. 4 points.   Explores the relationship between two kinds of theories: theories of meaning and theories of practice. Among the theories of meaning to be studied are semiotics, deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, new historicism, and postmodernism. Theories of practice include naturalism, dadaism, futurism, epic theatre, theatre of cruelty, poor theatre, and environmental theatre. Theories are examined through theoretical essays and representative plays.    Gay and Lesbian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 137 Identical to THEA-UA 624. 4 points.   A survey of contemporary lesbian and gay plays from The Boys in the Band to Angels in America. The goal is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre.    Popular Performance   DRLIT-UA 138 Identical to THEA-UA 621. 4 points.   A reevaluation of a wide variety of European and American forms that, beginning in the 16th century, were separated from \"high culture\" theatre. These include fairground performance, commedia dell'arte, mummers' plays, circus, pantomime, minstrel shows, vaudeville, and carnival, puppet, and mask theatre. Exploration of what popular performance does differently than \"high culture\" theatre, how it does so, and to whom it addresses itself. A study of characteristic forms and techniques of popular performance, the connection between Western and non-Western forms, and the central role of popular performance in 20th-century theatre.    Topics in Italian Culture: Futurism in Italy   DRLIT-UA 174 Identical to ITAL-UA 173. 4 points.   Arguably the first avant-garde movement of the 20th century, futurism saw itself as a violent explosion that would drastically redefine not only the artistic landscape but reality as a whole. The futurists produced a theoretical program to overhaul literature, painting, theatre, architecture, music, politics, and even cooking. The approach of the movement's 100th birthday is an opportunity to assess its relevance for our understanding of modernity. This is an interdisciplinary course.    Tragedy   DRLIT-UA 200 Identical to ENGL-UA 720, COLIT-UA 110. 4 points.   Historical and critical study of the idea and practice of tragedy from Greek times to the present.    Greek Drama: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides   DRLIT-UA 210 Identical to CLASS-UA 143. 4 points.   Of the many gifts of the ancient Greeks to Western culture, one of the most celebrated and influential is the art of drama. This course covers, by way of the best available translations, the masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, including the place of the plays in the history of the drama and the continuing influence they have had on serious playwrights, including those of the 20th century.    Comedies of Greece and Rome   DRLIT-UA 211 Identical to CLASS-UA 144. 4 points.   Study of early comedy, its form, content, and social and historical background. Covers the Old Comedy of fifth-century Athens through the Attic New Comedy and Roman comedy. Authors include Aristophanes (11 comedies are studied, and one is staged); Euripides, whose tragedies revolutionized the form of both comedy and tragedy; Menander, whose plays were only recently discovered; and Plautus and Terence, whose works profoundly influenced comedy in Western Europe.    Shakespeare I, II   DRLIT-UA 225, 226 Identical to ENGL-UA 410, 411. Either term may be taken alone for credit. 4 points per term.   Introduction to the reading of Shakespeare.

Second term: the later tragedies, the problem plays, and the romances, concluding with The Tempest.    Colloquium: Shakespeare   DRLIT-UA 230 Identical to ENGL-UA 415. Assumes some familiarity with Shakespeare's works. Beginning students should take DRLIT-UA 225, 226. 4 points.   Explores the richness and variety of Shakespearean drama through an emphasis on the mastery of selected major plays. Six to eight plays are read intensively and examined thoroughly in discussion.    Restoration and 18th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 235 4 points.   The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to a 20-year period of civil war and military rule in England. As a postwar culture, Restoration England was a divided society, but also a society ripe for social change and cultural innovation. The London public theatres in this period, reopened after twenty years of prohibition, can be variously characterized as progressive vanguard and conservative rearguard, both an open forum for new ideas and subversive critique of the dominant culture, and a bastion of aristocratic privilege and state hegemony. This course considers the cultural activity of the Restoration public theatres from both outlooks. Embracing the divided nature of the art and culture of this period, the readings are organized into a series of unlikely pairings: urban comedies and classical tragedies, closet dramas and box-office successes, propaganda pieces and broad satires, puritan reform and libertine excess. Playwrights include Dryden, Davenant, Cavendish, Etherege, Wycherley, Rochester, Milton, Centlivre, Shadwell, Otway, and Farquhar.    Feminism and Theatre   DRLIT-UA 240 Identical to THEA-UA 623. 4 points.   A study of plays by female playwrights and feminist theatre from the perspective of contemporary feminist theory. Considerations include strategies for asserting new images of women on stage, the dramatic devices employed by female playwrights, lesbian aesthetics, race, class, and the rejection of realism. Possible plays and performance texts treated include those of Maria Irene Fornes, Caryl Churchill, Sarah Daniels, Wendy Wasserstein, Ntozake Shange, Adrienne Kennedy, Susan Glaspell, Aphra Behn, Alice Childress, Tina Howe, Holly Hughes, Karen Finley, Darrah Cloud, and Suzan-Lori Parks.    Modern British Drama   DRLIT-UA 245 Identical to ENGL-UA 614. 4 points.   Studies in the modern drama of England and Ireland, always focusing on a specific period, a specific group of playwrights, a specific dramatic movement of theatre, or a specific topic. Among playwrights covered at different times are Shaw, Synge, O'Casey, Behan, Osborne, Pinter, Stoppard, Bond, Friel, Storey, Hare, Edgar, Brenton, Gems, Churchill, and Daniels.    Modern American Drama   DRLIT-UA 250 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, SCA-UA 842. 4 points.   Study of the drama and theatre of America since 1900, including Eugene O'Neill, Susan Glaspell, the Group Theatre, Thornton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Maria Irene Fornes, and David Henry Hwang.    Theatrical Genres   DRLIT-UA 251 Identical to THEA-UA 632. 4 points.   This course (different each time) explores one or more distinctive theatrical genres, such as tragedy, comedy, melodrama, satire, or farce, or plays of distinctive theatrical types, such as theatre of the absurd, the documentary play, or theatre of witness. Since theatrical genres and theatrical types come into being because playwrights respond to historical necessity by visualizing specific worldviews, the course presents a study of the role and function of the theatre within societies, as a response to historical, psychological, and spiritual forces.    Modern U.S. Drama   DRLIT-UA 253 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, THEA-UA 608. 4 points.   A study of drama and theatre in the United States since 1900, including Eugene O'Neill, Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, Elmer Rice, Clifford Odets and the Group Theatre, Thorton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Emily Mann, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Maria Irene Fornes, Adrienne Kennedy, August Wilson, Lorraine Hansberry, David Henry Hwang, David Rabe, Luis Valdez, and Tony Kushner. We explore these writers and their texts as they relate to the page, to the stage, and to U.S. culture at large. We discuss how these writers (and others) represent themselves and notions of \"American-ness\" in their dramatic works. We include important works from the margins, as well as those that represent the mainstream. Does modern U.S. drama lead or follow U.S. culture? Does it tend to be a design for living or a reflection of custom? We also explore the role of gender in culture as demonstrated in these works. Does U.S. drama question the status quo or reinforce it? These and other interrogations inform our readings, discussions, and written assignments.    Major Playwrights   DRLIT-UA 254 Identical to ENGL-UA 652, THEA-UA 618. 4 points.   This course (different each time) focuses on two or three related major playwrights, for example, Brecht and Shaw, Chekhov and Williams, Churchill and Bond, Beckett and Pinter, Strindberg and O'Neill. Makes an in-depth study of their writings, their theories, and the production histories of their plays in relation to biographical, cultural, political, and aesthetic contexts.    African American Drama   DRLIT-UA 255 Identical to ENGL-UA 255, THEA-UA 605. 4 points.   The study of African American dramatic traditions from early minstrelsy to turn-of-the-century musical extravaganzas; from the Harlem Renaissance folk plays to realistic drama of the 1950s; from the militant protest drama of the 1960s to the historical and experimental works of the present. Issues of race, gender, class; of oppression and empowerment; of marginality and assimilation are explored in the works of such playwrights as Langston Hughes, Alice Childress, Lorraine Hansberry, Amiri Baraka, Adrienne Kennedy, Charles Fuller, George C. Wolfe, Ntozake Shange, August Wilson, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Anna Deavere Smith. The sociohistorical context of each author is also briefly explored. Asian American Theatre   DRLIT-UA 256 Identical to THEA-UA 606. 4 points.   Acts as both an introduction to the genre of Asian American theatre and an interrogation into how this genre has been constituted. Through a combination of play analysis and historical discussion\u2014starting with Frank Chen's The Chickencoop Chinaman, the first Asian American play produced in a mainstream venue\u2014the class looks at the ways Asian American drama and performance intersect with a burgeoning Asian American consciousness. We review the construction of Asian American history through such plays as Genny Lim's Paper Angels and more recent works such as Chay Yew's A Language of Their Own. We also read theoretical and historical texts that provide the basis for a critical examination of the issues surrounding Asian American theatre. Orientalism, media representation, and theories of genealogy inform our discussion.    Political Theatre   DRLIT-UA 258 Identical to THEA-UA 622. 4 points.   Major forms, plays, and theories of socially engaged theatre exemplifying performance as a site of resistance, social critique, and utopianism.

Comparative Study: 20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 261 4 points.   The two decades or so following World War II were a particularly exciting period in the history of drama in Europe and America. This course focuses on five playwrights\u2014Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Adrienne Kennedy, and Peter Weiss\u2014whose engagements with postwar history and politics shaped the form and content of their works for the stage. Questions include modes of representing historical experience, theatre and historical forms of spectatorship, and challenges to genre. The presumption is that we cannot know in advance what it means to describe a play as \"political.\" Readings include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and selected shorter plays; Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Orpheus Descending; Genet's The Balcony, The Blacks, and The Screens; Kennedy's Funnyhouse of a Negro, The Owl Answers, and A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White; and Weiss's Marat/Sade and The Investigation.    17th-Century Theatre   DRLIT-UA 290 4 points.   Explores plays written by Shakespeare's collaborators, rivals, and followers\u2014English drama in the age of Shakespeare written by playwrights other than Shakespeare. These are plays about world-conquering heroes, murderous conspirators, riotous good-fellows, and star-crossed lovers; they are also about the fast-changing culture of early modern England, dealing with new patterns of urban life, emergent notions of republican politics and personal liberty, the discovery of new worlds and new sciences, and the increasing pressures of European war, revolution, and civil war. A different play each week. Plays by Beaumont, Brome, Dekker, Fletcher, Ford, Jonson, Marlowe, Massinger, Middleton, Milton, Shirley, and Webster.    Theatre of Latin America   DRLIT-UA 293 Identical to THEA-UA 748. 4 points.   An introduction to the history, theories, and practices of Latin American drama, focusing on the 20th century.

We study the wealth of oppositional theatre in Latin America\u2014exemplified by Augusto Boal's \"theatre of the oppressed\"\u2014in relation to the historical use (or abuse) of theatrical spectacle as a political means to control peoples, from the early Spanish conquerors to recent authoritarian state leaders. We read postcolonial Latin American theories of culture and art, such as hybridity, transculturation, Brazil's modernist and anticolonial antropofagia, and the \"aesthetics of hunger,\" drawing on the work of Fernando Ortiz, Angel Rama, and Nestor Garcia Canclini, among others. We consider \"magical realism\" in the theatre as a social poetics of scarcity.    Theatre in Asia   DRLIT-UA 294 Identical to THEA-UA 744. 4 points.   This course (different each time) examines different traditions, innovations, representations, and locations of Asian theatre.

Emphasis is placed on theatrical forms that have been influenced by the theories of Artaud and the European avant-garde; John Cage and visual aesthetics related to American acting, painting, collage, and environmental and conceptual art. Types of performance studied include dadaist, surrealist, and futurist plays; multimedia happenings of Karpov, Oldenberg, and Whitman; conceptual self-works and solos of performers such as Vito Acconci, Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, and Diamanda Galas; and the work of avant-gardists such as Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, Meredith Monk, Ping Chong, Mabou Mines, LeCompte's Wooster Group, and Pina Bausch. Readings are supplemented by slides, videotape, and attendance at suggested performance events.    Drama in Performance   DRLIT-UA 300 Identical to ENGL-UA 132. 4 points.

Gender and Performance in the Italian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 720 Identical to ITAL-UA 720. 4 points.   Examines plays that explicitly highlight and question the status and performance of gender, as well as selections from political treatises, books of manners, and historiography of the early modern period (1350-1700). Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell'arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the development of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well as the \"revisions\" that women playwrights and writers made to a largely male-dominated canon.    20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 730 4 points.   Transportable Drama: Stock character types, dramatic figures, and archetypal plots are to a certain extent independent and transportable terms that appear and reappear in multiple play texts, versions of those texts, and in diverse media. Beyond that, the experience of what we call \"drama\" is not limited to play texts and their presentation; it is present in fiction, news, film, television, the visual and electronic arts, and advertising. In this course, we explore how the dramatic impulse of several plots, figures, and characters is expressed in play texts and other media across several historical periods. For example, we may choose to look at Zola's novel and play of Therese Raquin, followed by Marcel Carne's 20th-century film adaptation. Or, we might examine one or more of the historical Don Juan plays in combination with the Byron poem, the Mozart opera, and/or a modern film treatment. Similarly, Shakespearean texts have been widely adapted to the present day, not only in theatrical spin-offs and films, but also through renderings by visual artists. A play based upon a news event, such as Treadwell's Machinal, may be examined in light of the original reportage and public records. By looking at clusters of related works in tandem, rather than as freestanding objects of study, we will gain a greater understanding of drama as a transportable art form and of adaptation in both its practical and theoretical aspects.

This course (different every time) introduces students to the specific choices that a director must make to transform the \"printed word\" into a visual auditory experience. For example, point of view becomes a challenge of camera shots; a described room becomes a matter of lighting, color, and sound; and the sense of time becomes a product of editing, rhythm, music, and splicing. Throughout the course, we pit a director's view against an author's view to examine how the same story may express different agendas, depending on the rendering. Works may include Euripides' Medea (Pasolini), Nabokov's Lolita (Kubrick), Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire (Kazan), Paul Schrader's Taxi Driver (Scorsese), Virginia Woolf's Orlando (Potter), and Thomas Hardy's Tess (Polanski).

The intern's duties on-site should involve some substantive aspect of work in drama. The student is expected to fulfill the obligation of the internship itself, and a written evaluation is solicited from the outside sponsor at the end. The grade for the course is based on a final project submitted to a faculty director with whom the student has been meeting regularly over the semester to discuss the progress of the internship.    Independent Study   DRLIT-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate studies. May not duplicate the content of a regularly offered course. Intended for qualified upper-class majors or minors in this department, but may not be used to fulfill the minimum requirements of either the major or the minor. 2 or 4 points per term.   Requires a paper of considerable length that should embody the results of a semester's reading, thinking, and frequent conferences with the student's director. The paper should show the student's ability to investigate, collect, and evaluate his or her material, finally drawing conclusions that are discussed in a sound and well-written argument. In the 2-point course, the student is held to the same high standard as is the student who is working for 4 points, but the investigation and the paper are of proportionate length.    Honors Seminar    The subject of the Honors Seminar changes each year and is decided on by the faculty member teaching the seminar. The seminar is a small class (limited to 12) that ideally prepares students for the senior thesis; the primary focus is on research and the application of critical methodologies. Each year, one of the Department of English Junior Honors Seminars is also designated as the drama studies Honors Seminar, with at least a partial focus on drama. Drama studies majors normally take this seminar to complete the seminar requirement. (English majors in honors may also take this designated seminar if they choose to, subject to the 12-student limit.) Dramatic literature majors in honors may also satisfy the seminar requirement by taking, with the instructor's permission, the Honors Seminar in the undergraduate Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts.    Admission to the Drama Studies honors program is competitive. The Honors Seminars are limited to 12 students. The minimum GPA for admission to any College of Arts and Science honors program is 3.65 or better (both overall and in the major). In addition, students must have completed the two core courses History of Drama and Theatre I and II (DRLIT-UA 110 and 111) by the end of the semester in which they apply for the honors track.
