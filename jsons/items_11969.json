NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.                                                           Student Resource Center                                                                                         NYU TV & Media                                                                                         Spiritual Life at NYU                                            Student living at NYU is a unique experience of its own. Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.

NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.                                                           Student Resource Center                                                                                         NYU TV & Media                                                                                         Spiritual Life at NYU                                            Student living at NYU is a unique experience of its own. Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.

NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.                                                           Student Resource Center                                                                                         NYU TV & Media                                                                                         Spiritual Life at NYU                                            Student living at NYU is a unique experience of its own. Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.

The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview and permission of the director of internships.

Independent Study    Independent Study   SCA-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 2 to 4 points per term.      Elective Courses    Cities in a Global Context   SCA-UA 602 Offered in the spring. 4 points.   What is a global city? How does a global perspective shape our understanding of urban spaces and the politics of creating social and spatial order in cities? This course draws on ethnographic examples from a range of cultural and geographic contexts to explore 21st-century urbanization. Through examples that range from London to Shanghai, the course traces how issues like equity, migration, violence, ecology, and citizenship can inform an understanding of modern cities.    Urban Cultural Life   SCA-UA 608 4 points.   Few cities enjoy as rich a cultural life as New York City, with its galaxy of neighborhoods, museums, galleries, theatres, concert halls, and alternative spaces. Through walking tours, attendance at cultural events, and visits to local cultural institutions, students explore the definition of urban culture. Sites include the familiar and the unfamiliar, the Village and the outer boroughs. Students examine the attributes that constitute culture and community from an interdisciplinary perspective. Readings and films expand their understanding of these concepts.    Law and Urban Problems   SCA-UA 610 Offered in the fall. 4 points.   Interdisciplinary introduction to the law as it interacts with society. Focuses on problems in areas such as housing, zoning, welfare, and consumer affairs, emphasizing the underlying social, economic, and political causes of the problems and the responses made by lawmakers and courts. Readings are drawn from the law and social science. No specific knowledge of law is required.    Work and Wealth in the City: The Economics of Urban Growth   SCA-UA 612 Offered every other year. 4 points.   The financing of complex American cities raises related issues about the changing character of work in the city and the organization of wealth and city finances in contemporary urban America. This course examines a diverse set of questions about the forms of capital needed to maintain a city, the economics of regional development, the role of taxes in supporting services and urban development, the job structure of a metropolitan area, and the types of incentives necessary to maintain a diverse labor force.    Community Empowerment   SCA-UA 613 Offered in the spring. 4 points.   Empowerment is defined as those processes, mechanisms, strategies, and tactics through which people, as well as organizations and communities, gain mastery over their lives. It is personal as well as institutional and organizational. This course addresses these issues in a wide variety of community settings. The course is designed to be challenging and rewarding to those students interested in helping people work together to improve their lives.    Culture of the City   SCA-UA 620 Offered in the spring. 4 points.   Urban culture is a complex, fantastic part of daily life, encompassing everything from vaudeville, the public library, opera, and dance to the local bar, social club, and graffiti. By considering cities to be sources of cultural invention, this course explores, through literature, history, social science, and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and postmodernist. Emphasis is on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups and on how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict.    New York City in Film   SCA-UA 623 4 points.   Analyzes the way New York has been portrayed in some of the classic films about the city. In turn, the course examines how these stories have helped shape the city\u2019s image of itself. The goal is to see how each particular film originated at distinct moments both in the city\u2019s history as well as in the history of filmmaking. In so doing, the course combines the perspectives of both urban studies and film studies, placing films within their cultural, political, and artistic content.    Landscapes of Consumption   SCA-UA 625 Offered every year. 4 points.   Consumption of objects, images, and places is central to the culture and economy of metropolitan life. The class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: the late 19th century and the invention of urban commodity spectacles, post-war America and the rise of suburban consumer spaces, and contemporary America and the selling of the commodity city. The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How does landscape organize our consumer desires? How does place become an object of consumption? We begin with an examination of classic theoretical works that probe the relationships between people, things, and cities. We then embed these in discussions of changing forms and practices of consumption and urbanism. The empirical cases we examine range from the development of the department store, to the fashioning of the commodity city, to the work of shopping, and to the emergence of a thriving urban debt industry.    Urban Environmentalism   SCA-UA 631 Offered every other year. 4 points.   Explores environmental issues in urban centers, their causes and impacts, and the rise of a movement that considers the \u201cenvironment\u201d not just as the term we use to describe the natural world from which most urban residents feel dissociated, but rather as the array of places where we live, work and play. Considers the relationship between society and public policy in the context of environmentalism. Introduces students to public policy analysis, with a focus on policy implementation and decision-making in New York City. Examines the powers of the NYC Council and explains the role of agencies, the private sector, and interest groups as critical parts of a bureaucracy through which environmental issues are shaped, managed and negotiated. Through a variety of case studies, increases students' understanding of the political, legal, economic and technical and scientific constraints of the policy decision-making process and explores the path towards managing, using and protecting environmental resources in urban centers. Climate Change and Environmental Justice SCA-UA 632 Offered every other year. 4 points. This course will introduce students to the basic approaches to climate change, through readings from climatologists, economists, anthropologists, geographers, cultural analysts, and activists of various stripes. Consideration will be given to the \u201cdebate\u201d about climate change that has been generated by deniers and advocates for the fossil fuel industries. The context for discussing the natural and social impact of global warming will be further defined by examining the principles of climate justice. Modeled on the American-derived principles of environmental justice in the 1990s, the climate justice movement poses a legal and humanitarian challenge to champions of \u201cnatural capitalism\u201d who place their faith in market-driven solutions. Students will look at how populations are unevenly affected by climate change, and how this imbalance is being addressed by a range of advocates of decarbonization.
