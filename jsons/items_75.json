Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Wendy Suzuki Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  The NYU Mediation Lab VI: Startups at the Frontiers of Knowledge Edition AHSEM-UA 176 (class # 8186) Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The NYU Mediation Lab is open to ALL disciplines in FAS and to everyone who wishes to put their majors to work in the world. In your other classes this fall, you\u2019ll learn what\u2019s already in those majors. Our goal in this Lab is to figure out what\u2019s not in them\u2014yet. We\u2019ll begin by mapping the frontiers of knowledge in our subject areas by sharing our own areas of expertise and then heading out into the city for field research at other universities, as well as other institutions, from think tanks to museums. Our goal is to identify opportunities for startups like the ones that gave birth to Silicon Valley. We\u2019ll then all chose one and work collaboratively to make it happen. Its fate will be in your hands, and, instead of just a letter grade from me, you\u2019ll end the term by presenting what you\u2019ve built to an invited audience. [Since we will prepare ourselves by learning from \u201cstartups\u201d in the past, the Lab will have the added bonus for English majors of fulfilling the pre-1800 requirement.] Origin of the Lab: MIT has its famous Media Lab (media.mit.edu) to ask \u201cthe questions not yet asked\u2013questions whose answers could radically improve the way people live, learn, work, and play.\u201d At NYU, we go beyond the \u201cmedia\u201d to \u201cmediations\u201d of every kind\u2014to every strategy for turning the present into a better future. Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252.001.  Clifford Siskin is the Henry W. and Alfred A. Berg Professor of English and American Literature and the Director of The Re:Enlightenment Project. His subject is the interrelations of literary, social, and technological change. Links between past and present inform all of his work, from his sequencing of the genres of subjectivity ( The Historicity of Romantic Discourse ) to his recovery of literature\u2019s role in the formation of the modern disciplines ( The Work of Writing ). He is also co-editor, with William Warner, of This Is Enlightenment , and a forthcoming monograph that asks when and how the central genre of Enlightenment became the thing that we now love to blame: the SYSTEM. Narrating Poverty in Brazilian Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 186 (class # 17787) Instructor: Marta Peixoto Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30\u20134:45 p.m. This course, CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH, examines literary works in various genres (novels, autobiography, short stories), and Brazilian films (Cinema Novo and after, including documentaries), that attempt to narrate the experience of poverty. We will discuss texts by Graciliano Ramos, Carolina Maria de Jesus, Clarice Lispector, Rubem Fonseca, and Patricia Melo and view films ( Barren Lives, The Scavengers, The Hour of the Star, Pixote, Bus 174, City of God, Babil\u00f4nia 2000 and Black Orpheus ), in light of key questions. How do these texts reflect on the nature of representation and on the investments of author and reader in images of deprivation? How do they present the connections of poverty with violence, stigmatization, and citizenship rights? How do they frame the ethical responsibilities of the writer or film-maker, as well as of readers and spectators? What are the patterns of consumption and circulation of these texts? Cross-listed with Portuguese as PORT-UA 704.001. Marta Peixoto is Associate Professor of Spanish and Portuguese. Her studies focus on Brazilian literature and culture, and she has written books and essays on the major 20th-century writers Machado de Assis, Jo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto and Clarice Lispector, as well as on other novelists and poets. Her work draws on gender theory and more recently on theories of affect. She has also published essays on Brazilian cinema, focusing on representations of urban crises, on the blurring of distinctions between documentary and fiction, and on lyric aspects of recent documentary films. Love and Politics in Latin America AHSEM-UA 218 (class # 20883) Instructor: Perla Masi Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. This   course will explore the ways in which art, literature and activism   intersect with social and political power in modern and contemporary   Latin America. What is the peculiar relationship between poetic   practice, political action and love? How does the work of poets, visual   artists, filmmakers, photographers, and guerrilleros, testify to the   resistance to authoritarianism? And what makes of their creations a work   of love, a work that questions the logic of liberal and neo-liberal   political economies, and becomes a tool for social, political and   cultural change? Using case studies drawn from literature, art, popular   culture, film and media, the course will focus on key moments of Latin   American history and their present legacy. Topics will include Mexican   muralism, avant-garde movements and contemporary anti-neoliberal social   movements (Sergei Eisenstein, Frida Kahlo, Tina Modotti, Juan Rulfo,   EZLN); the artistic and political link between revolutionary Cuba and   the Soviet Union as reflected in cinema, diaries of war and poetry   (Mikhail Kalatozov, Alberto Korda, Ernesto Guevara, Reina Mar\u00eda   Rodr\u00edguez); the counterculture of the sixties in Brazil in music and   cinema (Maria Beth\u00e2nia, Glauber Rocha); the work of political mourning   and cultural resistance carried out in Chile by Pedro Lemebel and   Patricio Guzm\u00e1n. The program includes theoretical readings on the   politics of love (eros, agape, familial love and friendship) by Plato,   S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Luce Irigaray and Alain Badiou, among others. All the   readings will be in English; students may chose to do coursework in   English, Spanish or Portuguese. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002.  U.S. Latin@s in the Age of Social Media AHSEM-UA 231 (class # 17804) Instructor: T. Urayo\u00e1n Noel Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. This seminar examines twenty-first century U.S. Latina/o culture and identity through the lens of social media. The rise of Latin@s as a demographic and political force over the past fifteen years coincides with the rise of social networks, and the Internet has been a crucial yet underexamined space for the negotiation of contemporary Latinidad. In this course we will explore how artists, activists, governments, and corporations are using social media to reshape Latina/o identity from above and from below. While engaging with various social networking sites (including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram), we will also consider a range of related phenomena: internet memes, data-mining and hacking, new-media activism around issues such as immigration and gentrification, the politics of hashtagging, social movements in the age of digital libertarianism, and the intersections between technology and race/gender/sexuality/class. Critical readings will consist of work in the emerging field of social media studies (e.g. Mandiberg's The Social Media Reader and Fuchs's Social Media: A Critical Introduction) as well as key texts in media, cultural, and Latina/o studies by authors such as Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Marshall McLuhan, Leah Lievrouw, Ian Bogost, Arlene D\u00e1vila, Jillian B\u00e1ez, and Cristina Beltr\u00e1n. We will also read one or more work of \u201celectronic literature\u201d (Hayles) by authors such as Salvador Plasencia, Josefina B\u00e1ez, and Andrew E. Colarusso, and we will reflect on the state of literature in the age of social media. Assignments may include a visual essay, a group blog, a mapping exercise, and a social-media project. (No background in media and digital studies is assumed or required). Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 952.001 .

Our mission is to prepare students   to be thought leaders and successful global citizens. We do this by   creating unique academic opportunities for student and faculty   engagement that emphasize research and scholarly communication. Part of   the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced Honors Seminars place   students in small classes with distinguished faculty to study topics   that have the potential to change how we think and how we work. As such,   they are ideal gateways for the intellectually stimulating discussions   we aim to foster. They challenge students and faculty to engage   intensively within and beyond their fields of study, and they inspire   intellectual responsibility towards the scholarly community and the   wider world. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science   launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic   principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to upper-level courses   (open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors). Distinguished professors   drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s   professional schools, and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural,   and governmental leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances,   the seminars are cross-listed with departments and students may count   the classes toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes   will count only as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have three   central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between   exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students intellectually   through honors-level work in critical thinking, writing, and conversing;   and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in and aptitude for conducting   independent research (e.g. a DURF grant or a Senior Honors Thesis). They   are designed to foster scholarly insight and debate and to nurture the   intellectual passions of students and faculty alike. We encourage you to   try one this year! G. Gabrielle Starr Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science Wendy Suzuki Director of College Honors Programs   Course Descriptions  The NYU Mediation Lab VI: Startups at the Frontiers of Knowledge Edition AHSEM-UA 176 (class # 8186) Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The NYU Mediation Lab is open to ALL disciplines in FAS and to everyone who wishes to put their majors to work in the world. In your other classes this fall, you\u2019ll learn what\u2019s already in those majors. Our goal in this Lab is to figure out what\u2019s not in them\u2014yet. We\u2019ll begin by mapping the frontiers of knowledge in our subject areas by sharing our own areas of expertise and then heading out into the city for field research at other universities, as well as other institutions, from think tanks to museums. Our goal is to identify opportunities for startups like the ones that gave birth to Silicon Valley. We\u2019ll then all chose one and work collaboratively to make it happen. Its fate will be in your hands, and, instead of just a letter grade from me, you\u2019ll end the term by presenting what you\u2019ve built to an invited audience. [Since we will prepare ourselves by learning from \u201cstartups\u201d in the past, the Lab will have the added bonus for English majors of fulfilling the pre-1800 requirement.] Origin of the Lab: MIT has its famous Media Lab (media.mit.edu) to ask \u201cthe questions not yet asked\u2013questions whose answers could radically improve the way people live, learn, work, and play.\u201d At NYU, we go beyond the \u201cmedia\u201d to \u201cmediations\u201d of every kind\u2014to every strategy for turning the present into a better future. Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252.001.  Clifford Siskin is the Henry W. and Alfred A. Berg Professor of English and American Literature and the Director of The Re:Enlightenment Project. His subject is the interrelations of literary, social, and technological change. Links between past and present inform all of his work, from his sequencing of the genres of subjectivity ( The Historicity of Romantic Discourse ) to his recovery of literature\u2019s role in the formation of the modern disciplines ( The Work of Writing ). He is also co-editor, with William Warner, of This Is Enlightenment , and a forthcoming monograph that asks when and how the central genre of Enlightenment became the thing that we now love to blame: the SYSTEM. Narrating Poverty in Brazilian Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 186 (class # 17787) Instructor: Marta Peixoto Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30\u20134:45 p.m. This course, CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH, examines literary works in various genres (novels, autobiography, short stories), and Brazilian films (Cinema Novo and after, including documentaries), that attempt to narrate the experience of poverty. We will discuss texts by Graciliano Ramos, Carolina Maria de Jesus, Clarice Lispector, Rubem Fonseca, and Patricia Melo and view films ( Barren Lives, The Scavengers, The Hour of the Star, Pixote, Bus 174, City of God, Babil\u00f4nia 2000 and Black Orpheus ), in light of key questions. How do these texts reflect on the nature of representation and on the investments of author and reader in images of deprivation? How do they present the connections of poverty with violence, stigmatization, and citizenship rights? How do they frame the ethical responsibilities of the writer or film-maker, as well as of readers and spectators? What are the patterns of consumption and circulation of these texts? Cross-listed with Portuguese as PORT-UA 704.001. Marta Peixoto is Associate Professor of Spanish and Portuguese. Her studies focus on Brazilian literature and culture, and she has written books and essays on the major 20th-century writers Machado de Assis, Jo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto and Clarice Lispector, as well as on other novelists and poets. Her work draws on gender theory and more recently on theories of affect. She has also published essays on Brazilian cinema, focusing on representations of urban crises, on the blurring of distinctions between documentary and fiction, and on lyric aspects of recent documentary films. Love and Politics in Latin America AHSEM-UA 218 (class # 20883) Instructor: Perla Masi Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m. This   course will explore the ways in which art, literature and activism   intersect with social and political power in modern and contemporary   Latin America. What is the peculiar relationship between poetic   practice, political action and love? How does the work of poets, visual   artists, filmmakers, photographers, and guerrilleros, testify to the   resistance to authoritarianism? And what makes of their creations a work   of love, a work that questions the logic of liberal and neo-liberal   political economies, and becomes a tool for social, political and   cultural change? Using case studies drawn from literature, art, popular   culture, film and media, the course will focus on key moments of Latin   American history and their present legacy. Topics will include Mexican   muralism, avant-garde movements and contemporary anti-neoliberal social   movements (Sergei Eisenstein, Frida Kahlo, Tina Modotti, Juan Rulfo,   EZLN); the artistic and political link between revolutionary Cuba and   the Soviet Union as reflected in cinema, diaries of war and poetry   (Mikhail Kalatozov, Alberto Korda, Ernesto Guevara, Reina Mar\u00eda   Rodr\u00edguez); the counterculture of the sixties in Brazil in music and   cinema (Maria Beth\u00e2nia, Glauber Rocha); the work of political mourning   and cultural resistance carried out in Chile by Pedro Lemebel and   Patricio Guzm\u00e1n. The program includes theoretical readings on the   politics of love (eros, agape, familial love and friendship) by Plato,   S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Luce Irigaray and Alain Badiou, among others. All the   readings will be in English; students may chose to do coursework in   English, Spanish or Portuguese. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 551.002.  U.S. Latin@s in the Age of Social Media AHSEM-UA 231 (class # 17804) Instructor: T. Urayo\u00e1n Noel Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m. This seminar examines twenty-first century U.S. Latina/o culture and identity through the lens of social media. The rise of Latin@s as a demographic and political force over the past fifteen years coincides with the rise of social networks, and the Internet has been a crucial yet underexamined space for the negotiation of contemporary Latinidad. In this course we will explore how artists, activists, governments, and corporations are using social media to reshape Latina/o identity from above and from below. While engaging with various social networking sites (including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram), we will also consider a range of related phenomena: internet memes, data-mining and hacking, new-media activism around issues such as immigration and gentrification, the politics of hashtagging, social movements in the age of digital libertarianism, and the intersections between technology and race/gender/sexuality/class. Critical readings will consist of work in the emerging field of social media studies (e.g. Mandiberg's The Social Media Reader and Fuchs's Social Media: A Critical Introduction) as well as key texts in media, cultural, and Latina/o studies by authors such as Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Marshall McLuhan, Leah Lievrouw, Ian Bogost, Arlene D\u00e1vila, Jillian B\u00e1ez, and Cristina Beltr\u00e1n. We will also read one or more work of \u201celectronic literature\u201d (Hayles) by authors such as Salvador Plasencia, Josefina B\u00e1ez, and Andrew E. Colarusso, and we will reflect on the state of literature in the age of social media. Assignments may include a visual essay, a group blog, a mapping exercise, and a social-media project. (No background in media and digital studies is assumed or required). Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 952.001 .
