Its goal is to record the experiences of a wide range of Irish Americans towards an understanding of the durability and elasticity of ethnic identity over time.    Nearly 300 interviews form this collection, capturing a cross section of memories from men and women whose life histories intersect with culture, education, religion, media, business, government and the professions, whether the individual is an immigrant or removed by several generations from Ireland. The project aims to enhance our knowledge and understanding of Irish American identity.    The Project Directors are Dr. Linda Dowling Almeida, Dr. Marion R. Casey, and Dr. Miriam A. Nyhan of the Glucksman Ireland House Faculty; additional interviewers include Dr. \u00ccde O'Carroll, Dr. Danielle Zach, and Virginia Ferris, M.A.    The digitally recorded oral histories are deposited in New York University\u2019s Division of Libraries as part of the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History Collection (AIA030) in the Archives of Irish America. They are open to researchers by appointment; for further information, please contact irishamerica.archives@nyu.edu.    To see a list of those whose voices have been recorded for the Oral History of Irish America Collection, click here .    Excerpts from the collection have been used to illuminate the Irish-American experience through a series of podcasts produced by project co-director Linda Dowling Almeida on topics ranging from immigration reform to 9/11. See: http://irelandhouse.fas.nyu.edu/page/podcast .    An undergraduate course designed to teach oral history interviewing and documentation skills is offered by Glucksman Ireland House in the Fall semester; for details see http://irelandhouse.fas.nyu.edu/page/ohp.teaching .                       &Aacute;ras Glucksman na h&Eacute;ireann                      Ollscoil Nua Eabhrac                  Glucksman Ireland House                  New York University                  One Washington Mews                  New York, NY 10003                  U.S.A.
