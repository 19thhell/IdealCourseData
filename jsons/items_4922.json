Indeed, the Tamiment Library's predecessor, the Rand School of Social Science (1906-56), was for many years largely supported by revenues from Camp Tamiment, whose governing and educational bodies, respectively the People's Educational Camp Society and the Tamiment Institute, were responsible for the 1963 donation of the former library of the Rand School to New York University, eventually renamed the Tamiment Library.

Camp Midvale, located in Ringwood, New Jersey, was one of 400 camps worldwide established by the Nature Friends whose U.S. branch had been founded in 1910 by German-American socialists and trade unionists.    The organization's goals were to preserve wildlife and to provide workers with affordable outdoor recreation. Camp Midvale's 150 acres, with a clubhouse and hiking trails, was purchased in 1930 and served as a hub for Nature Friends' activities on the East Coast. Nature Friends offered a political perspective, combining ecological \"nature love\" with progressive sympathies. \"Fascist convictions\" were outlawed in their by-laws. Hikers raised funds for such causes as the \"Scottsboro Boys\", the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born, the Committee to Release the Rosenbergs, and the civil rights movement.

In the late 1930's, returning Spanish Civil War veterans were given jobs and the opportunity for [physical] rehabilitation at Unity. During World War II, local residents joined with campers and staff to raise funds for the war effort. A vibrant cultural program attracted guests from more traditional resorts. Cold War harassment--including a 1955 investigation to uncover 'Communists' use of summer camps to indoctrinate and disaffect American youth...'-- and internal disputes over camp policy on such issues as 'white chauvinism' - with camp management often taking a position different from that of the Communist Party -- resulted in declining attendance. From 1958 to 1963, the children's camps Calumet and Webatuck operated on the site.\"    Robert Steck Papers [Camp Unity], 1917-1998, 7 linear ft.

Camp Midvale, located in Ringwood, New Jersey, was one of 400 camps worldwide established by the Nature Friends whose U.S. branch had been founded in 1910 by German-American socialists and trade unionists.    The organization's goals were to preserve wildlife and to provide workers with affordable outdoor recreation. Camp Midvale's 150 acres, with a clubhouse and hiking trails, was purchased in 1930 and served as a hub for Nature Friends' activities on the East Coast. Nature Friends offered a political perspective, combining ecological \"nature love\" with progressive sympathies. \"Fascist convictions\" were outlawed in their by-laws. Hikers raised funds for such causes as the \"Scottsboro Boys\", the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born, the Committee to Release the Rosenbergs, and the civil rights movement. Placed on the Attorney General's list of \"subversive organizations\" in 1947, Nature Friends saw its members severely harassed. Camp Midvale was given to the Ethical Culture Society in 1968 in hope that it would be preserved as an ecological retreat.    Camp Nitgedaiget (Beacon, N.Y.)

Camp Unity (Wingdale, N.Y.)    The Encyclopedia of the American Left describes Unity camp this way: \"In 1927, Unity, which called itself the 'first proletarian summer colony,' which would become the first interracial adult camp in the United States, purchased a permanent site in Wingdale, New York. In the late 1930's, returning Spanish Civil War veterans were given jobs and the opportunity for [physical] rehabilitation at Unity. During World War II, local residents joined with campers and staff to raise funds for the war effort. A vibrant cultural program attracted guests from more traditional resorts. Cold War harassment--including a 1955 investigation to uncover 'Communists' use of summer camps to indoctrinate and disaffect American youth...'-- and internal disputes over camp policy on such issues as 'white chauvinism' - with camp management often taking a position different from that of the Communist Party -- resulted in declining attendance. From 1958 to 1963, the children's camps Calumet and Webatuck operated on the site.\"    Robert Steck Papers [Camp Unity], 1917-1998, 7 linear ft.
