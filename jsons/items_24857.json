Below we list some of the current areas of research.  The choice of categories is somewhat arbitrary, as many faculty have  interests that cut across boundaries, and the fields continue to evolve.        We give a very brief overview of the research in each area; more  detailed information may be found on individual faculty webpages.           Physical Applied Mathematics    Scientific Computing    Computational and Mathematical Biology    Analysis and PDE    Algebraic Geometry    Geometry    Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory    Probability Theory         PHYSICAL APPLIED MATHEMATICS      A central theme at the Courant Institute is the study of physical  systems using advanced methods of applied mathematics. Currently,  areas of focus include fluid dynamics, plasma physics, statistical  mechanics, molecular dynamics and dynamical systems. The tradition  at the Institute is to investigate fundamental questions as well as  to solve problems with direct, real-world applications. In doing so,  the people looking into these questions build on the strong synergies  and fresh ideas that emerge in the frequent collaboration with  analysis and PDE specialists as well as experts in scientific  computing at the institute.            Fluid Dynamics :   Marsha Berger, Oliver B&uuml;hler, David Cai, Aleksandar Donev, Edwin Gerber, Jonathan Goodman,   David Holland, Miranda Holmes-Cerfon, Richard Kleeman, Andrew Majda, Michael O'Neil,   Olivier Pauluis, Charles Peskin, Leif Ristroph, Michael Shelley, K. Shafer Smith,   K.R. Sreenivasan, Esteban Tabak, Jun Zhang         Plasma Physics :   Harold Weitzner, Eliezer Hameiri, Antoine Cerfon         Statistical Mechanics :   Aleksandar Donev, Andrew Majda, Charles Newman, Eric Vanden-Eijnden,   Miranda Holmes-Cerfon, Daniel Stein         Molecular Dynamics :   Aleksandar Donev, Eric Vanden-Eijnden, Miranda Holmes-Cerfon         Dynamical Systems :   Lai-Sang Young           SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING      Courant faculty have interests in stochastic modeling in statistical  and quantum mechanics, nonlinear optimization, matrix analysis,  high-dimensional data analysis, and numerical solutions of the partial  differential equations that lie at the heart of fluid and solid  mechanics, plasma physics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. Central  to much of this work is the development of robust and efficient  algorithms. As these algorithms are applied to increasingly complex  problems, significant attention is being devoted to the design of  effective and supportable software.              Computational Physics :   Marsha Berger, Antoine Cerfon, Aleksandar Donev, Dimitris Giannakis, Jonathan Goodman,   Leslie Greengard, Michael O'Neil, Michael Shelley, Georg Stadler, Margaret Wright, Denis Zorin         Numerical Analysis :   Michael Overton, Aaditya Rangan, Nick Trefethen, Olof Widlund         Scattering Theory :   Yu Chen, Leslie Greengard           COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY      Biological applications of mathematics and computing at Courant include genome analysis, biomolecular structure and dynamics, systems biology, embryology, immunology, neuroscience, heart physiology, biofluid dynamics, and medical imaging. The students, researchers and faculty who work on these questions are pure and applied mathematicians and computer scientists working in close collaboration with biological and medical colleagues at NYU and elsewhere.            Computational Neuroscience:    David McLaughlin, Charles Peskin, Aaditya Rangan, John Rinzel, Daniel Tranchina         Computational Biology:    Leslie Greengard, Bhubaneswar Mishra, Alex Mogilner, Mehryar Mohri, Aaditya Rangan, Daniel Tranchina         Mathematical Biology:    David Cai, Alex Mogilner, Charles Newman, Jerome Percus, Charles Peskin               ANALYSIS AND PDE      Most, if not all, physical systems can be modeled by Partial Differential Equations (PDE): from continuum mechanics (including fluid mechanics and material science) to quantum mechanics or general relativity. The study of PDE has been a central research theme at the Courant Institute since its foundation. Themes are extremely varied, ranging from abstract questions (existence, uniqueness of solutions) to more concrete ones (qualitative or quantitative information on the behaviour of solutions, often in relation with simulations). The study of PDE has strong ties with analysis: methods from Fourier Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory are at the heart of PDE theory, and theory of PDEs often suggest fundamental questions in these domains.            Calculus of Variations :   Bob Kohn, Sylvia Serfaty         Elliptic and Parabolic Problems :   Fengbo Hang, Bob Kohn, Fang-Hua Lin, Nader Masmoudi, Sylvia Serfaty         Geometric Measure Theory :   Fang-Hua Lin         Harmonic Analysis :   Pierre Germain, Sinan Gunturk         Integrable Systems :   Percy Deift, Henry McKean         Mathematical Elasticity :   Bob Kohn         Mathematical Fluid Mechanics :   Pierre Germain, Jonathan Goodman, Nader Masmoudi, Jalal Shatah         Nonlinear Waves :   Pierre Germain, Nader Masmoudi, Jalal Shatah         Spectral Theory :   Percy Deift             ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY      The research focus of the Algebraic geometry group at Courant lies at the  interface of geometry, topology, and number theory. Of particular interest  are problems concerning the existence and distribution of rational points  and rational curves on higher-dimensional varieties, group actions and  hidden symmetries, as well as rationality, unirationality, and hyperbolicity  properties of algebraic varieties.            Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory :   Fedor Bogomolov, Fred Greenleaf, Yuri Tschinkel         Arithmetic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Yuri Tschinkel         Complex Algebraic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Sylvain Cappell, Yuri Tschinkel         Holomorphic Symplectic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Yuri Tschinkel         Number Theory :   Yuri Tschinkel             GEOMETRY      Geometry research at Courant blends differential and metric geometry with analysis and topology. The geometry group has strong ties with analysis and partial differential equations, as there are many PDE&#39;s and techniques of interest to both groups, such as  Einstein&#39;s equations, the minimal surface equation, calculus of variations, and geometric measure theory.            Symplectic Geometry :   Sylvain Cappell, Mikhael Gromov         Geometric Analysis :   Jeff Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, Fengbo Hang, Bruce Kleiner, Fang-Hua Lin, Robert Young         Geometric Group Theory :   Tim Austin, Mikhael Gromov, Bruce Kleiner, Assaf Naor, Robert Young         Metric Geometry :   Jeff Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, Bruce Kleiner, Assaf Naor, Robert Young         Geometric Topology :   Sylvain Cappell, Bruce Kleiner             DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND ERGODIC THEORY      The subject of dynamical systems is concerned with systems that evolve over time according to a well-defined rule, which could be either deterministic or probabilistic; examples of such systems arise in almost any field of science. Ergodic theory is a branch of dynamical systems concerned with measure preserving transformation of measure spaces, such as the dynamical systems associated with Hamiltonian mechanics. The theory of dynamical systems has applications in many areas of mathematics, including number theory, PDE, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.            Dynamical Systems :   Tim Austin, Yuri Bakhtin, Lai-Sang Young               PROBABILITY THEORY        In the 1960s, the Sloan foundation helped build up a probability group at the Courant Institute. Monroe Donsker and Raghu Varadhan joined the Institute, where the theory of probability has thrived ever since. Domains of interest range from stochastic processes to statistical physics (percolation, random matrices&hellip;), which has become more and more central in recent years. Probability theory has natural connections with a number of fields (computational methods, financial mathematics, mathematical physics, dynamical systems) since a great number of phenomena can be best modeled or understood by probabilistic means.

Below we list some of the current areas of research.  The choice of categories is somewhat arbitrary, as many faculty have  interests that cut across boundaries, and the fields continue to evolve.        We give a very brief overview of the research in each area; more  detailed information may be found on individual faculty webpages.           Physical Applied Mathematics    Scientific Computing    Computational and Mathematical Biology    Analysis and PDE    Algebraic Geometry    Geometry    Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory    Probability Theory         PHYSICAL APPLIED MATHEMATICS      A central theme at the Courant Institute is the study of physical  systems using advanced methods of applied mathematics. Currently,  areas of focus include fluid dynamics, plasma physics, statistical  mechanics, molecular dynamics and dynamical systems. The tradition  at the Institute is to investigate fundamental questions as well as  to solve problems with direct, real-world applications. In doing so,  the people looking into these questions build on the strong synergies  and fresh ideas that emerge in the frequent collaboration with  analysis and PDE specialists as well as experts in scientific  computing at the institute.            Fluid Dynamics :   Marsha Berger, Oliver B&uuml;hler, David Cai, Aleksandar Donev, Edwin Gerber, Jonathan Goodman,   David Holland, Miranda Holmes-Cerfon, Richard Kleeman, Andrew Majda, Michael O'Neil,   Olivier Pauluis, Charles Peskin, Leif Ristroph, Michael Shelley, K. Shafer Smith,   K.R. Sreenivasan, Esteban Tabak, Jun Zhang         Plasma Physics :   Harold Weitzner, Eliezer Hameiri, Antoine Cerfon         Statistical Mechanics :   Aleksandar Donev, Andrew Majda, Charles Newman, Eric Vanden-Eijnden,   Miranda Holmes-Cerfon, Daniel Stein         Molecular Dynamics :   Aleksandar Donev, Eric Vanden-Eijnden, Miranda Holmes-Cerfon         Dynamical Systems :   Lai-Sang Young           SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING      Courant faculty have interests in stochastic modeling in statistical  and quantum mechanics, nonlinear optimization, matrix analysis,  high-dimensional data analysis, and numerical solutions of the partial  differential equations that lie at the heart of fluid and solid  mechanics, plasma physics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. Central  to much of this work is the development of robust and efficient  algorithms. As these algorithms are applied to increasingly complex  problems, significant attention is being devoted to the design of  effective and supportable software.              Computational Physics :   Marsha Berger, Antoine Cerfon, Aleksandar Donev, Dimitris Giannakis, Jonathan Goodman,   Leslie Greengard, Michael O'Neil, Michael Shelley, Georg Stadler, Margaret Wright, Denis Zorin         Numerical Analysis :   Michael Overton, Aaditya Rangan, Nick Trefethen, Olof Widlund         Scattering Theory :   Yu Chen, Leslie Greengard           COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY      Biological applications of mathematics and computing at Courant include genome analysis, biomolecular structure and dynamics, systems biology, embryology, immunology, neuroscience, heart physiology, biofluid dynamics, and medical imaging. The students, researchers and faculty who work on these questions are pure and applied mathematicians and computer scientists working in close collaboration with biological and medical colleagues at NYU and elsewhere.            Computational Neuroscience:    David McLaughlin, Charles Peskin, Aaditya Rangan, John Rinzel, Daniel Tranchina         Computational Biology:    Leslie Greengard, Bhubaneswar Mishra, Alex Mogilner, Mehryar Mohri, Aaditya Rangan, Daniel Tranchina         Mathematical Biology:    David Cai, Alex Mogilner, Charles Newman, Jerome Percus, Charles Peskin               ANALYSIS AND PDE      Most, if not all, physical systems can be modeled by Partial Differential Equations (PDE): from continuum mechanics (including fluid mechanics and material science) to quantum mechanics or general relativity. The study of PDE has been a central research theme at the Courant Institute since its foundation. Themes are extremely varied, ranging from abstract questions (existence, uniqueness of solutions) to more concrete ones (qualitative or quantitative information on the behaviour of solutions, often in relation with simulations). The study of PDE has strong ties with analysis: methods from Fourier Analysis and Geometric Measure Theory are at the heart of PDE theory, and theory of PDEs often suggest fundamental questions in these domains.            Calculus of Variations :   Bob Kohn, Sylvia Serfaty         Elliptic and Parabolic Problems :   Fengbo Hang, Bob Kohn, Fang-Hua Lin, Nader Masmoudi, Sylvia Serfaty         Geometric Measure Theory :   Fang-Hua Lin         Harmonic Analysis :   Pierre Germain, Sinan Gunturk         Integrable Systems :   Percy Deift, Henry McKean         Mathematical Elasticity :   Bob Kohn         Mathematical Fluid Mechanics :   Pierre Germain, Jonathan Goodman, Nader Masmoudi, Jalal Shatah         Nonlinear Waves :   Pierre Germain, Nader Masmoudi, Jalal Shatah         Spectral Theory :   Percy Deift             ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY      The research focus of the Algebraic geometry group at Courant lies at the  interface of geometry, topology, and number theory. Of particular interest  are problems concerning the existence and distribution of rational points  and rational curves on higher-dimensional varieties, group actions and  hidden symmetries, as well as rationality, unirationality, and hyperbolicity  properties of algebraic varieties.            Algebraic Groups and Representation Theory :   Fedor Bogomolov, Fred Greenleaf, Yuri Tschinkel         Arithmetic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Yuri Tschinkel         Complex Algebraic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Sylvain Cappell, Yuri Tschinkel         Holomorphic Symplectic Geometry :   Fedor Bogomolov, Yuri Tschinkel         Number Theory :   Yuri Tschinkel             GEOMETRY      Geometry research at Courant blends differential and metric geometry with analysis and topology. The geometry group has strong ties with analysis and partial differential equations, as there are many PDE&#39;s and techniques of interest to both groups, such as  Einstein&#39;s equations, the minimal surface equation, calculus of variations, and geometric measure theory.            Symplectic Geometry :   Sylvain Cappell, Mikhael Gromov         Geometric Analysis :   Jeff Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, Fengbo Hang, Bruce Kleiner, Fang-Hua Lin, Robert Young         Geometric Group Theory :   Tim Austin, Mikhael Gromov, Bruce Kleiner, Assaf Naor, Robert Young         Metric Geometry :   Jeff Cheeger, Mikhael Gromov, Bruce Kleiner, Assaf Naor, Robert Young         Geometric Topology :   Sylvain Cappell, Bruce Kleiner             DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND ERGODIC THEORY      The subject of dynamical systems is concerned with systems that evolve over time according to a well-defined rule, which could be either deterministic or probabilistic; examples of such systems arise in almost any field of science. Ergodic theory is a branch of dynamical systems concerned with measure preserving transformation of measure spaces, such as the dynamical systems associated with Hamiltonian mechanics. The theory of dynamical systems has applications in many areas of mathematics, including number theory, PDE, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.            Dynamical Systems :   Tim Austin, Yuri Bakhtin, Lai-Sang Young               PROBABILITY THEORY        In the 1960s, the Sloan foundation helped build up a probability group at the Courant Institute. Monroe Donsker and Raghu Varadhan joined the Institute, where the theory of probability has thrived ever since. Domains of interest range from stochastic processes to statistical physics (percolation, random matrices&hellip;), which has become more and more central in recent years. Probability theory has natural connections with a number of fields (computational methods, financial mathematics, mathematical physics, dynamical systems) since a great number of phenomena can be best modeled or understood by probabilistic means.            Probability Theory :   Yuri Bakhtin, Gerard Ben Arous, Paul Bourgade, Eyal Lubetzky,   Charles Newman, S. R.
