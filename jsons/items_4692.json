They are advanced seminars for juniors and seniors who are politics majors. To take any undergraduate field seminar, students must first have completed four courses in politics, one of which must be the core in that subfield. They must also have a 3.0 cumulative GPA or the permission of the instructor. Enrollment is limited.     Analytical Politics Quantitative Methods in Political Science POL-UA 800 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to the use of quantitative methods in the study of politics. Begins with a brief review of the basic elements of scientific thinking and their application to the social sciences. Next, students are introduced to probability theory and statistics with a view to testing hypotheses about politics. Students learn to use statistical software to organize and analyze data. Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions POL-UA 810 Offered every year. 4 points. Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. The tools of economic theory, game theory, and social choice theory are applied to the rational choice analysis of political institutions, whose consequences for society are derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. Introduction to Political Psychology POL-UA 812 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. It introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. Introduction to Game Theory in Political Science POL-UA 840 Offered every year. 4 points. Game theory is a mathematical tool used to study strategic interactions. Whenever the choices made by two or more distinct decision makers have an effect on the others' outcomes, the interaction between them is game-theoretic in nature. As suggested by its recent emergence into popular culture, game theory has been applied widely, in attempts to address phenomena in a variety of academic disciplines, including political science, economics, and biology. Because much of politics is about allocation of scarce goods, such as power and wealth, and the competition for these goods, much of politics would seem to be a natural fit for the language of game theory. Doing Political Economy: Approaches to Public Policy POL-UA 842 Offered every semester. 4 points. Political economy is a field of inquiry that has made great strides in recent years in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. Games, Strategy, and Politics POL-UA 844 Offered every year. 4 points. Theories of political strategy with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and negotiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strategies and the uses of power, with some applications outside political science. Social Choice and Politics POL-UA 845 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals' voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions. The emphasis is analytical, though students are not expected to have a background in formal mathematics. Experimental Methods in Political Science POL-UA 846 Prerequisites: Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Designed to provide an introduction to experimental methods in political science. Emphasizes several different styles of laboratory experiments, but field experiments (and briefly, survey experiments) are also discussed. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Analytical Politics POL-UA 895 Prerequisites: cumulative GPA of 3.0 and four previous courses in politics or permission of the instructor. Offered every year. 4 points. Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in analytical politics. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.     Political Theory Political Theory (Core course) POL-UA 100 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to some outstanding theories of politics. The theories treated offer alternative conceptions of political life, and they are examined from both theoretical and historical perspectives. Among the theorists included are Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, and Marx. Topics in Premodern Political Philosophy POL-UA 110 Formerly Political Thought from Plato to Machiavelli. Identical to MEDI-UA 110. Offered every other year. 4 points. Intensive introduction to the major themes of Western political thought. Topics in Modern Political Thought: 1500 to the Present POL-UA 120 Offered every year. 4 points. Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy POL-UA 130 Offered once a year. 4 points. Students systematically evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts of normative political theory. In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to do bad in order to do good? In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it that we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Substantive policy topics vary from semester to semester. Theories of Justice POL-UA 138 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to help students think more rigorously about questions of justice by examining the strengths and weaknesses of competing contemporary theories of justice. We survey a range of influential approaches to understanding justice, including those advocated by libertarians, utilitarians, egalitarians, feminists, communitarians, and Marxists. This course should help students to (1) recognize that political convictions rest on underlying moral assumptions; (2) learn how to interrogate, challenge, and defend these assumptions; and (3) gain some appreciation of how these issues have been addressed by major figures in contemporary political theory. Socialist Theory POL-UA 140 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Concentrates on those socialist schools\u2014Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism\u2014that have proved to be the most successful. Presents their major theories and examines the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live. Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict POL-UA 150 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Seeks to explain the varied forms of nationalism and extremism. To that end, we bring various psychological, economic, anthropological, and sociological theories to bear on the origins and development of nationalist movements. We attempt to understand the historical phases of nationalist development, from the early cases of Great Britain and the United States, through the later cases of Europe and Latin America, the anticolonial cases of Africa and much of Asia, and, finally, the often religiously-based movements of the present era. We also read some of the normative literature that has tried to justify nationalism, both in the abstract and in particular cases. Democracy and Dictatorship POL-UA 160 Offered every other year. 4 points. Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship. American Political Thought POL-UA 170 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present. Topics include Puritanism, revolution and independence, the framing of the Constitution, Hamiltonian nationalism, Jeffersonian republicanism, Jacksonian democracy, pro-slavery and antislavery thought, Civil War and Reconstruction, social Darwinism and laissez-faire, the reformist thought of populism, progressivism and socialism, legal realism, the New Deal and 20th-century liberalism, modern conservatism, civil rights, and war protest. Readings and discussion are based on original and interpretative sources. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Political Theory POL-UA 195 Prerequisites: Political Theory (POL-UA 100) and three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.0 GPA, or permission of the instructor. Offered every semester. 4 points. Advanced seminar for juniors and seniors in political theory. The specific topic of the seminar is announced each year.      American Government and Politics Power and Politics in America (Core course) POL-UA 300 Offered every semester. 4 points. A survey of national political institutions and behavior in the United States, which introduces students to a variety of analytical concepts and approaches useful for the study of domestic politics. Concepts typically covered include public goods and collective action; preference aggregation and the median voter theorem; delegation, representation, and accountability; agenda control; interbranch bargaining; and the mechanisms of private influence on public policy. Public Policy POL-UA 306 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered in the fall. 4 points. Introduction to public policymaking in American federal government. The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. The course examines the way the agenda is set and issues are processed in Washington. Covers Congress, the bureaucracy, program implementation, policy analysis, and budgeting. Students do a special project on an important current issue. In recent years, these issues have included Social Security reform, Medicare, and illegal immigration. The Presidency POL-UA 310 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of the American presidency, its origins, and roles, including those of commander-in-chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice. The president is also viewed as a decision maker and compared with the heads of other governments. Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies. The Biology of Politics POL-UA 311 Offered every year. 4 points. Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? When are we most likely to participate? Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, motivation, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. Recently, however, scholars have begun to explore the possibility that genetic differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political participation. Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence POL-UA 315 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Uses logic and evidence to analyze issues of public policy. Applies sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, as seen in the film Moneyball) to such vastly more important topics as improving schools, designing health policy, and dealing with climate change. Congress and Legislative Assemblies POL-UA 320 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States. Although some attention is given to state legislatures and municipal lawmaking bodies, the major emphasis is on the Congress. Readings include a textbook, official sources such as the Congressional Record and Congressional District Data Book, and new behavioral studies and commentaries. The American Constitution POL-UA 330 Offered every semester. 4 points. Interpretation of the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Distribution of constitutional power among Congress, the president, and the federal courts; between the national government and the states; and among the states. Constitutional law and American political and economic development. Cases are read and discussed closely for their legal and philosophical content. Civil Liberties POL-UA 332 Offered every semester. 4 points. Interpretation of the Bill of Rights, the Civil War amendments, and other rights in the U.S. Constitution through the reading of Supreme Court opinions. Topics include freedom of speech and press; free exercise of religion and separation of church and state; the right of privacy; rights of the criminally accused; equal protection of the law against race, gender, and other discrimination; and the rights of franchise and citizenship. Cases are read and discussed closely for their legal and philosophical content. The United States Supreme Court POL-UA 333 Prerequisite: The American Constitution (POL-UA 330) or Civil Liberties (POL-UA 332). Offered every other year. 4 points. Institutional examination of the third branch of government as chief interpreter of the Constitution and reviewer of the work of government. Considers the structure, procedures, personnel, and informal organization of the court, along with the appointment process. Gives some attention to the impact of the court's decisions and to public opinion about the court. Emphasis on the court's political role in a democratic polity. American Law and Legal System POL-UA 334 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduction to law and the legal system through the reading of actual cases. Topics include the adjudication of conflict, the structure and functions of trial and appellate courts, civil and criminal procedure, judicial remedies, judicial decision making, and the limits of judicial relief. Uses tort, contract, property, divorce, and other law for illustration. Law and Society POL-UA 335 Identical to LWSOC-UA 1, SCA-UA 722. Offered every other year. 4 points. Critically examines the relationship between law and political and social movements such as the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and the labor and environmental movements. Emphasis on law as a political process, legal remedies for racial and gender discrimination, and class-action torts. Deals with the politics of rights and the limits and possibilities of law as a process for social change. Gender in Law POL-UA 336 Identical to SCA-UA 723. Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, the course also addresses to what extent understandings of gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, the course considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. The Rule of Law POL-UA 337 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology. This course explores the theory surrounding the rule of law ideal. It focuses on the political conditions that promote the rule of law as well as on the challenges to the rule of law in times of emergencies. Topics include the connection between law and morality, the political foundation of the rule of law, the interaction among political institutions in promoting or subverting the rule of law, the rule of law in times of crisis, the effects of emergency powers on the rule of law, and the rule of law and terrorism prevention.

Private Influence in Public Policy POL-UA 341 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. In this course, we will examine the role of private influence in public policy from a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives. Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, and the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the overcoming the challenges associated with demonstrating influence empirically. American Public Opinion POL-UA 342 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Covers two areas of great importance to American democratic society. One area deals with the attempts made to define, identify, survey, analyze, and evaluate the influence of what is referred to as public opinion. The other concerns how citizens unite in interest groups to influence or pressure government. Role and methods of interest groups in American society and their relationship to political parties, elected and appointed officeholders, and the democratic process. A study of who governs in the United States. The Election Process POL-UA 344 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Provides an understanding of election processes in the United States through different theoretical approaches to the study of campaigns and elections and the testing of empirical hypotheses. Analyzes campaign strategies of political candidates, the use of polls and media in campaigns, and the effects of issues and personalities on election outcomes. Evaluates the role of presidential primaries and elections in the functioning of a democracy. Bureaucracy and Public Policy POL-UA 350 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. We examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas. The Politics of Administrative Law POL-UA 354 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines legal, political, and economic issues in government regulation. Covers such classic debates and issues as the historical origins of regulation, the legal philosophy of administrative regulation, the relationship between courts and agencies, the political and social conflicts surrounding regulatory politics, and the role of law in state formation. Urban Government and Politics POL-UA 360 Identical to SCA-UA 753. Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points.

Particular emphasis is placed on the United States. International comparisons are also present. The course assumes that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory is provided. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange. Honors Seminar: Courts, Rights, and Politics POL-UA 396 Prerequisites: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.5 GPA. Offered every year. 4 points. When we look at the protection of civil rights and liberties in the United States, we typically restrict our attention to prominent cases decided by the Supreme Court. We do so on the theory that rights and liberties are generally abused by legislative majorities, and protected by independent courts. But many important rights and liberties in the U.S. have been protected by legislative majorities, not by the federal courts. The federal courts have in fact blocked many efforts by legislatures to protect rights and liberties. Using a variety of materials, this seminar reexamines the premise that rights are best protected by independent courts. We look at the record of rights protections both in the United States and more globally. We read court cases, historical accounts, works of political theory, and statistical analyses. We also collect our own data and conduct analyses of that data. U.S. Foreign Policy POL-UA 710 Offered every year. 4 points. See \"International Politics,\" below.

The U.S. elections are used as the frame of reference for examining the effect of institutions and voting behavior. Other countries are discussed to illustrate how cross-national differences in voting behavior and institutions can affect the electoral processes. This comparative perspective provides a better way to understand the U.S. electoral process. Western European Politics POL-UA 510 Identical to EURO-UA 510.

We then analyze the impact of this transformation on attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and then to incorporate immigrants into the national community.

The budding new field of Network Analysis offers the tools to answer questions like these. Network analysis is a recent import into the social sciences, and has been developed in a diverse set of fields, from physics to computer science to sociology. Recognizing that objects of study (people, genes, web pages, virus hosts, etc.) are often influenced by \u2018neighboring\u2019 objects of study, these fields have created a paradigm and a set of tools that political scientists can use to study segregation, the spread of ideas, learning, institutional design, the adoption of new technologies, epidemics, migration, trade, revolutions, and various other phenomena that involve a group of people interacting.

They are advanced seminars for juniors and seniors who are politics majors. To take any undergraduate field seminar, students must first have completed four courses in politics, one of which must be the core in that subfield. They must also have a 3.0 cumulative GPA or the permission of the instructor. Enrollment is limited.     Analytical Politics Quantitative Methods in Political Science POL-UA 800 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to the use of quantitative methods in the study of politics. Begins with a brief review of the basic elements of scientific thinking and their application to the social sciences. Next, students are introduced to probability theory and statistics with a view to testing hypotheses about politics. Students learn to use statistical software to organize and analyze data. Political Engineering: The Design of Institutions POL-UA 810 Offered every year. 4 points. Institutions are the rules by which societies govern themselves. The tools of economic theory, game theory, and social choice theory are applied to the rational choice analysis of political institutions, whose consequences for society are derived from assumptions about what individuals seek to maximize. Introduction to Political Psychology POL-UA 812 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a broad overview of political psychology, a field that uses experimental methods and theoretical ideas from psychology as tools to help understand political processes. It introduces important concepts from psychology, offering new ways of thinking about subjects as varied as personality, the dynamics of social groups, and the ways in which emotion affects decision making, and then applies these concepts to various topics within political science, including the media and political advertising, race relations, the legitimacy of government institutions, and the formation of opinions and ideologies. In addition, by describing political psychology experimentation in detail, the course teaches about how the scientific method can be applied to the study of politics. Introduction to Game Theory in Political Science POL-UA 840 Offered every year. 4 points. Game theory is a mathematical tool used to study strategic interactions. Whenever the choices made by two or more distinct decision makers have an effect on the others' outcomes, the interaction between them is game-theoretic in nature. As suggested by its recent emergence into popular culture, game theory has been applied widely, in attempts to address phenomena in a variety of academic disciplines, including political science, economics, and biology. Because much of politics is about allocation of scarce goods, such as power and wealth, and the competition for these goods, much of politics would seem to be a natural fit for the language of game theory. Doing Political Economy: Approaches to Public Policy POL-UA 842 Offered every semester. 4 points. Political economy is a field of inquiry that has made great strides in recent years in explaining political and economic behavior by characterizing the incentives of actors and the context in which these actors make decisions and influence outcomes. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to these theoretical approaches and show how they can be used to address contemporary policy questions. Games, Strategy, and Politics POL-UA 844 Offered every year. 4 points. Theories of political strategy with emphasis on the theory of games. Uses of strategy in defense and deterrence policies of nations, guerrilla warfare of revolutionaries and terrorists, bargaining and negotiation processes, coalitions and the enforcement of collective action, and voting in committees and elections. Secrecy and deception as political strategies and the uses of power, with some applications outside political science. Social Choice and Politics POL-UA 845 Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to social choice theory applied to political science. It focuses on (1) individual choice, (2) group choice, (3) collective action, and (4) institutions. It looks at models of individuals' voting behavior, the incentive structures of interest groups, and the role of institutions. The emphasis is analytical, though students are not expected to have a background in formal mathematics. Experimental Methods in Political Science POL-UA 846 Prerequisites: Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Designed to provide an introduction to experimental methods in political science.

Political Theory Political Theory (Core course) POL-UA 100 Offered every semester. 4 points. Introduces students to some outstanding theories of politics. The theories treated offer alternative conceptions of political life, and they are examined from both theoretical and historical perspectives. Among the theorists included are Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Mill, and Marx. Topics in Premodern Political Philosophy POL-UA 110 Formerly Political Thought from Plato to Machiavelli. Identical to MEDI-UA 110. Offered every other year. 4 points.

Examines the development of political thought from Machiavelli to Nietzsche through a careful study of primary works. Authors include Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy POL-UA 130 Offered once a year. 4 points. Students systematically evaluate ethically controversial public policy issues using concepts of normative political theory. In the first half of the course, we consider the means by which policy is implemented: Under what conditions, if any, might we permit political actors to do bad in order to do good? In the second half, we consider the ends of public policy: What is it that we want the state to accomplish, and at what cost? Substantive policy topics vary from semester to semester. Theories of Justice POL-UA 138 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Aims to help students think more rigorously about questions of justice by examining the strengths and weaknesses of competing contemporary theories of justice. We survey a range of influential approaches to understanding justice, including those advocated by libertarians, utilitarians, egalitarians, feminists, communitarians, and Marxists. This course should help students to (1) recognize that political convictions rest on underlying moral assumptions; (2) learn how to interrogate, challenge, and defend these assumptions; and (3) gain some appreciation of how these issues have been addressed by major figures in contemporary political theory. Socialist Theory POL-UA 140 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Concentrates on those socialist schools\u2014Christian socialism, utopian socialism, Marxism, Fabianism, and anarchism\u2014that have proved to be the most successful. Presents their major theories and examines the usefulness of such theories in helping us to understand and, in some cases, alter the world in which we live. Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict POL-UA 150 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Seeks to explain the varied forms of nationalism and extremism. To that end, we bring various psychological, economic, anthropological, and sociological theories to bear on the origins and development of nationalist movements. We attempt to understand the historical phases of nationalist development, from the early cases of Great Britain and the United States, through the later cases of Europe and Latin America, the anticolonial cases of Africa and much of Asia, and, finally, the often religiously-based movements of the present era. We also read some of the normative literature that has tried to justify nationalism, both in the abstract and in particular cases. Democracy and Dictatorship POL-UA 160 Offered every other year. 4 points. Democracy and dictatorships have traditionally been analyzed in terms of their apparently different institutional characteristics and legal foundations. Examines these traditional interpretations but leans heavily toward ideological and contextual factors. Challenges traditional distinctions between democracy and dictatorship. American Political Thought POL-UA 170 Prerequisite: Political Theory (POL-UA 100). Offered every year. 4 points. Study of American political ideas and debate from colonial times to the present. Topics include Puritanism, revolution and independence, the framing of the Constitution, Hamiltonian nationalism, Jeffersonian republicanism, Jacksonian democracy, pro-slavery and antislavery thought, Civil War and Reconstruction, social Darwinism and laissez-faire, the reformist thought of populism, progressivism and socialism, legal realism, the New Deal and 20th-century liberalism, modern conservatism, civil rights, and war protest. Readings and discussion are based on original and interpretative sources. Undergraduate Field Seminar: Political Theory POL-UA 195 Prerequisites: Political Theory (POL-UA 100) and three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.0 GPA, or permission of the instructor.

American Government and Politics Power and Politics in America (Core course) POL-UA 300 Offered every semester. 4 points. A survey of national political institutions and behavior in the United States, which introduces students to a variety of analytical concepts and approaches useful for the study of domestic politics. Concepts typically covered include public goods and collective action; preference aggregation and the median voter theorem; delegation, representation, and accountability; agenda control; interbranch bargaining; and the mechanisms of private influence on public policy. Public Policy POL-UA 306 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered in the fall. 4 points. Introduction to public policymaking in American federal government. The issues politicians address at election time often have little to do with what they actually do in office. The course examines the way the agenda is set and issues are processed in Washington. Covers Congress, the bureaucracy, program implementation, policy analysis, and budgeting. Students do a special project on an important current issue. In recent years, these issues have included Social Security reform, Medicare, and illegal immigration. The Presidency POL-UA 310 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of the American presidency, its origins, and roles, including those of commander-in-chief; director of foreign policy; leader in legislation, administration, and party affairs; manager of the economy; and dispenser of social justice. The president is also viewed as a decision maker and compared with the heads of other governments. Readings include the works of presidents and their associates, analytical commentaries by observers of the presidency, and biographies. The Biology of Politics POL-UA 311 Offered every year. 4 points. Why do we participate in politics? Who tends to participate? When are we most likely to participate? Political scientists have traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, motivation, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer these questions. Recently, however, scholars have begun to explore the possibility that genetic differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political participation. Controversies in Public Policy: Logic and Evidence POL-UA 315 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Uses logic and evidence to analyze issues of public policy. Applies sabermetrics (logic and evidence applied to baseball, as seen in the film Moneyball) to such vastly more important topics as improving schools, designing health policy, and dealing with climate change. Congress and Legislative Assemblies POL-UA 320 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Origin, structure, functions, and dynamics of legislatures in the United States. Although some attention is given to state legislatures and municipal lawmaking bodies, the major emphasis is on the Congress.

Uses tort, contract, property, divorce, and other law for illustration. Law and Society POL-UA 335 Identical to LWSOC-UA 1, SCA-UA 722. Offered every other year. 4 points. Critically examines the relationship between law and political and social movements such as the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and the labor and environmental movements. Emphasis on law as a political process, legal remedies for racial and gender discrimination, and class-action torts. Deals with the politics of rights and the limits and possibilities of law as a process for social change. Gender in Law POL-UA 336 Identical to SCA-UA 723. Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines the relationship between gender politics, legal theory, and social policy. Studies the role that the legal arena and certain historical conditions have played in creating, revising, and protecting particular gender identities and not others and examines the political effects of those legal constructions. Analyzes the major debates in feminist legal theory, including theories of equality, the problem of essentialism, and the relevance of standpoint epistemology. In addition to examining how the law understands sex discrimination in the workplace and the feminization of the legal profession, the course also addresses to what extent understandings of gender affect how law regulates the physical body by looking at the regulation of reproduction and of consensual sexual activity. In light of all of the above, the course considers to what extent law is or is not an effective political resource in reforming notions of gender in law and society. The Rule of Law POL-UA 337 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every year. 4 points. The rule of law requires that people in positions of authority should exercise their power within a constraining framework of public laws rather than on the basis of their own preferences or their own ideology.

Course topics will include in-depth analysis of mechanisms of influence (e.g., selection of sympathetic incumbents, the provision of incentives for public officials, and the provision of information), objects of influence (voter choices, legislative behavior, bureaucratic decisions), collective action, and organizational maintenance. Special attention will be paid to the overcoming the challenges associated with demonstrating influence empirically. American Public Opinion POL-UA 342 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300). Offered every other year. 4 points. Covers two areas of great importance to American democratic society.

Offered every year. 4 points. Bureaucracies are inescapably embedded in the American political environment, and political conflicts within administrative agencies are ubiquitous. We examine the major questions political scientists ask about public bureaucracies: How have they evolved to their current form? Why do bureaucrats engage in behavior that many of us consider pathological or arbitrary? How can unelected government officials be made more accountable to their elected counterparts and to citizens? In addressing these questions and others, we draw on cases of government in action in a number of different public policy areas. The Politics of Administrative Law POL-UA 354 Offered every other year. 4 points. Examines legal, political, and economic issues in government regulation. Covers such classic debates and issues as the historical origins of regulation, the legal philosophy of administrative regulation, the relationship between courts and agencies, the political and social conflicts surrounding regulatory politics, and the role of law in state formation.

Study of politics and politicians in the contemporary American city. Evolution of local party organizations, the rise and fall of party \"bosses,\" and the predicament of the ordinary citizen in the urban community. Patterns of city politics against the background of American social and cultural history, including the impulse toward reform and the effects of reform efforts on the distribution of power in the community. Conceptions of effective leadership in urban politics and the role of the police, the press, and \"good government\" groups in local political life.

Honors Seminar: Politics and Finance POL-UA 396 Prerequisites: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), three other politics courses, one course in economics, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.5 GPA. Offered every year. 4 points. Examines how legislation and regulation influence the structure of financial markets and how players in these markets intervene in the political process to create or modify legislative and regulatory outcomes. Particular emphasis is placed on the United States. International comparisons are also present. The course assumes that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory is provided. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange. Honors Seminar: Courts, Rights, and Politics POL-UA 396 Prerequisites: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), three other politics courses, junior or senior standing, and a minimum 3.5 GPA. Offered every year. 4 points. When we look at the protection of civil rights and liberties in the United States, we typically restrict our attention to prominent cases decided by the Supreme Court. We do so on the theory that rights and liberties are generally abused by legislative majorities, and protected by independent courts. But many important rights and liberties in the U.S. have been protected by legislative majorities, not by the federal courts. The federal courts have in fact blocked many efforts by legislatures to protect rights and liberties. Using a variety of materials, this seminar reexamines the premise that rights are best protected by independent courts. We look at the record of rights protections both in the United States and more globally. We read court cases, historical accounts, works of political theory, and statistical analyses. We also collect our own data and conduct analyses of that data. U.S. Foreign Policy POL-UA 710 Offered every year. 4 points. See \"International Politics,\" below.

Elections and Voting POL-UA 505 Prerequisite: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300) or Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500). Offered every year. 4 points. Examines how and why elections differ so much across democracies. Is it because voters are different in these countries? Or is it because the electoral laws differ across countries? The U.S. elections are used as the frame of reference for examining the effect of institutions and voting behavior. Other countries are discussed to illustrate how cross-national differences in voting behavior and institutions can affect the electoral processes. This comparative perspective provides a better way to understand the U.S. electoral process. Western European Politics POL-UA 510 Identical to EURO-UA 510. Prerequisite: Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500). Offered every year. 4 points. Study of the politics of Britain, Ireland, France, and Germany.

Explores immigration and patterns of immigrant incorporation in Western Europe in comparative perspective. Since the early 1960s, immigration has transformed European countries into multiracial and multiethnic societies. We first explore how public policy contributed to this transformation; how it was structured by different concepts, traditions, and laws on citizenship; and how it was related to transformation of the party system and the emergence of the extreme right and \"identity politics\" in Western Europe. We then analyze the impact of this transformation on attempts by European states first to maintain control of their frontiers, and then to incorporate immigrants into the national community. Finally, we explore the emerging movement within the European Union to develop harmonized policies for asylum seekers and immigration at a time of growing pressures for increased immigration in Western Europe.

Contemporary African Politics POL-UA 584 Prerequisite: Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500). Offered every year. Scacco. 4 points. Offers an introduction to contemporary African politics. Our goal is to introduce students to the most pressing problems African countries have faced since independence. Questions motivating the course include: (1) Why are state institutions weaker in Africa than in other developing regions? (2) What explains Africa's slow economic growth? (3) What can be done to improve political accountability on the continent? (4) Why have some African countries been plagued by high levels of political violence while others have not? (5) Can or should the West attempt to \"save\" Africa? As we address the core themes of the course, we draw on a wide range of academic disciplines, including political science, history, economics, and anthropology.

The budding new field of Network Analysis offers the tools to answer questions like these. Network analysis is a recent import into the social sciences, and has been developed in a diverse set of fields, from physics to computer science to sociology. Recognizing that objects of study (people, genes, web pages, virus hosts, etc.) are often influenced by \u2018neighboring\u2019 objects of study, these fields have created a paradigm and a set of tools that political scientists can use to study segregation, the spread of ideas, learning, institutional design, the adoption of new technologies, epidemics, migration, trade, revolutions, and various other phenomena that involve a group of people interacting.

   Economics is the study of human decision-making, considered in relation to the economic tasks of life. It looks at how individuals within larger social groups, including communities, organizations, markets, and economies, make decisions about how much to work and play, spend and save. Economic analyses also consider how the economic decisions made by one group of people affect the decisions made by others. They then study how the aggregated effects of these decisions impact production, distribution, trade, and the consumption of goods and services across local regions, countries, and the world.   The Economics curriculum at NYU Abu Dhabi is designed to introduce students to these fundamental dynamics of human life and, in doing so, is grounded in three basic pedagogical principles:     Undergraduate students must be exposed to the \u201cbig ideas\u201d and pressing social issues of our world and given economic frameworks for thinking about them.   Meaningful study of economics requires being able to think about problems from local, regional, and global perspectives.   Effective economic reasoning increasingly involves a multi- disciplinary approach combining the best economic thinking with the best thinking in psychology, history, and politics.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions.

We study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers&mdash;firms and consumers&mdash;and coordinates their behavior. We will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes. Students pursuing a specialization in theory must take Advanced Microeconomics (ECON-AD 305), in addition to Intermediate Microeconomics.    *Prerequisites: Principles of Microeconomics (ECON-AD 101), (Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111)) and MATH-AD 112    *Students in the NYUNY Economics Dept: This course is equivalent to ECON-UA 10 Intermediate Microeconomics                                                                          Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 8:15-9:30                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                  Bernard Caillaud, Andrew Schotter                                          -             MTR, 9:55-11:10                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2012 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 10:10-11:25                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:00-2:15 PM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 1:10-2:25 PM (Section II)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 1 2014 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                  Ennio Stacchetti                                          -             MW, 1:00-3:40 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Kevin Thom                                           -             TR, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             MW, 3:35 - 4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 3:35-4:50 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Herv\u00e9 Cr\u00e8s                                           -             TR, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

We place the crisis in historical context of the Great Depression and of the emerging market financial crises such as those that occurred in Latin American and East Asia. We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market. The policy responses are analyzed within the context of the political-economic environment.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation?

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ECON-AD 221 Understanding Financial Crises                                             The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and some related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a long run perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises), and will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, putting the emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once the foundations are in place, the course will open up to a series of topics mixing themes &ndash; such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms &ndash; and in-depth study of major crises episodes &ndash; such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007-2008 and the Euro Crisis.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

The course starts with a careful study of the functioning of markets, culminating with the first and second theorem of welfare economics. The next topics cover an introduction to strategic behavior and game theory, and subsequently a study of market failures situations in the case of adverse selection and moral hazard. This course involves more formal analysis than the one used in Intermediate Microeconomics.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

It emphasizes accounting as the process through which relevant financial information concerning an economic entity is recorded and communicated to different parties, such as stockholders, creditors, tax authorities, investors, etc. The underlying rationale of accounting principles is discussed, aiming to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. In this course students learn about the relevance and informativeness of financial statement for decision making, as resource allocation, evaluation and contracting activities. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the \"vicious downward cycle\" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.    Students who have a strong mathematical background but who do not have the required Calculus pre-requisite are encouraged to contact Professor Chacon for a possible pre-requisite waiver.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.    *Prerequisites: Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111) or Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101)    *Required for Economics majors in the theory track; other students with a focus on quantitative analysis are encouraged to take SOCSC-AD 113 instead of Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110). This can be used as a substitute for SOCSC-AD 110.

SRPP-AD 115J Social Networks                                                                              Social networks are the subject of some of the most exciting recent advances in the natural and social sciences. This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.
