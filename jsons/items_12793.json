Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

Application FAQs   Professional science writing (and editing and producing, too) is a wonderfully satisfying field but also a challenging one. The right graduate training can make you a much better journalist and give you some big advantages in the job market, but you should investigate your options thoroughly before committing to any grad program. (As you consider the possibilities, you may find this blog post , this Q &amp; A ,\u00a0and this Nature article to be useful; they include contributions from faculty and alumni of SHERP and other science journalism programs. This Q &amp; A with a SHERP adjunct professor also includes some good advice for aspiring science journalists.)   If you have a record of achievement in and out of the classroom, a passion for science and a flair for storytelling, we want to hear from you! Just keep in mind that we're unable to offer admission to many deserving applicants because there are only 12-14 spots in a typical SHERP class, and almost all of the students we admit choose to enroll. Therefore, the application process is important and you should take it seriously.   What kind of student does SHERP look for?   Many kinds! SHERP students have diverse backgrounds ; there is no single formula for admission and subsequent professional success. Most accepted applicants have science degrees at the undergraduate or graduate level; many have research experience. On the other hand, some of SHERP \u2019s most accomplished graduates came to the program with little formal scientific training, so don't regard yourself as automatically disqualified if you discovered your fervor for science and storytelling only recently. Experience in journalism, including published clips, is an asset for admission but definitely not a necessity.   The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for all applicants, including those with graduate degrees. Successful candidates tend to have GRE verbal scores above the 80th percentile and grade point averages above 3.3. Again, however, there have been notable exceptions. The essay section of the application is weighed heavily in admissions. Letters of recommendation and writing samples are very important, too.   Our general advice: If you believe SHERP may be the right program for you, don't disqualify yourself without trying! There's only one way to find out whether you and SHERP are a good match and that is to apply.   How can I learn more about SHERP?   You've already found the best place to begin. The interlinked SHERP web pages contain all sorts of useful information about our program, everything from faculty biographies and class descriptions to profiles of current students , an alumni directory , a list of recent student internships and a gallery of newly published stories by students and graduates. So take your time and explore all of these pages carefully.   You don't need to restrict your research to web surfing, however. While we don't require an interview, we do encourage serious applicants to visit during the fall or spring semesters to sit in on classes and meet faculty and students. Email SHERP to arrange a visit. You're at no disadvantage in the admissions process if you're unable to come. We encourage visits solely for your benefit; they're the best way to see what we do, so you can make an informed judgment about whether our program is right for you.   You should also feel free to reach out to our graduates; they are SHERP's best ambassadors. You can email them directly via the addresses listed on the alumni page , or you can contact us and we'll gladly put you in touch with alumni and current students who share your background, interests and aspirations. We ask only that you not send out mass queries because our graduates and students are busy people.   Please contact us if you have additional questions that are not answered here or on the other SHERP web pages.   What if I'm not from the United States?   SHERP has a long and proud history of welcoming students from all over the world. However, because SHERP is a professional writing program, all applicants must demonstrate true fluency in written and spoken English. In addition to the GRE, non-native speakers must take the Internet-based (IBT) Test of English as a Foreign Language . (The TOEFL requirement is waived if you received an undergraduate or graduate degree from an institution at which the language of instruction is English.) To be considered for admission, you'll need a score of at least 100 on the Internet-based TOEFL , and successful applicants tend to score higher.   Like American students, international students are eligible for NYU-provided scholarships and other financial aid. However, foreign students in most cases are not eligible for grants or loans from the U.S. government. We encourage international applicants to seek outside funding from their governments or from foundations and other private sources.   \u00a0 How much will it cost?   Tuition is assessed on a per-point basis by the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS). The 16-month SHERP sequence is 44 points, or credits, for the M.A. in Journalism plus an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. The tuition rate for the 2014-15 academic year is $1,554 per point; a new rate will apply in September 2015 for the final semester. If next year's increase is typical, tuition for the entire 16-month, 44-point SHERP sequence will total approximately $69,000, not counting any financial aid awards. Registration fees are additional: an average of $461 for the first point each semester and $65 for each additional point. See the financial aid pages of the GSAS site for up-to-date information on aid, tuition and fees.   New York City is an amazing place to live but also an expensive one. SHERP students typically pay anywhere from $550 to $1,300 per month for housing, depending on the neighborhood and the number of roommates. There is a limited amount of NYU housing available to graduate students; university rents are similar to the private market.   \u00a0 Is there financial aid?   Yes. Most students receive some aid from SHERP, typically in the form of tuition remission scholarships . However, our aid budget is limited and all SHERP students are expected to cover a significant share of their tuition and other expenses by tapping other sources, including work-study opportunities and government loans administered through the NYU Office of Financial Aid , as well as outside scholarships from foundations and other private sources. (NYU will match qualifying outside aid under the Tuition Incentive Program .) We do not offer teaching assistantships.   Students seeking SHERP -administered scholarships should apply by January 4, and should indicate on their applications that they are seeking aid.   May I enroll part-time or defer admission?   We are unable to accept part-time students. All SHERP students  start in September and are expected to complete the program by  December of the following year. Please also note that we are unable to grant deferments to accepted students except under extraordinary circumstances; you should apply the year in which you hope to enroll.   When is the application deadline?   The formal application deadline is January 4 for students seeking to enroll the following September. Please bear in mind that it can take a month or longer for GRE and TOEFL scores to reach us, so plan accordingly.   Will you accept late applications?   Yes. We begin issuing admission offers on a rolling basis in February, so it's in your interest to get your application in as early as possible even if you're still waiting for a test score report or an official transcript, which you can add later.   Where can I get an application?   Applications are available from the GSAS application resource center starting in mid-September.   Note: All application materials (including test score reports) should be sent directly to GSAS , not to the Carter Journalism Institute or SHERP. Please visit the application resource center for further instructions.   What if I have additional questions?   Just ask! Before you do, though, please take a careful look at the all of the interlinked SHERP web pages , which contain a lot of useful information, including curriculum , faculty , student profiles , internships and jobs , publishing , alumni and the story gallery .   NOTE: there is a federally manated\u00a0 disclosure statement for SHERP, though you can find more complete information on costs , aid , and job placement elsewhere on the SHERP site.\u00a0                                               Arthur L.

Aspiring science reporters, authors, editors, producers, videographers, coders and bloggers (and various permutations thereof) who complete the intensive 16-month program receive a Master of Arts degree in Journalism and an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. They join an extended family of graduates (391 at last count!) committed to covering scientific, medical and environmental topics with precision, nuance and passion.   SHERP alumni have diverse backgrounds and beliefs and work in many types of digital, print and broadcast media in twenty-five countries. What unites them are two deeply held convictions: science is too important to leave only to scientists, and journalism is too important to leave only to the scientifically illiterate.   SHERP 's current students are the newest links in a chain that stretches back to the program's founding in 1982 by Bill Burrows , who retired in 2008 and was succeeded as SHERP director by Dan Fagin , a longtime science and environmental journalist who was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction for his book, Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation .\u00a0   What We Do: A Customized Curriculum, a Hands-On Approach   Humans are a storytelling species, and the scientific enterprise is the wellspring of many of our greatest contemporary narratives. But how many of us possess the skills to make these narratives our profession? SHERP 's customized curriculum is tailored to develop world-class science storytellers at a time of unprecedented change, challenge and opportunity in journalism. Our faculty of nationally prominent science journalists offers rigorous instruction in research, reporting, writing and editing through coverage of cutting-edge science, from nanotechnology and epigenetics to global climate change and cosmology. Coursework is built around case studies and learning by doing, not academic theory or rote memorization.   A key focus is reporting, writing and editing features and news for magazines and online sites , but students also dive into all forms of modern journalism, from books and long-form narratives to blogs , videos , audio podcasts , data visualization \u00a0and social media . Entrepreneurial skills, including self-marketing, are emphasized throughout the SHERP sequence and especially in a new class focusing on developing sound business models for digital science journalism projects. Investigative science journalism is also an important curricular focus, as evidenced by a recent investigation conducted by Professor Charles Seife and his SHERP students into fraudulent drug studies submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. The powerful results of this faculty-student collaboration\u00a0 were published \u00a0in 2015 in JAMA-Internal Medicine and Slate .   Visual journalism is woven into the curriculum from the first semester, when every SHERP student learns to shoot and edit video under the tutelage of an experienced videographer \u00a0who also provides advanced instruction during the second semester. There is also a workshop on data mining, analysis and visualization taught by graphics editors at the Times . We teach audio podcasting, too. The curriculum reflects our philosophy that twenty-first century journalism education should be platform-agnostic : the content of the story should dictate its form, not vice versa. Whether they do most of their work in print or online, our graduates thrive in the fast-changing science journalism landscape because they are comfortable telling stories on mulltiple platforms, in multiple ways.   The culture at SHERP is challenging but never cutthroat. We emphasize cooperative learning in an informal, intellectually rich  environment. SHERP students work hard and love what they do. Thanks to  the specialized curriculum and intimate atmosphere, \"sherpies\" form lifelong bonds during their sixteen months in the program, including eight marriages so far!   Where We Work: NYC, the World Capital of Science Journalism   SHERP takes full advantage of its home base at the center of the science journalism firmament: New York City, where there are more journalism job opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Our neighborhood is a particularly fertile one for science storytelling because\u00a020 Cooper Square is right in the middle of Lower Manhattan's booming Silicon Alley; Facebook and IBM's Jeopardy!-winning Watson computer are one block away.\u00a0A small program nested comfortably in a large research university, SHERP utilizes the vast intellectual resources of New York University, including the NYU School of Medicine, to enrich student experiences.\u00a0We also reach well beyond the university community.\u00a0In addition to two full-time professors with many years of experience in professional science journalism, Dan Fagin and Charles Seife , the program's superb faculty includes current or former editors and writers at Scientific  American , The New York Times , Science , Reuters ,  Nature and The Wall Street Journal , among other outlets. SHERP faculty work at the very highest levels of science journalism but are also deeply committed to the hard work of teaching well, with long track records of success in the classroom as well as the newsroom.     \u00a0        The curriculum also draws heavily on a roster of guest speakers constituting a who's who of science journalism and science research.  In a typical year, nearly one hundred journalists and scientists  visit SHERP to speak in classes or at evening seminars that have become gathering places for the New York science journalism community. There are also yearly field trips to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , the American Museum of Natural History and CNN. When SHERP students go on a field trip, they do much more than tour; they pitch stories to editors and participate in seminars with leading researchers.   Science journalism internships at leading publications, programs and web sites are a crucial part of the SHERP experience and are fully integrated into the overall curriculum, not a tacked-on appendage. Every student completes two for-credit internships during the final eight months of the program, but the internship process actually begins much earlier. Starting in the first semester, SHERP's internship coordinator provides personalized support and advice, assisting students in landing positions and then making sure they get the most out of their internship experiences. SHERP interns don't get coffee, except for themselves; they get clips . Many choose to intern at outlets that have worked closely with SHERP for years ; their supervisors are often alumni or current or former faculty. Others take advantage of the flexibility of the our internship program to secure internships at exciting new digital publishing ventures or\u00a0 places \u00a0 a little \u00a0 farther off the beaten track \u00a0for science journalists.     \u00a0   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   SHERP's popular Inside-Out speaker series features candid conversations with some of the world's most prominent science journalists.   Watch More &gt;   \u00a0   \u00a0        Our Focus: Building Skills and Portfolios   To thrive in today's convergent media environment, science journalists need diverse skills and a broad portfolio of published work. SHERP delivers both. By graduation, a typical SHERP student has written or edited dozens of stories of all lengths and types, produced several video and audio pieces, built data graphics and slide shows and even authored a book proposal -- all prepared in close collaboration with highly accomplished professors who are leaders in science journalism.\u00a0   The stories SHERP students produce for their classes are of such high quality that every year many are published in professional media. In addition, students gain invaluable experience by assigning, reporting, writing and editing stories for Scienceline , an award-winning webzine run entirely by SHERP students. Scienceline's mix of news, features, profiles , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations attracts approximately 6,000 visitors per day (more than 2 million per year) from around the world. In addition, Scienceline stories are regularly syndicated to the web sites of Scientific American , Discover , Popular Science , LiveScience.com , Space.com , OnEarth , The Scientist and other outlets , generating even more clips, exposure and opportunities for SHERP students. Finally, SHERP's unrivalled internship program puts students in position to publish their work in places like The New York  Times , NOVA , Wired and dozens of other globally prominent outlets .   Life After SHERP   Job placement is a proven strength of SHERP. Every year, several graduating students go to work full-time at places where they were SHERP interns; other job-seeking graduates tap the close-knit and extensive SHERP alumni network, which operates its own busy email list. Over the years, editors have come to trust the SHERP \"brand,\" so graduates fare very well in the extremely competitive market for staff jobs and freelance work in science journalism.   SHERP alumni regularly return to Cooper Square for evening seminars and other special events , and as guest speakers in classes. They also assist their successors by generously contributing to the Bill Burrows SHERP Scholarship Fund. The tight bonds between current and former students and faculty (both present and past ) are a distinguishing feature of SHERP and a crucial asset for \"SHERPies\" new and old. (Long after they've graduated, SHERPies love to collaborate with each other, whether on serious editor-writer partnerships or this parody video .)   Join Us!

Application FAQs   Professional science writing (and editing and producing, too) is a wonderfully satisfying field but also a challenging one. The right graduate training can make you a much better journalist and give you some big advantages in the job market, but you should investigate your options thoroughly before committing to any grad program. (As you consider the possibilities, you may find this blog post , this Q &amp; A ,\u00a0and this Nature article to be useful; they include contributions from faculty and alumni of SHERP and other science journalism programs. This Q &amp; A with a SHERP adjunct professor also includes some good advice for aspiring science journalists.)   If you have a record of achievement in and out of the classroom, a passion for science and a flair for storytelling, we want to hear from you! Just keep in mind that we're unable to offer admission to many deserving applicants because there are only 12-14 spots in a typical SHERP class, and almost all of the students we admit choose to enroll. Therefore, the application process is important and you should take it seriously.   What kind of student does SHERP look for?   Many kinds! SHERP students have diverse backgrounds ; there is no single formula for admission and subsequent professional success. Most accepted applicants have science degrees at the undergraduate or graduate level; many have research experience. On the other hand, some of SHERP \u2019s most accomplished graduates came to the program with little formal scientific training, so don't regard yourself as automatically disqualified if you discovered your fervor for science and storytelling only recently. Experience in journalism, including published clips, is an asset for admission but definitely not a necessity.   The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for all applicants, including those with graduate degrees. Successful candidates tend to have GRE verbal scores above the 80th percentile and grade point averages above 3.3. Again, however, there have been notable exceptions. The essay section of the application is weighed heavily in admissions. Letters of recommendation and writing samples are very important, too.   Our general advice: If you believe SHERP may be the right program for you, don't disqualify yourself without trying! There's only one way to find out whether you and SHERP are a good match and that is to apply.   How can I learn more about SHERP?   You've already found the best place to begin. The interlinked SHERP web pages contain all sorts of useful information about our program, everything from faculty biographies and class descriptions to profiles of current students , an alumni directory , a list of recent student internships and a gallery of newly published stories by students and graduates. So take your time and explore all of these pages carefully.   You don't need to restrict your research to web surfing, however. While we don't require an interview, we do encourage serious applicants to visit during the fall or spring semesters to sit in on classes and meet faculty and students. Email SHERP to arrange a visit. You're at no disadvantage in the admissions process if you're unable to come. We encourage visits solely for your benefit; they're the best way to see what we do, so you can make an informed judgment about whether our program is right for you.   You should also feel free to reach out to our graduates; they are SHERP's best ambassadors. You can email them directly via the addresses listed on the alumni page , or you can contact us and we'll gladly put you in touch with alumni and current students who share your background, interests and aspirations. We ask only that you not send out mass queries because our graduates and students are busy people.   Please contact us if you have additional questions that are not answered here or on the other SHERP web pages.   What if I'm not from the United States?   SHERP has a long and proud history of welcoming students from all over the world. However, because SHERP is a professional writing program, all applicants must demonstrate true fluency in written and spoken English. In addition to the GRE, non-native speakers must take the Internet-based (IBT) Test of English as a Foreign Language . (The TOEFL requirement is waived if you received an undergraduate or graduate degree from an institution at which the language of instruction is English.) To be considered for admission, you'll need a score of at least 100 on the Internet-based TOEFL , and successful applicants tend to score higher.   Like American students, international students are eligible for NYU-provided scholarships and other financial aid. However, foreign students in most cases are not eligible for grants or loans from the U.S. government. We encourage international applicants to seek outside funding from their governments or from foundations and other private sources.   \u00a0 How much will it cost?   Tuition is assessed on a per-point basis by the NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS). The 16-month SHERP sequence is 44 points, or credits, for the M.A. in Journalism plus an Advanced Certificate in Science, Health and Environmental Reporting. The tuition rate for the 2014-15 academic year is $1,554 per point; a new rate will apply in September 2015 for the final semester. If next year's increase is typical, tuition for the entire 16-month, 44-point SHERP sequence will total approximately $69,000, not counting any financial aid awards. Registration fees are additional: an average of $461 for the first point each semester and $65 for each additional point. See the financial aid pages of the GSAS site for up-to-date information on aid, tuition and fees.   New York City is an amazing place to live but also an expensive one. SHERP students typically pay anywhere from $550 to $1,300 per month for housing, depending on the neighborhood and the number of roommates. There is a limited amount of NYU housing available to graduate students; university rents are similar to the private market.   \u00a0 Is there financial aid?   Yes. Most students receive some aid from SHERP, typically in the form of tuition remission scholarships . However, our aid budget is limited and all SHERP students are expected to cover a significant share of their tuition and other expenses by tapping other sources, including work-study opportunities and government loans administered through the NYU Office of Financial Aid , as well as outside scholarships from foundations and other private sources. (NYU will match qualifying outside aid under the Tuition Incentive Program .) We do not offer teaching assistantships.   Students seeking SHERP -administered scholarships should apply by January 4, and should indicate on their applications that they are seeking aid.   May I enroll part-time or defer admission?   We are unable to accept part-time students. All SHERP students  start in September and are expected to complete the program by  December of the following year. Please also note that we are unable to grant deferments to accepted students except under extraordinary circumstances; you should apply the year in which you hope to enroll.   When is the application deadline?   The formal application deadline is January 4 for students seeking to enroll the following September. Please bear in mind that it can take a month or longer for GRE and TOEFL scores to reach us, so plan accordingly.   Will you accept late applications?   Yes. We begin issuing admission offers on a rolling basis in February, so it's in your interest to get your application in as early as possible even if you're still waiting for a test score report or an official transcript, which you can add later.   Where can I get an application?   Applications are available from the GSAS application resource center starting in mid-September.   Note: All application materials (including test score reports) should be sent directly to GSAS , not to the Carter Journalism Institute or SHERP. Please visit the application resource center for further instructions.   What if I have additional questions?   Just ask! Before you do, though, please take a careful look at the all of the interlinked SHERP web pages , which contain a lot of useful information, including curriculum , faculty , student profiles , internships and jobs , publishing , alumni and the story gallery .   NOTE: there is a federally manated\u00a0 disclosure statement for SHERP, though you can find more complete information on costs , aid , and job placement elsewhere on the SHERP site.\u00a0                                               Arthur L.

She thought she was going to be a research scientist until she realized she enjoyed cornering people to tell them about science more than actually doing it. Now her experimenting will be confined to the kitchen, while she instead learns how to articulate her excitement about the natural world more convincingly than \u201cTHIS IS SO COOL!\u201d   \u00a0   \u00a0   Chelsey B. Coombs graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a B.S. in Molecular and Cellular Biology and too many bee stings to count (having researched honey bee aggression for three years). At UIUC, she wrote articles and created multimedia presentations about science for the News Bureau and the School of MCB. When she's not writing, she's almost certainly on Twitter.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Katherine Foley \u00a0proudly hails from Wilmington, Delaware. She holds a B.S. in Science, Technology and International Affairs from Georgetown University. When she's not following her favorite science writers in print or podcasts, Katherine enjoys long-distance running, spicy Korean BBQ, and swing dancing. Her journalistic interests include genetically modified foods, space exploration, and everything in between.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Jeni Hackett is a graduate of the College of William and Mary, where she attained a B.A. in History and a minor in Physics. She\u2019s always been fascinated by science but writing and communication have been her specialty; combining the two by pursuing science journalism seemed like the logical (and fun) thing to do. When not writing about things like space probes or weird particles, she enjoys sewing, video games, and anything involving atomic culture.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Shannon Hall is hooked on three things: the smell of freshly ground coffee beans, the feeling of enthrallment while traveling solo, and the wonders of the Universe. She earned her B.A. from Whitman College in physics-astronomy and philosophy, and her M.S. from the University of Wyoming in astronomy. A compulsion to share the stories strung throughout the Universe has led her 3,000 miles from the forests to the mountains and now to the city.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Rebecca Harrington graduated from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities with a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Journalism. She worked at the U\u2019s student newspaper the Minnesota Daily, where she discovered her passion for explaining the complexities and bizarre aspects of science to non-scientists. You can often find her cooking without recipes, discussing scientific explanations for everything around her, and laughing at the little surprises in life.   \u00a0   \u00a0   JoAnna Klein is a scientist and writer from North Carolina, currently based in Brooklyn. She has a master\u2019s in Psychology from Appalachian State University and worked four years in Dr. Joseph LeDoux\u2019s world-renowned neuroscience lab. Currently, JoAnna is working with Blue Chalk Media on Ochre, a new blog on visual journalism. She is excited about chartering a new journalism landscape. She aspires to humanize science through solid storyline, compelling visuals and immersive multimedia experiences.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Nicole Lou is a native New Yorker and a graduate of Williams College with majors in Spanish and Biology. She has worked with plants, bacteria, birds, and mice during her times in various labs and is excited to learn how basic science can better reach humans. You might run into her on one of her quests for dim sum and a good trivia game in town.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Hanneke Weitering is a lifelong physics fanatic from Knoxville, Tennessee. While pursuing a B.S. in Physics at the University of Tennessee, she discovered her passion for science communication and dove into the world of journalism. First, she began writing stories for the Sci/Tech column at Tennessee Journalist. Afterwards she joined the Joint Institute for Computational Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where she wrote features about research being performed on the Kraken and Nautilus supercomputers.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Steph Yin \u00a0spent her undergraduate career at Brown University chasing research opportunities\u2014leading her to a remote island in Indonesia, a Marine Corps Base in North Carolina and salt marshes across Cape Cod\u2014before she realized she preferred the stories to the academic interpretations of these experiences. Armed with an Environmental Science degree and two decades of science media consumption (she read all her Kids Discovers), she\u2019s making the move from dreamy Providence to NYC.   \u00a0   \u00a0   Lauren Young \u00a0is passionate for both science and writing, as she majored in Biology and minored in English at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Between bug hunting and wielding micropipettes, Lauren created an academic journal for scientists-in-training and wrote stories for her university library\u2019s blog. She also loves traveling, show tunes and strong coffee. Lauren can\u2019t wait to begin her adventures as a SHERPie in New York City.   \u00a0   \u00a0   View profiles of the 32nd ,\u00a0 31st ,\u00a0 30th ,\u00a0 29th ,\u00a0 28th ,\u00a0 27th ,\u00a0 26th ,\u00a0 25th \u00a0and\u00a0 24th \u00a0SHERP classes.   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.
