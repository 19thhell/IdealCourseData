This course analyzes the historical and cultural contingency of race-based affirmative action policies in Brazil and to analyze the broader contemporary controversies and social implications of the globalization of higher education.    Brazil has the largest (and by most measures, best) higher education system in Latin America, and enrollments have undergone explosive growth over the last 20 years. We begin with an historical overview then move to an analysis of contemporary issues. Students gain an understanding of the variety of higher education institutions in Brazil (federal and state public institutions, private non-profit and private for-profit universities, etc.) and become familiar with issues of internationalization in higher education, faculty and student mobility, research in a global context, variation among public versus private universities and their economic structures, the role of foreign university partnerships, and other higher education issues.    As a major focus, we use race &ndash; an extremely context-dependent ideology &ndash; as a main entry point into an examination of Brazilian higher education. Brazil began to implement affirmative action policies in 2003, stoking enormous cultural, legal, and education debates. At the same time, there were also huge changes in funding and government oversight at universities.

Next offering is August 2016.    This course analyzes the historical and cultural contingency of race-based affirmative action policies in Brazil and to analyze the broader contemporary controversies and social implications of the globalization of higher education.    Brazil has the largest (and by most measures, best) higher education system in Latin America, and enrollments have undergone explosive growth over the last 20 years. We begin with an historical overview then move to an analysis of contemporary issues. Students gain an understanding of the variety of higher education institutions in Brazil (federal and state public institutions, private non-profit and private for-profit universities, etc.) and become familiar with issues of internationalization in higher education, faculty and student mobility, research in a global context, variation among public versus private universities and their economic structures, the role of foreign university partnerships, and other higher education issues.    As a major focus, we use race &ndash; an extremely context-dependent ideology &ndash; as a main entry point into an examination of Brazilian higher education. Brazil began to implement affirmative action policies in 2003, stoking enormous cultural, legal, and education debates. At the same time, there were also huge changes in funding and government oversight at universities. The terms of the debates around access to higher education are different in Brazil and the United States, and the stakes and stakeholders are different, but the intensity of the issue is very high.

Next offering is August 2016.    This course analyzes the historical and cultural contingency of race-based affirmative action policies in Brazil and to analyze the broader contemporary controversies and social implications of the globalization of higher education.    Brazil has the largest (and by most measures, best) higher education system in Latin America, and enrollments have undergone explosive growth over the last 20 years. We begin with an historical overview then move to an analysis of contemporary issues. Students gain an understanding of the variety of higher education institutions in Brazil (federal and state public institutions, private non-profit and private for-profit universities, etc.) and become familiar with issues of internationalization in higher education, faculty and student mobility, research in a global context, variation among public versus private universities and their economic structures, the role of foreign university partnerships, and other higher education issues.    As a major focus, we use race &ndash; an extremely context-dependent ideology &ndash; as a main entry point into an examination of Brazilian higher education. Brazil began to implement affirmative action policies in 2003, stoking enormous cultural, legal, and education debates. At the same time, there were also huge changes in funding and government oversight at universities.
