Internship Opportunities          NYU Sydney offers two distinct internship programs: for-credit and not-for-credit. While a key defining component is an academic course associated with the for-credit internships, they differ in placement process, time commitment, and breadth of opportunities.   Students who apply and are accepted in to the for-credit internship program are guaranteed a placement within a wide range of industries. These placements take the form of a traditional internship (11 weeks, 16 hours per week). Participants will work with NYU staff and our internship partner, CAPA International Education, to identify and secure an ideal placement. Students will also participate in a academic course that reflects critically and analytically on how the internship experience impacts their understanding of Australian culture and relates to personal and professional goals.

Students who apply to the non-credit (BTC) program will work with local NYU Sydney staff to identify an internship placement or volunteer experience. There is no guarantee that the specific placement assigned will lead to an internship, an initial interview with the host organisation will take place, before anything is confirmed. The time commitment for non-credit internships, tend be less than the for-credit program. There is no fixed requirement in the number of hours students must intern for BTC placements, however, most students will intern for one full day or two half days. It is important that the internship schedule agreed upon with the host organisation is honoured by the student, and punctuality and attendance is taken seriously. As well as attending their internship, BTC students have two seminars they must attend throughout semester, as well as two one-on-one check ins with the NYU Sydney Internship Coordinator and a possible guest lecture. BTC seminars allow students to discuss their internship experience collectively, as well as; differences in U.S. and Australian work culture and how to utilise their Sydney internship experience in future job interviews and applications.   Previous students who have engaged in non-credit internships have found that it has complemented their academic experience, built on their professional skills, provided them with international industry exposure and deepened their connection to the local Sydney community, and the Australian community at large.

The time commitment for non-credit internships, tend be less than the for-credit program. There is no fixed requirement in the number of hours students must intern for BTC placements, however, most students will intern for one full day or two half days. It is important that the internship schedule agreed upon with the host organisation is honoured by the student, and punctuality and attendance is taken seriously. As well as attending their internship, BTC students have two seminars they must attend throughout semester, as well as two one-on-one check ins with the NYU Sydney Internship Coordinator and a possible guest lecture. BTC seminars allow students to discuss their internship experience collectively, as well as; differences in U.S. and Australian work culture and how to utilise their Sydney internship experience in future job interviews and applications.   Previous students who have engaged in non-credit internships have found that it has complemented their academic experience, built on their professional skills, provided them with international industry exposure and deepened their connection to the local Sydney community, and the Australian community at large.            Non-Credit Opportunities          The following is a list of current and past opportunities, subject to change each semester. New internships and volunteer opportunities are constantly being created. If you do not see your area of interest listed, or are interested in interning for a specific organisation you have identified; please do not hesitate to contact us at nyusydney.btc@nyu.edu with this information and we will strive to create an opportunity for you.

This is my second semester in the International Education program here at NYU Steinhardt with a focus on education development. Prior to entering the program, I worked in an Investment Bank and found while I enjoyed my work, something was missing, and thus the search began. I took some time off and worked with a non-profit organization in India to teach Basic English and Math to underprivileged children and that&rsquo;s where my journey in International Education started. When I am not occupied with coursework, I am at a studio or gym practicing yoga or exploring different restaurants. I look forward to this amazing opportunity to represent and serve the student body with fun-filled, educational, and knowledge sharing activities with the aim to make graduate life a well-rounded experience for all.

I came from Beijing, the capital city of China, and finished my bachelor degree in English Literature and Culture at Beijing International Studies University. The Olympics&rsquo; voluntary experience raised my interest in the field of cultural exchange, which brought me to NYU. I also taught voluntarily in elementary school for migrant children and worked for NGOs in Beijing before moving to the States. I used to have a rather hard time in the city during the first two months, yet soon adjusted to the new environment with the help of the members in this lovely program. I wish you all a great time here, and will be happy to answer all your questions.

Internship Opportunities          NYU Sydney offers two distinct internship programs: for-credit and not-for-credit. While a key defining component is an academic course associated with the for-credit internships, they differ in placement process, time commitment, and breadth of opportunities.   Students who apply and are accepted in to the for-credit internship program are guaranteed a placement within a wide range of industries. These placements take the form of a traditional internship (11 weeks, 16 hours per week). Participants will work with NYU staff and our internship partner, CAPA International Education, to identify and secure an ideal placement. Students will also participate in a academic course that reflects critically and analytically on how the internship experience impacts their understanding of Australian culture and relates to personal and professional goals. If you are interested in applying for an internship for credit, learn more here .     Students who apply to the non-credit (BTC) program will work with local NYU Sydney staff to identify an internship placement or volunteer experience. There is no guarantee that the specific placement assigned will lead to an internship, an initial interview with the host organisation will take place, before anything is confirmed. The time commitment for non-credit internships, tend be less than the for-credit program. There is no fixed requirement in the number of hours students must intern for BTC placements, however, most students will intern for one full day or two half days. It is important that the internship schedule agreed upon with the host organisation is honoured by the student, and punctuality and attendance is taken seriously. As well as attending their internship, BTC students have two seminars they must attend throughout semester, as well as two one-on-one check ins with the NYU Sydney Internship Coordinator and a possible guest lecture. BTC seminars allow students to discuss their internship experience collectively, as well as; differences in U.S. and Australian work culture and how to utilise their Sydney internship experience in future job interviews and applications.   Previous students who have engaged in non-credit internships have found that it has complemented their academic experience, built on their professional skills, provided them with international industry exposure and deepened their connection to the local Sydney community, and the Australian community at large.            Non-Credit Opportunities          The following is a list of current and past opportunities, subject to change each semester. New internships and volunteer opportunities are constantly being created. If you do not see your area of interest listed, or are interested in interning for a specific organisation you have identified; please do not hesitate to contact us at nyusydney.btc@nyu.edu with this information and we will strive to create an opportunity for you. Or alternatively, you can note this in your application form . Applications for Fall 2015 are NOW OPEN.                                                    1.

Navigating my own diverse background as a Palestinian citizen of Israel, I am determined to keep working on bringing both sides closer to a resolution that respects both the complexity of the region&rsquo;s history and culture, as well as the dignity of both parties; as I have worked extensively both in Israel and in the US to promote coexistence between Arab and Jewish children living in Israel.

I was born and raised in Korea until my parents decided to move to Canada. I spent half of my life in Seoul and the other half in Toronto. Immersion into the very homogenous and very multicultural societies has sparked in me a long interest in the relations between place and psychological makeup of the collective and the individual. I consider my identity a relativistic product of the immigration dilemma, of which I wish to explore further with a special focus on immigrant adolescents.

This is my second semester in the International Education program here at NYU Steinhardt with a focus on education development. Prior to entering the program, I worked in an Investment Bank and found while I enjoyed my work, something was missing, and thus the search began. I took some time off and worked with a non-profit organization in India to teach Basic English and Math to underprivileged children and that&rsquo;s where my journey in International Education started. When I am not occupied with coursework, I am at a studio or gym practicing yoga or exploring different restaurants. I look forward to this amazing opportunity to represent and serve the student body with fun-filled, educational, and knowledge sharing activities with the aim to make graduate life a well-rounded experience for all.

I came from Beijing, the capital city of China, and finished my bachelor degree in English Literature and Culture at Beijing International Studies University. The Olympics&rsquo; voluntary experience raised my interest in the field of cultural exchange, which brought me to NYU. I also taught voluntarily in elementary school for migrant children and worked for NGOs in Beijing before moving to the States. I used to have a rather hard time in the city during the first two months, yet soon adjusted to the new environment with the help of the members in this lovely program. I wish you all a great time here, and will be happy to answer all your questions.

The International Health Program at NYU SoM was started in 2002 to provide structure and support for international experiences that contribute to medical education.\u00a0 Since its inception over 300 NYU SoM medical students have participated in the program.   We work directly with students and faculty to identify and evaluate international health sites and projects. Students may identify a clinical site for an away-rotation during their clinical years.\u00a0   Research projects are supported and must align with one of the following broad areas: clinical research, population and public health research, geographically relevant basic science research, health systems &amp; quality improvement research (including medical education &amp; training), human rights &amp; health research, or research that contributes to or addresses a public health need.   A rigorous application process for both clinical and research experiences ensures that students are actively committed to their learning that complements their NYU-based medical education.\u00a0 Before departure, students are required to complete any necessary IRB process for their research, participate in cultural sensitivity workshops, and register for international health insurance and any necessary immunizations.   Upon completion of the project, students submit an evaluation and reflection on their learning experience.\u00a0 In addition, students taking a research elective submit the Scholarly Product, often a poster or PowerPoint presentation to be displayed during our International Health Week. \u00a0   Global Health Concentration students must complete 8 weeks of research internationally through IHP.\u00a0 The requirements for the Scholarly Product for concentration students can be found here .\u00a0 A number of students continue their research beyond the international experience and have subsequently published their work in significant journals or presented at (inter) national conferences.   Students traveling internationally on academic conferences and for research or other academic programs that involve international travel must coordinate with the IHP office to ensure they meet the necessary safety and registration requirements.   In addition, the International Health Program is now coordinating a bi-monthly lecture series, The Global Health Symposia, to bring together the NYU and broader NY community working and learning in Global Health.\u00a0 Talks cover a range of topics, including innovations and controversies in Global Health, as well as discussions about where and how medicine and medical students can participate and contribute to Global Health work.
