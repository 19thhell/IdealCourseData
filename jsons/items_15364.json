The university boasts an impressive array of departments and disciplines complimenting its extensive research and educational facilities. Students will benefit from all the resources of a large research university and enjoy the dynamic, energetic environment of Beijing.   Up to two NYU Law students may participate per year. Students must be second or third-year, and have spent at least one full year at the NYU School of Law. All courses in the LLM program are conducted in English. LLB courses are conducted in Chinese.   Peking University was originally founded in 1898 and has experienced a wide variety of changes over the past century. The University\u2019s consistent commitment to a modern curriculum and scientific research has produced noteworthy graduates and prize-winning faculty. Peking University\u2019s website can be accessed here .   Peking University School of Law, officially established in 1999, is notable for its consistent and prominent contributions to Chinese legal theory. The school founded the first intellectual property law department in Chinese history, and offers popular courses in Legal Theory Studies. In addition, the school boasts over 30 research institutes, and maintains strong programs in international exchange and study abroad. The PKU Law School website is available here .   As the capital city of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Beijing lies at the heart of Chinese cultural and social identity. The sprawling northern city boasts a population of nearly twenty million and has remained China\u2019s political capital for over three centuries. As a result, life in Beijing is an endless exploration of sights and sounds. From wandering the city\u2019s enormous Beihai Park to snacking on fried scorpions on Wangfujing Street, there\u2019s never any shortage of entertainment or activity.   Beijing is also home to China\u2019s governing Politburo, which is housed in Tiananmen Square, directly opposite to the walled entrance to the Forbidden City. Other important historical landmarks, such as the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and the nearby Great Wall of China, are designated World Heritage Sites and help contribute to Beijing\u2019s international appeal. Beijing also continues to develop as a hub for transportation and business sectors, and offers international students a thriving, vibrant experience in one of the world\u2019s busiest, most rapidly changing environments.     Dates   Both fall and spring semester study is possible. Fall semester runs approximately from September to December. Spring semester runs mid-February through June.     Courses and Credit   Students are required to enroll in four courses per semester, totaling 12 credits. In order to ensure compliance with all ABA regulations, NYU School of Law requires that all courses be approved by our office before your schedule has been finalized.   A small selection of courses offered:     Chinese Civil Law   Chinese Constitutional and Administrative Law   Chinese Company Law   Chinese Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure   Chinese Judicial System   Legal Chinese Fieldwork   Chinese Foreign Investment Law   International Law as Applied in China: Theory and Practice   Chinese Civil Procedure and Arbitration Law   Chinese Intellectual Property Law   Chinese Economic Law   Chinese Contract Law     The full course listing is available online here .   NYU Law exchange students will receive credit for courses taken at Peking. However, these courses will not count towards the student's GPA. They will only appear on NYU transcripts as credits earned through the exchange program, rather than as individual courses at Peking.     Tuition and Living Expenses   Because this is a revenue-neutral exchange program, participating NYU Law students will pay New York University the normal tuition for a 12 credit-hour semester at NYU Law.   During your stay at Peking you can expect to spend about \u00a55,500 Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY/RMB) per month on living expenses. A rough estimate of living costs is as follows:     Accommodation: \u00a51000-1500 CNY per month   Living expenses: \u00a51000-1500 CNY per month   Insurance: \u00a550 per month   Books: \u00a5800-1,000 per year   Public transport: \u00a51200 CNY per month (unless you live outside of Beijing)     The cost of everyday goods and services in Beijing is generally lower than in New York. If you plan to do any traveling around the country or Asia while in China, you will want to budget for those expenses as well.     Housing   There are different types of housing facilities for international students at PKU. Shaoyuan Accommodation Office is in charge of the Housing on campus for Foreign Students. For reservations and related information, please contact the office directly. Phone No.: 86-10-6275 2264, 86-10-62757361. Students can also choose to live off campus, but must register to the local police station.     Passport and Visa Requirements   A valid passport and visa are required to enter and exit China and must be obtained from Chinese Embassies and Consulates before traveling to China. Americans arriving without valid passports and the appropriate Chinese visa are not permitted to enter and will be subject to a fine and immediate deportation at the traveler's expense. Travelers should not rely on Chinese host organizations claiming to be able to arrange a visa upon arrival.   Chinese authorities have recently tightened their visa issuance policy, in some cases requiring personal interviews of American citizens. Although a bilateral United States-China agreement provides for issuance of multiple-entry visas with validity of up to one year for tourists and business visitors, Chinese consulates often limit visas to only one entry. Visit the Embassy of China website for the most current visa information.     Access for Persons with Disabilities   If you are interested in the program and will need some special assistance due to a disability, please contact the Office of Global Programs who will make contact with PKU to obtain information about the availability of needed services.

If you see a course on PKU\u2019s website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval. If the course is approved you will be notified and it will be added to the list of courses below.

The university boasts an impressive array of departments and disciplines complimenting its extensive research and educational facilities. Students will benefit from all the resources of a large research university and enjoy the dynamic, energetic environment of Beijing.   Up to two NYU Law students may participate per year. Students must be second or third-year, and have spent at least one full year at the NYU School of Law. All courses in the LLM program are conducted in English. LLB courses are conducted in Chinese.   Peking University was originally founded in 1898 and has experienced a wide variety of changes over the past century. The University\u2019s consistent commitment to a modern curriculum and scientific research has produced noteworthy graduates and prize-winning faculty. Peking University\u2019s website can be accessed here .   Peking University School of Law, officially established in 1999, is notable for its consistent and prominent contributions to Chinese legal theory. The school founded the first intellectual property law department in Chinese history, and offers popular courses in Legal Theory Studies. In addition, the school boasts over 30 research institutes, and maintains strong programs in international exchange and study abroad. The PKU Law School website is available here .   As the capital city of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Beijing lies at the heart of Chinese cultural and social identity. The sprawling northern city boasts a population of nearly twenty million and has remained China\u2019s political capital for over three centuries. As a result, life in Beijing is an endless exploration of sights and sounds. From wandering the city\u2019s enormous Beihai Park to snacking on fried scorpions on Wangfujing Street, there\u2019s never any shortage of entertainment or activity.   Beijing is also home to China\u2019s governing Politburo, which is housed in Tiananmen Square, directly opposite to the walled entrance to the Forbidden City. Other important historical landmarks, such as the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and the nearby Great Wall of China, are designated World Heritage Sites and help contribute to Beijing\u2019s international appeal. Beijing also continues to develop as a hub for transportation and business sectors, and offers international students a thriving, vibrant experience in one of the world\u2019s busiest, most rapidly changing environments.     Dates   Both fall and spring semester study is possible. Fall semester runs approximately from September to December. Spring semester runs mid-February through June.     Courses and Credit   Students are required to enroll in four courses per semester, totaling 12 credits. In order to ensure compliance with all ABA regulations, NYU School of Law requires that all courses be approved by our office before your schedule has been finalized.   A small selection of courses offered:     Chinese Civil Law   Chinese Constitutional and Administrative Law   Chinese Company Law   Chinese Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure   Chinese Judicial System   Legal Chinese Fieldwork   Chinese Foreign Investment Law   International Law as Applied in China: Theory and Practice   Chinese Civil Procedure and Arbitration Law   Chinese Intellectual Property Law   Chinese Economic Law   Chinese Contract Law     The full course listing is available online here .   NYU Law exchange students will receive credit for courses taken at Peking. However, these courses will not count towards the student's GPA. They will only appear on NYU transcripts as credits earned through the exchange program, rather than as individual courses at Peking.     Tuition and Living Expenses   Because this is a revenue-neutral exchange program, participating NYU Law students will pay New York University the normal tuition for a 12 credit-hour semester at NYU Law.   During your stay at Peking you can expect to spend about \u00a55,500 Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY/RMB) per month on living expenses. A rough estimate of living costs is as follows:     Accommodation: \u00a51000-1500 CNY per month   Living expenses: \u00a51000-1500 CNY per month   Insurance: \u00a550 per month   Books: \u00a5800-1,000 per year   Public transport: \u00a51200 CNY per month (unless you live outside of Beijing)     The cost of everyday goods and services in Beijing is generally lower than in New York. If you plan to do any traveling around the country or Asia while in China, you will want to budget for those expenses as well.     Housing   There are different types of housing facilities for international students at PKU. Shaoyuan Accommodation Office is in charge of the Housing on campus for Foreign Students. For reservations and related information, please contact the office directly. Phone No.: 86-10-6275 2264, 86-10-62757361. Students can also choose to live off campus, but must register to the local police station.     Passport and Visa Requirements   A valid passport and visa are required to enter and exit China and must be obtained from Chinese Embassies and Consulates before traveling to China. Americans arriving without valid passports and the appropriate Chinese visa are not permitted to enter and will be subject to a fine and immediate deportation at the traveler's expense. Travelers should not rely on Chinese host organizations claiming to be able to arrange a visa upon arrival.   Chinese authorities have recently tightened their visa issuance policy, in some cases requiring personal interviews of American citizens. Although a bilateral United States-China agreement provides for issuance of multiple-entry visas with validity of up to one year for tourists and business visitors, Chinese consulates often limit visas to only one entry. Visit the Embassy of China website for the most current visa information.     Access for Persons with Disabilities   If you are interested in the program and will need some special assistance due to a disability, please contact the Office of Global Programs who will make contact with PKU to obtain information about the availability of needed services.

The university boasts an impressive array of departments and disciplines complimenting its extensive research and educational facilities. Students will benefit from all the resources of a large research university and enjoy the dynamic, energetic environment of Beijing.   Up to two NYU Law students may participate per year. Students must be second or third-year, and have spent at least one full year at the NYU School of Law. All courses in the LLM program are conducted in English. LLB courses are conducted in Chinese.   Peking University was originally founded in 1898 and has experienced a wide variety of changes over the past century. The University\u2019s consistent commitment to a modern curriculum and scientific research has produced noteworthy graduates and prize-winning faculty. Peking University\u2019s website can be accessed here .   Peking University School of Law, officially established in 1999, is notable for its consistent and prominent contributions to Chinese legal theory. The school founded the first intellectual property law department in Chinese history, and offers popular courses in Legal Theory Studies. In addition, the school boasts over 30 research institutes, and maintains strong programs in international exchange and study abroad. The PKU Law School website is available here .   As the capital city of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Beijing lies at the heart of Chinese cultural and social identity. The sprawling northern city boasts a population of nearly twenty million and has remained China\u2019s political capital for over three centuries. As a result, life in Beijing is an endless exploration of sights and sounds. From wandering the city\u2019s enormous Beihai Park to snacking on fried scorpions on Wangfujing Street, there\u2019s never any shortage of entertainment or activity.   Beijing is also home to China\u2019s governing Politburo, which is housed in Tiananmen Square, directly opposite to the walled entrance to the Forbidden City. Other important historical landmarks, such as the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and the nearby Great Wall of China, are designated World Heritage Sites and help contribute to Beijing\u2019s international appeal. Beijing also continues to develop as a hub for transportation and business sectors, and offers international students a thriving, vibrant experience in one of the world\u2019s busiest, most rapidly changing environments.     Dates   Both fall and spring semester study is possible. Fall semester runs approximately from September to December. Spring semester runs mid-February through June.     Courses and Credit   Students are required to enroll in four courses per semester, totaling 12 credits. In order to ensure compliance with all ABA regulations, NYU School of Law requires that all courses be approved by our office before your schedule has been finalized.   A small selection of courses offered:     Chinese Civil Law   Chinese Constitutional and Administrative Law   Chinese Company Law   Chinese Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure   Chinese Judicial System   Legal Chinese Fieldwork   Chinese Foreign Investment Law   International Law as Applied in China: Theory and Practice   Chinese Civil Procedure and Arbitration Law   Chinese Intellectual Property Law   Chinese Economic Law   Chinese Contract Law     The full course listing is available online here .   NYU Law exchange students will receive credit for courses taken at Peking. However, these courses will not count towards the student's GPA. They will only appear on NYU transcripts as credits earned through the exchange program, rather than as individual courses at Peking.     Tuition and Living Expenses   Because this is a revenue-neutral exchange program, participating NYU Law students will pay New York University the normal tuition for a 12 credit-hour semester at NYU Law.   During your stay at Peking you can expect to spend about \u00a55,500 Chinese Yuan Renminbi (CNY/RMB) per month on living expenses. A rough estimate of living costs is as follows:     Accommodation: \u00a51000-1500 CNY per month   Living expenses: \u00a51000-1500 CNY per month   Insurance: \u00a550 per month   Books: \u00a5800-1,000 per year   Public transport: \u00a51200 CNY per month (unless you live outside of Beijing)     The cost of everyday goods and services in Beijing is generally lower than in New York. If you plan to do any traveling around the country or Asia while in China, you will want to budget for those expenses as well.     Housing   There are different types of housing facilities for international students at PKU. Shaoyuan Accommodation Office is in charge of the Housing on campus for Foreign Students. For reservations and related information, please contact the office directly. Phone No.: 86-10-6275 2264, 86-10-62757361. Students can also choose to live off campus, but must register to the local police station.     Passport and Visa Requirements   A valid passport and visa are required to enter and exit China and must be obtained from Chinese Embassies and Consulates before traveling to China. Americans arriving without valid passports and the appropriate Chinese visa are not permitted to enter and will be subject to a fine and immediate deportation at the traveler's expense. Travelers should not rely on Chinese host organizations claiming to be able to arrange a visa upon arrival.   Chinese authorities have recently tightened their visa issuance policy, in some cases requiring personal interviews of American citizens. Although a bilateral United States-China agreement provides for issuance of multiple-entry visas with validity of up to one year for tourists and business visitors, Chinese consulates often limit visas to only one entry. Visit the Embassy of China website for the most current visa information.     Access for Persons with Disabilities   If you are interested in the program and will need some special assistance due to a disability, please contact the Office of Global Programs who will make contact with PKU to obtain information about the availability of needed services.
