The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is a rigorous program that not only covers fundamental computer science subjects - such as object-oriented programming, computer architecture, and operating systems.   The School of Engineering also offers a BS/MS Program that lets you earn 2 degrees at once . For instance, you can receive a BS in Computer Science and MS in Computer Science, a BS in Computer Engineering and MS in Computer Science, or a BS in Electrical Engineering and MS in Computer Science. Depending on your preparation and objectives, you can complete both degrees in as little as 4 years.   We provide research labs for specialized study in areas such as cybersecurity, a field in which our department has a distinctive strength,with internationally well-known professionals who are active in the cyber security field.

His advisor was Jinyang Li. Congratulations!               2015 NYUAD Annual Hackathon   The fourth Annual NYUAD Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World , organized by Professor Sana Odeh, took place April 10-12. It drew over 100 students from a dozen countries worldwide.    For more news about the hackaton, see here .               ACM Fellow   Juliana Freire has been named a Fellow of ACM for contributions to provenance management research and technology, and computational reproducibility. Congratulations!    See the press release for more information.               ACM Distinguished Scientist   Clark Barrett has been named a 2014 Distinguished Scientist by the ACM. Congratulations!               2015 IEEE Donald G. Fink Award   Theodore Rappaport and his students have been awarded the 2015 IEEE Donald G.

Congratulations!              &lt;&lt;More News&gt;&gt;                    Learning and modeling the circuits that operate life: The Bonneau lab aims to learn large biological networks directly from genomics data (genomics =3D very scalable biology experiments). Our recent work, as part of collaborative teams of systems biologists and  computational biologists, has recently resulted in genome-wide models that are capable of simulating the functioning of the genome in real time (Bonneau, et. al, 2006, Cell). Dr. Bonneau's lab develops new algorithms that attempt to learn the regulatory networks (their topology and dynamical parameters) that are at the core of biological systems. This work was featured in a 2008 Discover Article, where Dr. Bonneau was selected as one of the top 20 scientists under 40. This work is collaborative work that relies on NYU's local expertise in Machine Learning, Modeling complex systems and their dynamics, and Genomics.

This work represents songs in terms of \"music phonemes\", elementary units of music sound that are learned from data, and uses weighted finite-state transducers to construct a compact and efficient index of a large database of songs. The image depicts an example of such a transducer. As a result, songs can be recognized quickly and accurately when only a recording of a short \"audio snippet\" is available and even when the recording is distorted. The group has created a working system with a database of 15,000 songs. Moreover, it has proven new bounds on the size of the indexing finite automata used that guarantee the compactness of this representation as the number of songs indexed increases and suggests that their techniques scale to much larger song data sets.
