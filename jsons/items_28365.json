Throughout history, architects and designers have sought to enhance and re-engineer the way people perceive the built environment through the injection of new media elements into everyday interactions. This course will cover the classics of urban design, social dynamics of small urban spaces, and emerging media techniques for transforming these spaces. The course culminates in a final project where students develop \"patterns\" for digital mediation of urban spaces based upon their investigations. Following Christopher Alexander's book \"A Pattern Language,\" these patterns will seek to identify over-arching commonalities among components of digitally mediated environments in contemporary cities. The project will highlight both the new and traditional/timeless qualities of digitally mediated urban spaces.
