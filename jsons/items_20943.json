Description       In this course we will examine how global processes such as economic restructuring, development, shifts in education, rising unemployment, civil conflict, and social movements shape young people\u2019s experiences in different parts of the world. Conversely, we will also investigate how \u201cyouth\u201d can be a lens to rethink and even re-theorize global processes. In our readings and discussion we will map out the geographies of difference, connection, and solidarity between students at Gallatin and youth across the globe, especially in South Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Throughout the course we will read scholarly texts and ethnographies as well as study cultural materials such as fiction, policy documents, and film. Students will develop research and writing skills through a range of assignments including group presentations, short essays, and a culminating research essay. In the final research essay, students will draw from multiple sources to develop scholarly expertise on one key contemporary issue youth are facing today. This will be a multi-step research assignment in which students will hone skills in constructing a research question, building a scholarly annotated bibliography, and developing an argumentative position with supporting evidence.

Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther . Will not bring back articles with the term Brazil .                   Comments (0)                                         Advanced Searching Techniques                 Most databases support these techniques, but sometimes the syntax or symbol used varies. If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

Profiles include political and economic information as well as statistics and information on religion, media and press, and more. EIU Country Reports Each report examines and explains countries' current circumstances, including the political scene, economic policy, domestic economy, sectoral trends, and foreign trade and payments.

CIAO: Columbia International Affairs Online Columbia International Affairs Online (CIAO) is designed to be the most comprehensive source for theory and research in international affairs. It publishes a wide range of scholarship from 1991 on that includes working papers from university research institutes, occasional papers series from NGOs, foundation-funded research projects, and proceedings from conferences. Each section of CIAO is updated with new material on a regular schedule. Working papers are augmented every month, as are conference proceedings, policy briefs and economic indicators. Links and resources, the schedule of events and the response files are updated weekly. New journal issues and books are added as they become available. World Bank Country Profiles With an emphasis on developing countries, this site provides brief country profiles, data, information on major projects underway, and links to full text reports on issues and topics affecting the country in question. Provides a portrait of the economic and social development of each country. CIA World Factbook Provides information on the history, people, government, economy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities. Research Guide: Global Affairs Use this guide to delve deeper into global affairs - including political and economic information.            Comments (0)                                         Limiting to \"Peer Reviewed\" Articles                 \"Peer reviewed\" (or \"refereed\" journals) are those that subject content to a critical review by other experts in the field prior to accepting a manuscript for publication. Thus, limiting your literature search to the peer-reviewed journals ensures a higher level of scholarship and research methodology. Magazines, trade journals, and newspapers tend to be \"non-peer-reviewed,\" meaning perhaps just the editor or someone who is not an expert in the field has reviewed the content before publishing. How do you know if a journal citation is from a peer-reviewed journal?     You can do a journal title search in Ulrich's Global Serials Directory . The symbol: indicates a journal is \"refereed\"   You can look for the \"Limits\" feature in many databases to narrow search results by publication type.    Limiting to \"peer reviewed\" and other publication types in health sciences databases link here .
