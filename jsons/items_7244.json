Description       In this course students will learn methods for making imaginative and engaging performances from a variety of literary sources. Through a journey of text analysis we will create performances inspired by a variety of sources including short stories, poems, newspaper articles, interviews, and essays. This course will introduce students to the basic tools of literary and performance analysis, adaptation, and devised theater techniques. Readings may include texts by Italo Calvino, Jorge Luis Borges, Philip K. Dick, T.S. Eliot, Madeline L\u2019Engle, George Orwell, as well as excerpts from newspaper articles or scientific journals. Techniques for the creation of solo performance as well as small and large group collaboration will also be introduced. Students with an interest in a variety of arts practices (theater, dance, music, visual arts, media arts, etc.) are encouraged to participate; no previous experience necessary.
