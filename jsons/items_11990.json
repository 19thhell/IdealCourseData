The widely accepted and validated \u201cAlcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) is too lengthy for the typical medical visit, and greatly under-utilized as a result. The study will adapt the ASSIST, which was designed and validated to be administered as an in-person interview, to an audio guided computer-assisted self interview (ACASI) that patients can complete prior to their medical visit.   \u00a0      Return to Top      Sundar Natarajan         Title   VALOR (Veterans Affairs Lowering Readmissions) in Heart Failure Study   Principal Investigator(s)   Sundar Natarajan   Funding Agency   Veterans Affairs Health Services &amp; Research Development Service   Project Dates   7/1/2009 - 6/30/2012    Description:   In this study, we will evaluate a quality improvement program (QIP) to improve heart failure (HF) care using a pretest-posttest control group design. This interdisciplinary theory-based prospective experimental study will target improving HF treatment using a patient-based behavioral and checklist intervention, as well as provider and system-targeted checklists and treatment defaults in the posttest or intervention phase; this will be compared to current best practice (CBP) evaluated in the pretest or pre-intervention phase.   \u00a0      Return to Top      Olugbenga Ogedegbe         Title   Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research   Principal Investigator(s)   Olugbenga Ogedegbe   Funding Agency   NIH/NHLBI   Project Dates   12/15/2011 - 11/30/2016    Description:   Support from this K24 award will give Dr. Ogedegbe the dedicated time to enhance his research activities; recruit and mentor new clinician-investigators at NYU School of Medicine in clinical research related to translational behavioral medicine and health disparities in cardiovascular diseases.   \u00a0      Return to Top         Title   NYU/UG Cardiovascular Research Training Institute Program (CaRT)   Principal Investigator(s)   Olugbenga Ogedegbe   Funding Agency   NIH/Fogarty International Center   Project Dates   9/5/2011 - 7/31/2016    Description:   Our initiative will address a critical deficiency of scientists committed to careers in cardiovascular research. Successful completion of CaRT will lead to the establishment of a sustainable cardiovascular research capacity in Ghana and the provision of a steady flow of innovative and contextualized cardiovascular research projects targeted at hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and stroke prevention. At the end of the funding period, we will establish of a network of 40 investigators with expertise in cardiovascular research and we expect to have developed training and mentoring curriculum that can be replicated in a variety of low resource settings in Sub-Saharan Africa.   \u00a0      Return to Top         Title   NHLBI Diversity Supplement for Adetutu Adekoya on parent grant Faith-based Approaches to Treat Hypertension (FAITH)   Principal Investigator(s)   Olugbenga Ogedegbe   Funding Agency   NIH/NHLBI   Project Dates   8/1/2011 - 7/31/2012    Description:   This is a post baccalaureate supplement to the parent NHLBI-funded project R01 HL092860-01A1 Faith based Approaches in the Treatment of Hypertension (FAITH).

Thrombolytic revascularization treatment administered within a maximum of 3 hours from symptom onset reduces morbidity, mortality and cost; however, only 3% of patients arrive at the hospital within 3 hours, mostly due to the public's lack of knowledge concerning stroke symptoms and the appropriate response when they are recognized, which is to call 911. We propose to reduce these delays using a novel behavioral intervention to improve symptom recognition and response in a high-risk, minority, economically disadvantaged population.   \u00a0      Return to Top         Title   Practice-based Trial of Blood Pressure Control in African Americans   Principal Investigator(s)   Olugbenga Ogedegbe   Funding Agency   NIH/NHLBI   Project Dates   9/30/2009 - 7/31/2012    Description:   The goal of this study is to test the effectiveness of a practice-based comprehensive therapeutic lifestyle intervention, delivered through group-based counseling and motivational interviewing in a two-arm, randomized controlled trial in 500 poorly controlled hypertensive African-Americans, who receive care in community-based primary care practices.   \u00a0      Return to Top         Title   Comparative Effectiveness of ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers for African Americans   Principal Investigator(s)   Olugbenga Ogedegbe   Funding Agency   Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)   Project Dates   9/30/2009 - 7/31/2012    Description:   Despite their proven efficacy in lowering blood pressure, ACE inhibitors may not provide the same benefits in African Americans as in Caucasians.

The study PI has gained access to 1,200 such physicians through his recent study of uncontrolled hypertension in men who patronize Black-owned barbershops. Using this unique physician database, he will first survey representative samples of these community physicians to pinpoint the key informational and motivational barriers to antihypertensive drug titration, and second, to develop and test the effectiveness of a novel behavior theory-based intervention to overcome these barriers and reduce physician inertia.   \u00a0      Return to Top      Antoinette Schoenthaler         Title   Racial Differences in Patient-Provider Communication and Medication Adherence   Principal Investigator(s)   Antoinette Schoenthaler   Funding Agency   NIH/NHLBI   Project Dates   9/1/2010 - 6/30/2015    Description:   \"The goal of this career development award is to develop theoretical and methodological expertise in patient-provider communication to facilitate the candidate's development into a leader in research to improve patient-provider communication with an emphasis on its relation to health disparities in patients with chronic disease.\"   \u00a0      Return to Top      Mark Schwartz         Title   Physician Faculty Development in Primary Care   Principal Investigator(s)   Mark Schwartz   Funding Agency   HRSA/ Bureau of Health Professions   Project Dates   9/1/2010 - 8/31/2015    Description:   This funding will build upon our previous HRSA-supported Faculty Development Program (FDP) in Primary Care (PC) at NYU to train a new cohort of clinician educators as expert teachers and leaders in PC.   \u00a0      Return to Top         Title   PROVE: Program for Research on the Outcomes of VA Education   Principal Investigator(s)   Mark Schwartz / Scott Sherman   Funding Agency   Veterans Affairs Health Services &amp;

The widely accepted and validated \u201cAlcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) is too lengthy for the typical medical visit, and greatly under-utilized as a result.

Thrombolytic revascularization treatment administered within a maximum of 3 hours from symptom onset reduces morbidity, mortality and cost; however, only 3% of patients arrive at the hospital within 3 hours, mostly due to the public's lack of knowledge concerning stroke symptoms and the appropriate response when they are recognized, which is to call 911.
