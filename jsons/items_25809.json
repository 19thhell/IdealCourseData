This payment option allows you to pay your student account balance in a number of currencies, provides a secure way of initiating payments electronically and incorporates pertinent student information to ensure timely crediting of the payment to the student&rsquo;s bill. NYU and Western Union do not charge a fee for this service; however, you may incur wire transfer fees from your financial institution.    If you want to wire transfer a payment from a U.S. bank account, you may also use this Western Union service; however, we recommend using eCheck in eSuite because it is a less costly and more efficient method for payments from U.S. bank accounts.
