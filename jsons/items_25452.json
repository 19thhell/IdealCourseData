Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.   \u00a0   \u2028Course Description Currently, across most US radiation therapy treatment centers, breast treatment is performed in the supine position. Technically, prone radiation therapy is complex, requiring expertise in patient immobilization, table design, simulation and treatment. \u00a0At NYU, we have over 14 years of experience in treating patients in the prone position. \u00a0Although this course has been offered a number of times over the past several years, there are still a great number of clinicians who are not treating in the prone position and who need to be educated in this modality.   The\u00a0 NYU Prone Breast Radiotherapy Technique \u00a0course will provide an overview of the rationale for and practical, \u201chands-on\u201d teaching of the NYU prone treatment technique. \u00a0The NYU Radiation Oncology protocols, which utilize IMRT planning techniques for both partial, whole breast and nodal treatment in the prone position, will be described. \u00a0In addition, the organ dose exposure to heart and lung will be outlined.   The course will be structured over 2 days, the first of which will include didactic lectures on the protocols utilized and methodology, while the second day sessions will include hands-on teaching of techniques with ample time for questions and answers, demonstrations and real-time application of learned methodologies of prone breast treatment.   \u00a0   Target Audience The course is targeted at radiation oncologists, physicists and therapists interested in learning the prone technique for external beam breast cancer radiation therapy. \u00a0   \u00a0   Refund Policy In order to request a refund, you must \u00a0 click here \u00a0 to complete and submit our online refund form no later than 14 days prior to the first day of the course.

This course will survey a diverse range of approaches, including not only innovations in rhythm, meter, & form but also more broadly ideas about continuity, the direction of time, & the shifting roles of history & memory in constructing models of temporal experience in a variety of 20th century compositional styles. Some basic connections to recent work in the philosophy of time will also be explored.

Minimalism poses particular challenges to the discipline of musical analysis; the course will introduce various models that have been proposed to study features of the repertoire, & develop others. Yet this is very much a ?hands-on? course; we will be performing as well as listening & analyzing.

In addition, while pitch has long remained the focus of theoretical modeling, new theories of rhythm, form, and timbre have brought increasing sophistication to our understanding of these subdisciplines. This course will provide students with the background to explore a broad spectrum of  recent work in music theory and analysis.

While the music of the turn of the 20th century continues to hold immense fascination for us, the understanding of that music has continued to be a source of controversy in music theory. Different ideas about the relationship between ?late tonality? & ?early tonality? continue to be developed, many of which emphasize continuity rather than rupture. We shall explore these issues through careful study of selected transitional works of the late 19th and early 20th century, including music by Strauss, Schoenberg, Scriabin, Debussy, & others.
