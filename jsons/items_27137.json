The NYU Master of Public Health program requires that students in all three concentrations - Community and International Public Health, Public Health Nutrition, and Global Health Leadership - complete a culminating experience consisting of hands-on fieldwork experience. Students in the Community &amp; International Health and Public Health Nutrition are required to complete Internship and Seminar in Public Health for their culminating experience. Students in the Global Health Leadership concentration are required to complete Capstone for their culminating experience (see the Capstone Guide for Students for details). While the requirements vary depending upon which concentration a student is pursuing, for all MPH students, public health fieldwork provides students the opportunity to become familiar with the kinds of organizations that put into practice the theory, concepts, and methods taught in the NYU MPH program.   In addition, all MPH students, as well as any NYU graduate student, can explore public health leadership in action and enhance their practical skills by taking the elective course: Practicum in Global Health Leadership.   To learn more about the Internship and Seminar in Public Health and Practicum in Global Health Leadership courses, students should refer to the Fieldwork Guide.   In addition, we encourage public health agencies to explore the Information for Organizations section to learn how they might collaborate with the NYU MPH program in offering unique and challenging opportunities for our students.

The NYU Master of Public Health program requires that students in all three concentrations - Community and International Public Health, Public Health Nutrition, and Global Health Leadership - complete a culminating experience consisting of hands-on fieldwork experience. Students in the Community &amp; International Health and Public Health Nutrition are required to complete Internship and Seminar in Public Health for their culminating experience. Students in the Global Health Leadership concentration are required to complete Capstone for their culminating experience (see the Capstone Guide for Students for details). While the requirements vary depending upon which concentration a student is pursuing, for all MPH students, public health fieldwork provides students the opportunity to become familiar with the kinds of organizations that put into practice the theory, concepts, and methods taught in the NYU MPH program.   In addition, all MPH students, as well as any NYU graduate student, can explore public health leadership in action and enhance their practical skills by taking the elective course: Practicum in Global Health Leadership.   To learn more about the Internship and Seminar in Public Health and Practicum in Global Health Leadership courses, students should refer to the Fieldwork Guide.   In addition, we encourage public health agencies to explore the Information for Organizations section to learn how they might collaborate with the NYU MPH program in offering unique and challenging opportunities for our students.

With the assistance of advisers and other members of the Center, students will make contacts with medical or environmental institutions to arrange a practicum, including the starting date, frequency of meetings, and duration. Examples of practicum: i) \u201cshadowing\u201d a hospital palliative care physician or team and examining moral and epistemic issues of assessing patients\u2019 pain, prognoses, and needs to be transferred to hospice care in the hospital or home; ii) assisting in a green\u2010roof promotion project in a city neighborhood and investigating citizens\u2019 individual and collective environmental health responsibilities and related educational efforts. By the end of the Practicum, students will have hands\u2010on experience with real\u2010life ethical issues arising out of medical and environmental settings and will learn about how to think through these issues by applying knowledge acquired from the other courses in the MA program. Practicum Sites: Students looking for practicum opportunities are strongly advised to periodically consult the internship blog which can be found at http://blogs.nyu.edu/fas/bioethics . The blog lists various paid and unpaid opportunities that satisfy the practica requirements. For a list of previous practicum sites, visit http://bioethics.as.nyu.edu/object/bioethics.practicumsites . All sites must be approved by the practicum adviser before a commitment is made to the site supervisor. Once the practicum site is finalized, students are expected to complete a practicum prospectus form and submit it to their adviser. Note: Students are allowed to participate in paid practica positions permitting that the practicum is approved by their program advisers and not within the NYU Center for Bioethics. REQUIREMENTS: Practicum Hours: Students enrolled in the practicum course for 2 points are required to complete a weekly minimum of 3\u20104 hours at their practicum site. Students who enroll in 4 points are required to complete a weekly minimum of 5\u20106 hours at their practicum site. Note: Students may begin to acquire practicum hours BEFORE the semester in which they wish to submit their final Practicum Essay for examination. Also, students are advised officially to register for the Practicum Course the semester they wish to submit their Final Practicum Essay for examination. Biweekly Short Reports: As the practicum progresses, students are required to submit to their advisers short reports every two weeks, detailing their experiences at the practicum site, in particular, ethical issues that they have encountered.Practicum Seminar:Students are required to attend two seminars during the semester in which they plan to complete their practicum. In the first seminar, students will share and discuss their experiences and findings thus far with their fellow practicum students. Students will be asked to a) identify an actual ethical issue that they have encountered that is of interest; b) provide analysis of the issue and c) explain how they have responded to the issue. In the second seminar, students will present work\u2010in\u2010progress material that will form the basis of their final practicum essay. Final Practicum Essay: As the practicum progresses, students, in consultation with their advisers, will decide whether their practicum is suitable to be written up as a single extended Master\u2019s essay (c. 12\u201015,000words). Suitability is determined by whether the ethical issues encountered in the practicum are of sufficient theoretical interest. If the practicum proves not to lend itself to this elaboration, then in consultation with their advisers, students can choose either a)to develop an essay from a prior course in the light of critical commentaries and further reading and thought; or b)to write a new essay. In either case, the essay should be c. 10,000 words. Students who opt for either of these two options will also be responsible for submitting a shorter, final summary of their practicum work (c. 5000 words). All students are required to submit an abstract (250\u2010500 words maximum), which may be posted on the Bioethics webpage. ASSESSMENT: This is a Pass/Fail course. A grade of \u2018Pass\u2019 is given to students who meet the requirements stated above and perform to the satisfaction of the site supervisor. Students, in consultation with their advisers, will determine a schedule of when to submit the Biweekly Short Reports to their advisers. Students will submit a draft of their essay at least two weeks before the Last Day of Classes for those planning to graduate that semester. Students will then submit a final draft of their essay on the Last Day of Classes . During the Final Exam Period , students are expected to give a final oral presentation to their adviser and one other faculty reader. They will meet with the student to discuss the final essay and either accept it or ask for revisions before the grade deadline.
