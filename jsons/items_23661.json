A comprehensive list of policies and procedures can be found in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin, however below we have included those most relevant to students in the NYU MPH program. Any questions regarding program policies should be directed to the program office at 212-992-6741.                                                      Academic Integrity                               The NYU Master of Public Health program values both open inquiry and academic integrity. Student in the program are expected to follow standards of excellence set forth by New York University. Such standards include respect, honesty and responsibility. The program does not tolerate violations to academic integrity including:     Plagiarism   Cheating on an exam   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Collaborating with other students for work expected to be completed individually   Giving your work to another student to submit as his/her own   Purchasing or using papers or work online or from a commercial firm and presenting it as your own work       Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the Program and University\u2019s policy on academic integrity as they will be expected to adhere to such policies at all times \u2013 as a student and an alumni of New York University.   Plagiarism   Plagiarism, whether intended or not, is not tolerated in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Plagiarism involves presenting ideas and/or words without acknowledging the source and includes any of the following acts[1]:     Using a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks   Paraphrasing a passage from another writer's work without attribution   Presenting facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet as your own   Submitting another student's work with your name on it   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are responsible for understanding what constitutes plagiarism. All students are asked to sign a pledge of academic integrity during orientation. Students are encouraged to discuss specific questions with faculty instructors and to utilize the many resources available at New York University.   Disciplinary Sanctions   When a professor suspects cheating, plagiarism, and/or other forms of academic dishonesty, appropriate disciplinary action is as follows:     The Professor will meet with the student to discuss, and present evidence for the particular violation, giving the student opportunity to refute or deny the charge(s).   If the Professor confirms that violation(s), he/she, in consultation with the Program Director and may take any of the following actions:     Allow the student to redo the assignment   Lower the grade for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the course   Recommend dismissal         Once an action(s) is taken, the Professor will inform the Program Director and the Administrative Director, and inform the student in writing, instructing the student to schedule an appointment with the Executive Vice President for Health, as a final step. The student has the right to appeal the action taken in accordance with the program\u2019s Student Complaint Procedure as outlined in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin.       1 Adapted from the Expository Writing Program, \u201cStatement on Academic Integrity\u201d, undated, www.nyu.edu/cas/ewp/.                                                              Academic Progress                               A cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 is required for graduation in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Students are expected to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 throughout their academic career. Students who fall below the required GPA during any semester are placed on academic probation and monitored closely for academic progress. Students who are on academic probation may be restricted in the number of courses taken during a given semester. A student whose GPA falls below the required minimum for 2 consecutive semesters may be asked to withdraw from the program.                                                              Auditing Courses                               In general, auditing courses in the NYU Master of Public Health program is not permitted. Exceptions will be considered on rare occasion, with a written request. In all cases, instructor approval and program director approval must be granted. Audited courses incur the same tuition as the course taken for credit. Please note that no credit will be given or letter grade recorded, no withdrawals will be honored or refunds granted on courses so audited. Tuition remission may not be applied.                                                              Change of Concentration                               All students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are admitted into one of four areas of concentration. Selection is made at the time of application and is included in University academic records. Approval to change concentration areas after matriculation will be made on a case by case basis. To be considered for a change in concentration, the student must be in good academic standing and meet all of the admissions requirements for that concentration. A Concentration Change Form and application must be completed and returned to the program office for review.                                                              Course Repeat Policy                               Only courses counted toward the MPH degree requirements in which a student receives a C- or lower, must be repeated*. Both the original grade and second grade will be recorded on the student\u2019s transcript, but only the second grade will be included in the calculation of the student\u2019s GPA. If the second grade is lower than the original grade, or if the student does not achieve the minimum grade requirement upon taking the course a second time, under special circumstances, the student may take the course a third time pending permission of both the instructor and advisor.   * see the Minimum Course Grade policy regarding culminating experience courses.                                                                Course Waivers                               MPH students in any concentration may waive the requirement to take certain courses based on the following conditions:   1. This policy applies only to MPH core courses:     Epidemiology   Biostatistics   Health Policy &amp; Management   Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health   Environmental Health   Essentials of Public Health Biology     2. A core course can be waived only by transferring credits from a similar core course taken at an accredited MPH program/school.   3. Transferring credits for core courses taken at another MPH program/school must meet all conditions of the GIPH transfer credit policy:   a. Only 6 transfer credits may count toward MPH core courses.  b. Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of C or better was obtained; (2) the course(s) was taken within the past 5 years; and (3) the course(s) was not counted toward a prior degree.   4. Students with a clinical health background (e.g., MD, MBBS, RN, BSN, DO, DDS, PA, DVM) can waive the Essentials of Public Health Biology course.   5. All requests for a course waiver must be filed in the student\u2019s first semester of enrollment in the program using the Request for Waiver form. Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should also arrange to have an official academic transcript sent; the transcript should show course name, dates taken, and letter grade obtained. Approval of the request will be made by the MPH Program Director.                                                              Credit hours                               The NYU GIPH, in accordance with New York State Education Department, defines a credit (also known as a point) as at least 15 hours (of 50 minutes each) of instruction and at least 30 hours of supplementary assignments.                                                                English Proficiency                               Community and International Heath and Public Health Nutrition concentrations : accepted applicants whose native language is not English are required to take a placement examination, for an additional fee, at New York University\u2019s American Language Institute (ALI) on arrival. Based on the performance on this examination, a student may e required to take noncredit remedial English course work before or while taking regular academic course work.   Global Health Leadership concentration: all accepted applicants are expected to demonstrate English proficiency at the time of matriculation. Any student who shows deficiency in English at the start of the program will be provided with a variety of available resources and will be expected to use those resources on their own time and at their own expense as a means of making adequate academic progress in the program.                                                              Incomplete Grades                               Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are expected to complete all course requirements on time. Under extraordinary circumstances (such as a medical emergency), the temporary grade of IP (incomplete pass) or IF (incomplete fail) may be recorded for a student who is unable to complete course requirements. To receive an incomplete grade, the student should make a formal request using the Incomplete Grade Request form. The form must be signed by both the student and the course instructor. The request will include the reason for the incomplete, the work to be completed, and the final date the work is to be completed.   An incomplete grade must be removed within the time limit set by the instructor, which limit may not exceed six months after the close of the course. Students in the NYU Master of Public Health Program are allowed a maximum of 2 incomplete grades on their transcript at any one time. Students with 9 credits or more of IP, IF, or N on their transcripts at any one time will be considered as not making satisfactory progress in their program of study and will be subject to probation. Students who have three probationary terms or two consecutive probationary terms will be subject to dismissal.                                                              Independent Study                               An independent study may be done in place of a concentration course or general elective. If a student desires independent study, he/she should carefully read the Independent Study form found on our website . The form should be approved and signed by the student, faculty supervisor and the Program Director. It should be noted that independent study requires a minimum of 40 hours of work per point. A maximum of 4 credits of independent study is allowed and can be applied only after 24 credits have been earned.                                                              Leave of Absence                               Students in good standing may request a temporary withdrawal from the program for one or more semesters for illness, national service, or personal reasons. Requests must be made by completing the Leave of Absence form found on our website and submitted to giph.registration@nyu.edu . Leaves of absence do not carry a fee, and students do not have access to University facilities during this period.   Students who receive scholarship from the NYU Master of Public Health program relinquish the scholarship if a leave of absence is taken. They may reapply for program scholarship at the time of readmission.                                                              Maintenance of Matriculation                               To maintain matriculation, students must either (1) be registered for course work during the Fall and Spring semester for at least one credit-bearing course or (2) on approval of the Manager, Registration and Academic Services, be registered for maintenance of matriculation. Maintenance of matriculation carries a fee, which allows the student access to all University facilities. No degree can be awarded to a student who is not matriculated.   Note: students in the NYU Master of Public Health program must complete all degree requirements within 6 years of the initial date of matriculation. The time to complete degree requirements includes any semester(s) for which students took a leave of absence or paid maintenance of matriculation. Students who do not maintain matriculation must apply for readmission and will be reviewed against all new applicants for admission.                                                                 Minimum Course Grades                               The minimum grade required for all courses counted toward the MPH degree, with the exception of the culminating experience, is a C or better.   For the culminating experience courses, students must receive a minimum grade of B. If a student receives less than a B, the course must be repeated. These courses include:     GPH-GU 2360 Internship &amp; Seminar in Public Health (for Community &amp; International Health and Public Health Nutrition students)   GPH-GU 2621/22 Capstone in Global Public Health I &amp; II (for Global Health Leadership students)   GPH-GU 2686 Thesis I: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Development and GPH-GU 2687 Thesis II: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Presentation (for Epidemiology students)                                                                Online Course Policy                               Students matriculated in the MPH program may complete up to 15 credits of core MPH courses toward their MPH degree via online coursework. As with MPH courses offered in-person, students in an online course must obtain a grade of C or higher to have these courses count toward their MPH degree.                                                              Pass/Fail Option                               Matriculated students in the NYU Master of Public Health program do not have the option to take credits toward their degree on a pass/fail basis. The only exception to this policy is those courses that are designated as pass/fail.                                                                Transfer Credit                                 Students enrolled in the MPH program will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 9 credits of approved graduate courses from a CEPH accredited school or program in public health.   Among these 9 transfer credits, only 6 transfer credits may count toward core courses in the MPH program (the core courses include Biostatistics for Public Health, Epidemiology, Health Policy &amp; Management, Environmental Health and Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health).   Individuals who complete MPH coursework at NYU as non-matriculated students will also be permitted to transfer up to 9 credits into the MPH program. Since these MPH courses were completed at NYU, all credits will be accepted irrespective of whether the courses were core or electives courses.   Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of a C or better was obtained; (2) the courses were taken within the last 5 years; and (3) the courses were not counted towards a prior degree.   Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should submit a request in writing to the MPH program director and Academic Dean and should include: (1) an academic transcript showing course name, dates taken, letter grade obtained; and (2) course syllabus.   For those who have taken core courses or successfully completed all of the core courses that comprise the Advanced Certificate in Public Health through GIPH, up to 15 of these credits may be applied toward the MPH degree. As with courses taken outside of NYU, approval of transfer credits from the Advanced Certificate will be approved pending a grade of a C or better and completion of within the past 5 years.

A comprehensive list of policies and procedures can be found in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin, however below we have included those most relevant to students in the NYU MPH program. Any questions regarding program policies should be directed to the program office at 212-992-6741.                                                      Academic Integrity                               The NYU Master of Public Health program values both open inquiry and academic integrity. Student in the program are expected to follow standards of excellence set forth by New York University. Such standards include respect, honesty and responsibility. The program does not tolerate violations to academic integrity including:     Plagiarism   Cheating on an exam   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Collaborating with other students for work expected to be completed individually   Giving your work to another student to submit as his/her own   Purchasing or using papers or work online or from a commercial firm and presenting it as your own work       Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the Program and University\u2019s policy on academic integrity as they will be expected to adhere to such policies at all times \u2013 as a student and an alumni of New York University.   Plagiarism   Plagiarism, whether intended or not, is not tolerated in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Plagiarism involves presenting ideas and/or words without acknowledging the source and includes any of the following acts[1]:     Using a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks   Paraphrasing a passage from another writer's work without attribution   Presenting facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet as your own   Submitting another student's work with your name on it   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are responsible for understanding what constitutes plagiarism. All students are asked to sign a pledge of academic integrity during orientation. Students are encouraged to discuss specific questions with faculty instructors and to utilize the many resources available at New York University.   Disciplinary Sanctions   When a professor suspects cheating, plagiarism, and/or other forms of academic dishonesty, appropriate disciplinary action is as follows:     The Professor will meet with the student to discuss, and present evidence for the particular violation, giving the student opportunity to refute or deny the charge(s).   If the Professor confirms that violation(s), he/she, in consultation with the Program Director and may take any of the following actions:     Allow the student to redo the assignment   Lower the grade for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the course   Recommend dismissal         Once an action(s) is taken, the Professor will inform the Program Director and the Administrative Director, and inform the student in writing, instructing the student to schedule an appointment with the Executive Vice President for Health, as a final step. The student has the right to appeal the action taken in accordance with the program\u2019s Student Complaint Procedure as outlined in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin.       1 Adapted from the Expository Writing Program, \u201cStatement on Academic Integrity\u201d, undated, www.nyu.edu/cas/ewp/.                                                              Academic Progress                               A cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 is required for graduation in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Students are expected to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 throughout their academic career. Students who fall below the required GPA during any semester are placed on academic probation and monitored closely for academic progress. Students who are on academic probation may be restricted in the number of courses taken during a given semester. A student whose GPA falls below the required minimum for 2 consecutive semesters may be asked to withdraw from the program.                                                              Auditing Courses                               In general, auditing courses in the NYU Master of Public Health program is not permitted. Exceptions will be considered on rare occasion, with a written request. In all cases, instructor approval and program director approval must be granted. Audited courses incur the same tuition as the course taken for credit. Please note that no credit will be given or letter grade recorded, no withdrawals will be honored or refunds granted on courses so audited. Tuition remission may not be applied.                                                              Change of Concentration                               All students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are admitted into one of four areas of concentration. Selection is made at the time of application and is included in University academic records. Approval to change concentration areas after matriculation will be made on a case by case basis. To be considered for a change in concentration, the student must be in good academic standing and meet all of the admissions requirements for that concentration. A Concentration Change Form and application must be completed and returned to the program office for review.                                                              Course Repeat Policy                               Only courses counted toward the MPH degree requirements in which a student receives a C- or lower, must be repeated*. Both the original grade and second grade will be recorded on the student\u2019s transcript, but only the second grade will be included in the calculation of the student\u2019s GPA. If the second grade is lower than the original grade, or if the student does not achieve the minimum grade requirement upon taking the course a second time, under special circumstances, the student may take the course a third time pending permission of both the instructor and advisor.   * see the Minimum Course Grade policy regarding culminating experience courses.                                                                Course Waivers                               MPH students in any concentration may waive the requirement to take certain courses based on the following conditions:   1. This policy applies only to MPH core courses:     Epidemiology   Biostatistics   Health Policy &amp; Management   Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health   Environmental Health   Essentials of Public Health Biology     2. A core course can be waived only by transferring credits from a similar core course taken at an accredited MPH program/school.   3. Transferring credits for core courses taken at another MPH program/school must meet all conditions of the GIPH transfer credit policy:   a. Only 6 transfer credits may count toward MPH core courses.  b. Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of C or better was obtained; (2) the course(s) was taken within the past 5 years; and (3) the course(s) was not counted toward a prior degree.   4. Students with a clinical health background (e.g., MD, MBBS, RN, BSN, DO, DDS, PA, DVM) can waive the Essentials of Public Health Biology course.   5. All requests for a course waiver must be filed in the student\u2019s first semester of enrollment in the program using the Request for Waiver form. Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should also arrange to have an official academic transcript sent; the transcript should show course name, dates taken, and letter grade obtained. Approval of the request will be made by the MPH Program Director.                                                              Credit hours                               The NYU GIPH, in accordance with New York State Education Department, defines a credit (also known as a point) as at least 15 hours (of 50 minutes each) of instruction and at least 30 hours of supplementary assignments.                                                                English Proficiency                               Community and International Heath and Public Health Nutrition concentrations : accepted applicants whose native language is not English are required to take a placement examination, for an additional fee, at New York University\u2019s American Language Institute (ALI) on arrival. Based on the performance on this examination, a student may e required to take noncredit remedial English course work before or while taking regular academic course work.   Global Health Leadership concentration: all accepted applicants are expected to demonstrate English proficiency at the time of matriculation. Any student who shows deficiency in English at the start of the program will be provided with a variety of available resources and will be expected to use those resources on their own time and at their own expense as a means of making adequate academic progress in the program.                                                              Incomplete Grades                               Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are expected to complete all course requirements on time. Under extraordinary circumstances (such as a medical emergency), the temporary grade of IP (incomplete pass) or IF (incomplete fail) may be recorded for a student who is unable to complete course requirements. To receive an incomplete grade, the student should make a formal request using the Incomplete Grade Request form. The form must be signed by both the student and the course instructor. The request will include the reason for the incomplete, the work to be completed, and the final date the work is to be completed.   An incomplete grade must be removed within the time limit set by the instructor, which limit may not exceed six months after the close of the course. Students in the NYU Master of Public Health Program are allowed a maximum of 2 incomplete grades on their transcript at any one time. Students with 9 credits or more of IP, IF, or N on their transcripts at any one time will be considered as not making satisfactory progress in their program of study and will be subject to probation. Students who have three probationary terms or two consecutive probationary terms will be subject to dismissal.                                                              Independent Study                               An independent study may be done in place of a concentration course or general elective. If a student desires independent study, he/she should carefully read the Independent Study form found on our website . The form should be approved and signed by the student, faculty supervisor and the Program Director. It should be noted that independent study requires a minimum of 40 hours of work per point. A maximum of 4 credits of independent study is allowed and can be applied only after 24 credits have been earned.                                                              Leave of Absence                               Students in good standing may request a temporary withdrawal from the program for one or more semesters for illness, national service, or personal reasons. Requests must be made by completing the Leave of Absence form found on our website and submitted to giph.registration@nyu.edu . Leaves of absence do not carry a fee, and students do not have access to University facilities during this period.   Students who receive scholarship from the NYU Master of Public Health program relinquish the scholarship if a leave of absence is taken. They may reapply for program scholarship at the time of readmission.                                                              Maintenance of Matriculation                               To maintain matriculation, students must either (1) be registered for course work during the Fall and Spring semester for at least one credit-bearing course or (2) on approval of the Manager, Registration and Academic Services, be registered for maintenance of matriculation. Maintenance of matriculation carries a fee, which allows the student access to all University facilities. No degree can be awarded to a student who is not matriculated.   Note: students in the NYU Master of Public Health program must complete all degree requirements within 6 years of the initial date of matriculation. The time to complete degree requirements includes any semester(s) for which students took a leave of absence or paid maintenance of matriculation. Students who do not maintain matriculation must apply for readmission and will be reviewed against all new applicants for admission.                                                                 Minimum Course Grades                               The minimum grade required for all courses counted toward the MPH degree, with the exception of the culminating experience, is a C or better.   For the culminating experience courses, students must receive a minimum grade of B. If a student receives less than a B, the course must be repeated. These courses include:     GPH-GU 2360 Internship &amp; Seminar in Public Health (for Community &amp; International Health and Public Health Nutrition students)   GPH-GU 2621/22 Capstone in Global Public Health I &amp; II (for Global Health Leadership students)   GPH-GU 2686 Thesis I: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Development and GPH-GU 2687 Thesis II: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Presentation (for Epidemiology students)                                                                Online Course Policy                               Students matriculated in the MPH program may complete up to 15 credits of core MPH courses toward their MPH degree via online coursework. As with MPH courses offered in-person, students in an online course must obtain a grade of C or higher to have these courses count toward their MPH degree.                                                              Pass/Fail Option                               Matriculated students in the NYU Master of Public Health program do not have the option to take credits toward their degree on a pass/fail basis. The only exception to this policy is those courses that are designated as pass/fail.                                                                Transfer Credit                                 Students enrolled in the MPH program will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 9 credits of approved graduate courses from a CEPH accredited school or program in public health.   Among these 9 transfer credits, only 6 transfer credits may count toward core courses in the MPH program (the core courses include Biostatistics for Public Health, Epidemiology, Health Policy &amp; Management, Environmental Health and Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health).   Individuals who complete MPH coursework at NYU as non-matriculated students will also be permitted to transfer up to 9 credits into the MPH program. Since these MPH courses were completed at NYU, all credits will be accepted irrespective of whether the courses were core or electives courses.   Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of a C or better was obtained; (2) the courses were taken within the last 5 years; and (3) the courses were not counted towards a prior degree.   Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should submit a request in writing to the MPH program director and Academic Dean and should include: (1) an academic transcript showing course name, dates taken, letter grade obtained; and (2) course syllabus.   For those who have taken core courses or successfully completed all of the core courses that comprise the Advanced Certificate in Public Health through GIPH, up to 15 of these credits may be applied toward the MPH degree. As with courses taken outside of NYU, approval of transfer credits from the Advanced Certificate will be approved pending a grade of a C or better and completion of within the past 5 years.

Some departments require an interview and may require a writing sample. Please be sure to refer to your department's website to confirm all application requirements. A list of most department requirements is provided in Application Requirements and Deadlines for Departments and Programs (PDF).      All official notifications of admission decisions are made in writing by the dean of the Graduate School. Statements about admission, either expressed or implied (verbally or written) from any other source, are not official and may not be honored.       Application Fee Waivers   In almost all cases GSAS does not waive or defer the admissions application fee.      GSAS does offer a waiver for the admissions application fee under certain limited conditions to applicants who participate in certain programs. Two criteria must be met.      First, applicants who participate in the following programs will be considered for a fee waiver:      AmeriCorps (participation must have occurred between September 2010 and the present)    Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS)    California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CAMP)    CUNY Pipeline Program    Gates Millennium Scholar Program (GMS)    Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers (IRT)    The Leadership Alliance    The McNair Scholars Program    Mellon-Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program (MMUF)    NIH Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Education Experiences (ENDURE)    NYU Center for Neural Science Summer Undergraduate Research Program    Peace Corps    Project 1000    Society for Advancement of Hispanics/Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS)    Summer Institute for Literary and Cultural Studies (SICLS)    U.S. military            Second, if you participate in one of those programs, then you must also meet all of the following standards to be considered for an application fee waiver:       You must be applying to a master\u2019s or doctoral program of study in GSAS.    You must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher.    You must apply for the fee waiver BEFORE submitting your application for admission. We are not able to refund the application fee if you choose to pay the fee before a waiver is approved. Apply for the fee waiver as early as possible, but no later than four weeks before the application deadline for your program.         If you meet both the first and second criteria stated above, then please contact    gsas.admissions@nyu.edu for specific instructions on how to apply for the fee waiver. In your email, be sure to:      Indicate that you have read this policies web page.   Name the program in which you participated from the list in the first criterion.   State how you meet each of the three standards stated in the second criterion.            Please note that we do not offer application fee waivers for other circumstances.       Multiple Applications   You must choose only one department and field of study and may submit only one application for consideration in a given term. If you submit more than one application for a term, all applications submitted after the first one will be held and will not be considered for admission. Thus, determine carefully the one program to which you will apply.      Applicants are permitted to submit admissions applications to two (or more) programs if they are within different schools at NYU. For example,   you may apply to a program in the Graduate School of Arts and Science and to a different program at the Steinhardt School. However, you may not apply to both Computer Science and Economics at the same time because both are within the Graduate School of Arts and Science. If you choose to apply to programs that are in different schools, it will be necessary to complete and submit separate applications and pay each school a separate application fee. The following NYU graduate schools are separate from the Graduate School of Arts and Science: NYU-Poly, Tisch (Arts), Sackler (Medicine), School of Law, Steinhardt (Culture, Education and Human Development), Stern (Business), Wagner (Public Service), Silver (Social Work) and Gallatin (Individualized Study).      Please note that if you are accepted to more than one school, you may not accept admission to both, unless you have been accepted into a dual-degree program . NYU does not allow enrollment in more than one school simultaneously.          Re-applying for Admission (Previous Applications)   Every year there are applicants who wish to reapply for admission to GSAS and want to know how to do so. These applicants may be:       Applicants who were not offered admission.    Applicants who were offered admission but did not enroll for the term in which they were admitted.    Enrolled students who are applying for admission to a different program.         If you reapply for admission, it will be necessary for you to complete an entire new application, with all new supporting credentials (see test score information in next paragraph). This means you must complete a new online application, pay the application fee, upload academic transcripts, arrange for new letters of recommendation, and submit all other supporting materials that are required as part of your application to the new program.      The only portion of your previous application which is retained are your official test scores. GRE scores are held for five years from the date of the test and TOEFL scores are held for two years from the date of the test. Official test scores are ones that have been sent to GSAS directly from the testing program.      A special note about using the online application: The online application will only allow one application submission per login name within an application cycle (the 2014 application cycle is summer 2014, fall 2014, and spring 2015). For example, if you apply for admission to the fall 2014 term and wish to apply again for the spring 2015 term, you must create a new login name (usually an email address) to the Embark system. However, if you applied for the fall 2014 term, and now wish to apply for the fall 2015 term, you will be able to use your same login name since it is a new application cycle.          Joint and Dual Degree Programs   Applications to joint degree programs are reviewed separately by both departments. Admission to a joint degree program is contingent upon acceptance by both departments. If one department does not accept your application for admission to the joint program, the other department, at its discretion, may consider you for admission to the individual department.      Applicants to dual degree programs (programs that are offered by different schools) must apply to each school separately. Applicants must complete the application requirements of each school. Application materials are not shared between schools. Admission to a dual degree program is contingent upon acceptance by both schools.            Non-degree and Visiting Students   Occasionally an applicant will demonstrate a particular need to study at the Graduate School without entering a degree program. A few students are permitted to register each year as non-degree or visiting students. Potential applicants should contact the department before applying to confirm that non-degree or visiting students are considered for admission into the program.      Note: The online application for non-degree study is accepted only from U.S. citizens applying to the non-degree programs in General Biology, Computer Science, Data Science, Math, Math in Finance, Physics, or General Psychology.

A comprehensive list of policies and procedures can be found in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin, however below we have included those most relevant to students in the NYU MPH program. Any questions regarding program policies should be directed to the program office at 212-992-6741.                                                      Academic Integrity                               The NYU Master of Public Health program values both open inquiry and academic integrity. Student in the program are expected to follow standards of excellence set forth by New York University. Such standards include respect, honesty and responsibility. The program does not tolerate violations to academic integrity including:     Plagiarism   Cheating on an exam   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Collaborating with other students for work expected to be completed individually   Giving your work to another student to submit as his/her own   Purchasing or using papers or work online or from a commercial firm and presenting it as your own work       Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the Program and University\u2019s policy on academic integrity as they will be expected to adhere to such policies at all times \u2013 as a student and an alumni of New York University.   Plagiarism   Plagiarism, whether intended or not, is not tolerated in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Plagiarism involves presenting ideas and/or words without acknowledging the source and includes any of the following acts[1]:     Using a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks   Paraphrasing a passage from another writer's work without attribution   Presenting facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet as your own   Submitting another student's work with your name on it   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are responsible for understanding what constitutes plagiarism. All students are asked to sign a pledge of academic integrity during orientation. Students are encouraged to discuss specific questions with faculty instructors and to utilize the many resources available at New York University.   Disciplinary Sanctions   When a professor suspects cheating, plagiarism, and/or other forms of academic dishonesty, appropriate disciplinary action is as follows:     The Professor will meet with the student to discuss, and present evidence for the particular violation, giving the student opportunity to refute or deny the charge(s).   If the Professor confirms that violation(s), he/she, in consultation with the Program Director and may take any of the following actions:     Allow the student to redo the assignment   Lower the grade for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the course   Recommend dismissal         Once an action(s) is taken, the Professor will inform the Program Director and the Administrative Director, and inform the student in writing, instructing the student to schedule an appointment with the Executive Vice President for Health, as a final step. The student has the right to appeal the action taken in accordance with the program\u2019s Student Complaint Procedure as outlined in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin.       1 Adapted from the Expository Writing Program, \u201cStatement on Academic Integrity\u201d, undated, www.nyu.edu/cas/ewp/.                                                              Academic Progress                               A cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 is required for graduation in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Students are expected to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 throughout their academic career. Students who fall below the required GPA during any semester are placed on academic probation and monitored closely for academic progress. Students who are on academic probation may be restricted in the number of courses taken during a given semester. A student whose GPA falls below the required minimum for 2 consecutive semesters may be asked to withdraw from the program.                                                              Auditing Courses                               In general, auditing courses in the NYU Master of Public Health program is not permitted. Exceptions will be considered on rare occasion, with a written request. In all cases, instructor approval and program director approval must be granted. Audited courses incur the same tuition as the course taken for credit. Please note that no credit will be given or letter grade recorded, no withdrawals will be honored or refunds granted on courses so audited. Tuition remission may not be applied.                                                              Change of Concentration                               All students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are admitted into one of four areas of concentration. Selection is made at the time of application and is included in University academic records. Approval to change concentration areas after matriculation will be made on a case by case basis. To be considered for a change in concentration, the student must be in good academic standing and meet all of the admissions requirements for that concentration. A Concentration Change Form and application must be completed and returned to the program office for review.                                                              Course Repeat Policy                               Only courses counted toward the MPH degree requirements in which a student receives a C- or lower, must be repeated*. Both the original grade and second grade will be recorded on the student\u2019s transcript, but only the second grade will be included in the calculation of the student\u2019s GPA. If the second grade is lower than the original grade, or if the student does not achieve the minimum grade requirement upon taking the course a second time, under special circumstances, the student may take the course a third time pending permission of both the instructor and advisor.   * see the Minimum Course Grade policy regarding culminating experience courses.                                                                Course Waivers                               MPH students in any concentration may waive the requirement to take certain courses based on the following conditions:   1. This policy applies only to MPH core courses:     Epidemiology   Biostatistics   Health Policy &amp; Management   Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health   Environmental Health   Essentials of Public Health Biology     2. A core course can be waived only by transferring credits from a similar core course taken at an accredited MPH program/school.   3. Transferring credits for core courses taken at another MPH program/school must meet all conditions of the GIPH transfer credit policy:   a. Only 6 transfer credits may count toward MPH core courses.  b. Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of C or better was obtained; (2) the course(s) was taken within the past 5 years; and (3) the course(s) was not counted toward a prior degree.   4. Students with a clinical health background (e.g., MD, MBBS, RN, BSN, DO, DDS, PA, DVM) can waive the Essentials of Public Health Biology course.   5. All requests for a course waiver must be filed in the student\u2019s first semester of enrollment in the program using the Request for Waiver form. Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should also arrange to have an official academic transcript sent; the transcript should show course name, dates taken, and letter grade obtained. Approval of the request will be made by the MPH Program Director.                                                              Credit hours                               The NYU GIPH, in accordance with New York State Education Department, defines a credit (also known as a point) as at least 15 hours (of 50 minutes each) of instruction and at least 30 hours of supplementary assignments.                                                                English Proficiency                               Community and International Heath and Public Health Nutrition concentrations : accepted applicants whose native language is not English are required to take a placement examination, for an additional fee, at New York University\u2019s American Language Institute (ALI) on arrival. Based on the performance on this examination, a student may e required to take noncredit remedial English course work before or while taking regular academic course work.   Global Health Leadership concentration: all accepted applicants are expected to demonstrate English proficiency at the time of matriculation. Any student who shows deficiency in English at the start of the program will be provided with a variety of available resources and will be expected to use those resources on their own time and at their own expense as a means of making adequate academic progress in the program.                                                              Incomplete Grades                               Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are expected to complete all course requirements on time. Under extraordinary circumstances (such as a medical emergency), the temporary grade of IP (incomplete pass) or IF (incomplete fail) may be recorded for a student who is unable to complete course requirements. To receive an incomplete grade, the student should make a formal request using the Incomplete Grade Request form. The form must be signed by both the student and the course instructor. The request will include the reason for the incomplete, the work to be completed, and the final date the work is to be completed.   An incomplete grade must be removed within the time limit set by the instructor, which limit may not exceed six months after the close of the course. Students in the NYU Master of Public Health Program are allowed a maximum of 2 incomplete grades on their transcript at any one time. Students with 9 credits or more of IP, IF, or N on their transcripts at any one time will be considered as not making satisfactory progress in their program of study and will be subject to probation. Students who have three probationary terms or two consecutive probationary terms will be subject to dismissal.                                                              Independent Study                               An independent study may be done in place of a concentration course or general elective. If a student desires independent study, he/she should carefully read the Independent Study form found on our website . The form should be approved and signed by the student, faculty supervisor and the Program Director. It should be noted that independent study requires a minimum of 40 hours of work per point. A maximum of 4 credits of independent study is allowed and can be applied only after 24 credits have been earned.                                                              Leave of Absence                               Students in good standing may request a temporary withdrawal from the program for one or more semesters for illness, national service, or personal reasons. Requests must be made by completing the Leave of Absence form found on our website and submitted to giph.registration@nyu.edu . Leaves of absence do not carry a fee, and students do not have access to University facilities during this period.   Students who receive scholarship from the NYU Master of Public Health program relinquish the scholarship if a leave of absence is taken. They may reapply for program scholarship at the time of readmission.                                                              Maintenance of Matriculation                               To maintain matriculation, students must either (1) be registered for course work during the Fall and Spring semester for at least one credit-bearing course or (2) on approval of the Manager, Registration and Academic Services, be registered for maintenance of matriculation. Maintenance of matriculation carries a fee, which allows the student access to all University facilities. No degree can be awarded to a student who is not matriculated.   Note: students in the NYU Master of Public Health program must complete all degree requirements within 6 years of the initial date of matriculation. The time to complete degree requirements includes any semester(s) for which students took a leave of absence or paid maintenance of matriculation. Students who do not maintain matriculation must apply for readmission and will be reviewed against all new applicants for admission.                                                                 Minimum Course Grades                               The minimum grade required for all courses counted toward the MPH degree, with the exception of the culminating experience, is a C or better.   For the culminating experience courses, students must receive a minimum grade of B. If a student receives less than a B, the course must be repeated. These courses include:     GPH-GU 2360 Internship &amp; Seminar in Public Health (for Community &amp; International Health and Public Health Nutrition students)   GPH-GU 2621/22 Capstone in Global Public Health I &amp; II (for Global Health Leadership students)   GPH-GU 2686 Thesis I: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Development and GPH-GU 2687 Thesis II: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Presentation (for Epidemiology students)                                                                Online Course Policy                               Students matriculated in the MPH program may complete up to 15 credits of core MPH courses toward their MPH degree via online coursework. As with MPH courses offered in-person, students in an online course must obtain a grade of C or higher to have these courses count toward their MPH degree.                                                              Pass/Fail Option                               Matriculated students in the NYU Master of Public Health program do not have the option to take credits toward their degree on a pass/fail basis. The only exception to this policy is those courses that are designated as pass/fail.                                                                Transfer Credit                                 Students enrolled in the MPH program will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 9 credits of approved graduate courses from a CEPH accredited school or program in public health.   Among these 9 transfer credits, only 6 transfer credits may count toward core courses in the MPH program (the core courses include Biostatistics for Public Health, Epidemiology, Health Policy &amp; Management, Environmental Health and Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health).   Individuals who complete MPH coursework at NYU as non-matriculated students will also be permitted to transfer up to 9 credits into the MPH program. Since these MPH courses were completed at NYU, all credits will be accepted irrespective of whether the courses were core or electives courses.   Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of a C or better was obtained; (2) the courses were taken within the last 5 years; and (3) the courses were not counted towards a prior degree.   Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should submit a request in writing to the MPH program director and Academic Dean and should include: (1) an academic transcript showing course name, dates taken, letter grade obtained; and (2) course syllabus.   For those who have taken core courses or successfully completed all of the core courses that comprise the Advanced Certificate in Public Health through GIPH, up to 15 of these credits may be applied toward the MPH degree. As with courses taken outside of NYU, approval of transfer credits from the Advanced Certificate will be approved pending a grade of a C or better and completion of within the past 5 years.

A comprehensive list of policies and procedures can be found in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin, however below we have included those most relevant to students in the NYU MPH program. Any questions regarding program policies should be directed to the program office at 212-992-6741.                                                      Academic Integrity                               The NYU Master of Public Health program values both open inquiry and academic integrity. Student in the program are expected to follow standards of excellence set forth by New York University. Such standards include respect, honesty and responsibility. The program does not tolerate violations to academic integrity including:     Plagiarism   Cheating on an exam   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Collaborating with other students for work expected to be completed individually   Giving your work to another student to submit as his/her own   Purchasing or using papers or work online or from a commercial firm and presenting it as your own work       Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the Program and University\u2019s policy on academic integrity as they will be expected to adhere to such policies at all times \u2013 as a student and an alumni of New York University.   Plagiarism   Plagiarism, whether intended or not, is not tolerated in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Plagiarism involves presenting ideas and/or words without acknowledging the source and includes any of the following acts[1]:     Using a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks   Paraphrasing a passage from another writer's work without attribution   Presenting facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet as your own   Submitting another student's work with your name on it   Submitting your own work toward requirements in more than one course without prior approval from the instructor   Purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill.       Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are responsible for understanding what constitutes plagiarism. All students are asked to sign a pledge of academic integrity during orientation. Students are encouraged to discuss specific questions with faculty instructors and to utilize the many resources available at New York University.   Disciplinary Sanctions   When a professor suspects cheating, plagiarism, and/or other forms of academic dishonesty, appropriate disciplinary action is as follows:     The Professor will meet with the student to discuss, and present evidence for the particular violation, giving the student opportunity to refute or deny the charge(s).   If the Professor confirms that violation(s), he/she, in consultation with the Program Director and may take any of the following actions:     Allow the student to redo the assignment   Lower the grade for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the work in question   Assign a grade of F for the course   Recommend dismissal         Once an action(s) is taken, the Professor will inform the Program Director and the Administrative Director, and inform the student in writing, instructing the student to schedule an appointment with the Executive Vice President for Health, as a final step. The student has the right to appeal the action taken in accordance with the program\u2019s Student Complaint Procedure as outlined in the NYU Master of Public Health Bulletin.       1 Adapted from the Expository Writing Program, \u201cStatement on Academic Integrity\u201d, undated, www.nyu.edu/cas/ewp/.                                                              Academic Progress                               A cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 is required for graduation in the NYU Master of Public Health program. Students are expected to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 throughout their academic career. Students who fall below the required GPA during any semester are placed on academic probation and monitored closely for academic progress. Students who are on academic probation may be restricted in the number of courses taken during a given semester. A student whose GPA falls below the required minimum for 2 consecutive semesters may be asked to withdraw from the program.                                                              Auditing Courses                               In general, auditing courses in the NYU Master of Public Health program is not permitted. Exceptions will be considered on rare occasion, with a written request. In all cases, instructor approval and program director approval must be granted. Audited courses incur the same tuition as the course taken for credit. Please note that no credit will be given or letter grade recorded, no withdrawals will be honored or refunds granted on courses so audited. Tuition remission may not be applied.                                                              Change of Concentration                               All students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are admitted into one of four areas of concentration. Selection is made at the time of application and is included in University academic records. Approval to change concentration areas after matriculation will be made on a case by case basis. To be considered for a change in concentration, the student must be in good academic standing and meet all of the admissions requirements for that concentration. A Concentration Change Form and application must be completed and returned to the program office for review.                                                              Course Repeat Policy                               Only courses counted toward the MPH degree requirements in which a student receives a C- or lower, must be repeated*. Both the original grade and second grade will be recorded on the student\u2019s transcript, but only the second grade will be included in the calculation of the student\u2019s GPA. If the second grade is lower than the original grade, or if the student does not achieve the minimum grade requirement upon taking the course a second time, under special circumstances, the student may take the course a third time pending permission of both the instructor and advisor.   * see the Minimum Course Grade policy regarding culminating experience courses.                                                                Course Waivers                               MPH students in any concentration may waive the requirement to take certain courses based on the following conditions:   1. This policy applies only to MPH core courses:     Epidemiology   Biostatistics   Health Policy &amp; Management   Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health   Environmental Health   Essentials of Public Health Biology     2. A core course can be waived only by transferring credits from a similar core course taken at an accredited MPH program/school.   3. Transferring credits for core courses taken at another MPH program/school must meet all conditions of the GIPH transfer credit policy:   a. Only 6 transfer credits may count toward MPH core courses.  b. Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of C or better was obtained; (2) the course(s) was taken within the past 5 years; and (3) the course(s) was not counted toward a prior degree.   4. Students with a clinical health background (e.g., MD, MBBS, RN, BSN, DO, DDS, PA, DVM) can waive the Essentials of Public Health Biology course.   5. All requests for a course waiver must be filed in the student\u2019s first semester of enrollment in the program using the Request for Waiver form. Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should also arrange to have an official academic transcript sent; the transcript should show course name, dates taken, and letter grade obtained. Approval of the request will be made by the MPH Program Director.                                                              Credit hours                               The NYU GIPH, in accordance with New York State Education Department, defines a credit (also known as a point) as at least 15 hours (of 50 minutes each) of instruction and at least 30 hours of supplementary assignments.                                                                English Proficiency                               Community and International Heath and Public Health Nutrition concentrations : accepted applicants whose native language is not English are required to take a placement examination, for an additional fee, at New York University\u2019s American Language Institute (ALI) on arrival. Based on the performance on this examination, a student may e required to take noncredit remedial English course work before or while taking regular academic course work.   Global Health Leadership concentration: all accepted applicants are expected to demonstrate English proficiency at the time of matriculation. Any student who shows deficiency in English at the start of the program will be provided with a variety of available resources and will be expected to use those resources on their own time and at their own expense as a means of making adequate academic progress in the program.                                                              Incomplete Grades                               Students in the NYU Master of Public Health program are expected to complete all course requirements on time. Under extraordinary circumstances (such as a medical emergency), the temporary grade of IP (incomplete pass) or IF (incomplete fail) may be recorded for a student who is unable to complete course requirements. To receive an incomplete grade, the student should make a formal request using the Incomplete Grade Request form. The form must be signed by both the student and the course instructor. The request will include the reason for the incomplete, the work to be completed, and the final date the work is to be completed.   An incomplete grade must be removed within the time limit set by the instructor, which limit may not exceed six months after the close of the course. Students in the NYU Master of Public Health Program are allowed a maximum of 2 incomplete grades on their transcript at any one time. Students with 9 credits or more of IP, IF, or N on their transcripts at any one time will be considered as not making satisfactory progress in their program of study and will be subject to probation. Students who have three probationary terms or two consecutive probationary terms will be subject to dismissal.                                                              Independent Study                               An independent study may be done in place of a concentration course or general elective. If a student desires independent study, he/she should carefully read the Independent Study form found on our website . The form should be approved and signed by the student, faculty supervisor and the Program Director. It should be noted that independent study requires a minimum of 40 hours of work per point. A maximum of 4 credits of independent study is allowed and can be applied only after 24 credits have been earned.                                                              Leave of Absence                               Students in good standing may request a temporary withdrawal from the program for one or more semesters for illness, national service, or personal reasons. Requests must be made by completing the Leave of Absence form found on our website and submitted to giph.registration@nyu.edu . Leaves of absence do not carry a fee, and students do not have access to University facilities during this period.   Students who receive scholarship from the NYU Master of Public Health program relinquish the scholarship if a leave of absence is taken. They may reapply for program scholarship at the time of readmission.                                                              Maintenance of Matriculation                               To maintain matriculation, students must either (1) be registered for course work during the Fall and Spring semester for at least one credit-bearing course or (2) on approval of the Manager, Registration and Academic Services, be registered for maintenance of matriculation. Maintenance of matriculation carries a fee, which allows the student access to all University facilities. No degree can be awarded to a student who is not matriculated.   Note: students in the NYU Master of Public Health program must complete all degree requirements within 6 years of the initial date of matriculation. The time to complete degree requirements includes any semester(s) for which students took a leave of absence or paid maintenance of matriculation. Students who do not maintain matriculation must apply for readmission and will be reviewed against all new applicants for admission.                                                                 Minimum Course Grades                               The minimum grade required for all courses counted toward the MPH degree, with the exception of the culminating experience, is a C or better.   For the culminating experience courses, students must receive a minimum grade of B. If a student receives less than a B, the course must be repeated. These courses include:     GPH-GU 2360 Internship &amp; Seminar in Public Health (for Community &amp; International Health and Public Health Nutrition students)   GPH-GU 2621/22 Capstone in Global Public Health I &amp; II (for Global Health Leadership students)   GPH-GU 2686 Thesis I: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Development and GPH-GU 2687 Thesis II: Epidemiology Research &amp; Thesis Presentation (for Epidemiology students)                                                                Online Course Policy                               Students matriculated in the MPH program may complete up to 15 credits of core MPH courses toward their MPH degree via online coursework. As with MPH courses offered in-person, students in an online course must obtain a grade of C or higher to have these courses count toward their MPH degree.                                                              Pass/Fail Option                               Matriculated students in the NYU Master of Public Health program do not have the option to take credits toward their degree on a pass/fail basis. The only exception to this policy is those courses that are designated as pass/fail.                                                                Transfer Credit                                 Students enrolled in the MPH program will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 9 credits of approved graduate courses from a CEPH accredited school or program in public health.   Among these 9 transfer credits, only 6 transfer credits may count toward core courses in the MPH program (the core courses include Biostatistics for Public Health, Epidemiology, Health Policy &amp; Management, Environmental Health and Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health).   Individuals who complete MPH coursework at NYU as non-matriculated students will also be permitted to transfer up to 9 credits into the MPH program. Since these MPH courses were completed at NYU, all credits will be accepted irrespective of whether the courses were core or electives courses.   Transfer of credits will only be approved if (1) a grade of a C or better was obtained; (2) the courses were taken within the last 5 years; and (3) the courses were not counted towards a prior degree.   Students seeking approval for transfer of credits should submit a request in writing to the MPH program director and Academic Dean and should include: (1) an academic transcript showing course name, dates taken, letter grade obtained; and (2) course syllabus.   For those who have taken core courses or successfully completed all of the core courses that comprise the Advanced Certificate in Public Health through GIPH, up to 15 of these credits may be applied toward the MPH degree. As with courses taken outside of NYU, approval of transfer credits from the Advanced Certificate will be approved pending a grade of a C or better and completion of within the past 5 years.

After being cleared in NYU\u2019s registration system, Albert, students are permitted to register for only the courses in which they were approved by their assigned academic advisor.   Students who register for any courses which were not approved by their advisor (e.g., a different undergraduate major, different graduate NP program, or a course out of sequence for the DNP Program) may be involuntarily withdrawn from e non-approved courses. When students register for courses outside of their approved curriculum course progression, the courses may not count towards their degree in the College of Nursing.     The College of Nursing follows the university refund schedule for any dropped courses and the university registrar\u2019s calendar for the \u201cW\u201d notation appearing on student transcripts for withdrawn courses.   Back to top   Appointment of Capstone Project Committee This policy pertains to students who matriculated as of fall 2013.     Capstone Project teams consist of a group of students, a faculty mentor, and a clinical mentor. Two to 4 students will populate each of the teams. Teams will be assigned during the first semester of study in the DNP program. Also during the first semester, the DNP program director will appoint a faculty mentor. Clinical mentors are appointed by the healthcare agency in which students will be implementing their projects. In consultation with the clinical agency, the program director and the faculty mentor will develop specific topics for projects that the agency deems important. The faculty mentor, who is the team facilitator, must have an earned doctorate and may be a an adjunct or a full-time faculty member of the College of Nursing, holding the rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, clinical professor, or clinical associate professor, except in exceptional circumstances as determined by the DNP. program director. Clinical mentors must hold at least a master\u2019s degree. The director of the DNP. Program must approve all Capstone Project teams.   If, after your team has been officially appointed, circumstances require that you replace your faculty or clinical mentor, the faculty member being replaced must officially resign in writing. After the D.N.P. Program Office has received the appropriate memo of resignation, the front of this form should be signed by the new faculty or clinical mentor, as well as the D.N.P. program director, and submitted to the D.N.P. Program Office.   Back to top   Capstone Project Proposal Review A Capstone Project team must be officially appointed and on file with the NYUCN DNP Program Office prior to submission of the Capstone Project proposal. Students should obtain the necessary forms from the DNP Program Office and have them signed by the team\u2019s faculty and clinical mentors as well as a reader who is not part of the project team indicating their approval of the proposal for submission.   Back to top   Final Capstone Project Defense The final Capstone Project defense for the DNP degree will be conducted by the team\u2019s faculty and clinical mentors as well as a reader. Candidates are eligible for this examination only after the approved Capstone Project, abstract, and necessary forms (which may be obtained from the NYUCN DNP Program Office) have been transmitted for examination purposes and all other scholastic requirements have been met.   At least three weeks must intervene between the date of submission of the approved Capstone Project to the NYUCN D.N.P. Program Office and the final Capstone Project defense.   Back to top   Termination of Candidacy A member of the DNP faculty or of the Capstone Project team may at any time recommend to the DNP program director the termination of a student\u2019s candidacy for a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree, based on lack of sufficient academic progress or lapsed matriculation.   Back to top   Degree Requirements DNP students are required to complete the degree within 7 years from the date of matriculation (indicated on each student\u2019s statement of requirements) for the post-master\u2019s NP/CNM, with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0.     The credits recorded on the transcript for the post-master\u2019s NP/CNM will be from 73-86 depending on the population for which they are nationally certified.   Back to top   Attendance DNP Students are expected to actively participate in class and online discussions. The class meets on campus four days during the semester and students are expected to attend all sessions. Any absence must be approved by the instructor, and the student will be given an additional assignment to demonstrate mastery of the class content and related course learning outcomes.   Back to top   Drop/Add/Withdrawal Courses added or dropped without advisor approval may be considered as not meeting degree requirements. Students and advisors are urged to monitor this procedure carefully. Only an official advisor is authorized to sign a student\u2019s drop/add form.   Master\u2019s, advanced certificate, DNP, and PhD students are permitted to add to their program during the first two weeks of regular classes. A student wishing to add an additional course to the program during the third week of the term must have the approval of the instructor. A student may not add a course beyond the end of the third week of the term with the exception of courses that begin mid-semester. Students may register for mid-semester courses prior to the first meeting of the class.   No change in schedule is valid unless it is reported to the NYUCN Office of Advising &amp; Academic Services on the forms provided or by using the Albert registration system. Change of Program forms may be obtained from the Office of Advising &amp; Academic Services . Courses officially dropped during the first three weeks of the term will not appear on the transcript. Those dropped from the beginning of the fourth week through the ninth week of the term will be recorded with a grade of W. After the ninth week, no one may withdraw from a course. Students should consult the University Refund Schedule for financial implications of dropped courses.         Back to top   Grades To remain in good academic standing, a D.N.P. student must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0.   The scale of grades is based on a 4-point scale as follows*:   A   95 and above (4.0 points)   A-  90-94 (3.7 points)   B+  87-89 (3.3 points)   B   83-86 (3.0 points)   B-  80-82 (2.7 points)   C+  77-79 (2.3 points)   C   73-76 (2.0 points)   C-  70-72 (1.7 points)   D+  67-69 (1.3 points)   D   60-66 (1.0 points)   F   59 and below (0 points)   If a student repeats a course in which he or she had received a failing grade, only the second grade is counted in the grade point average (GPA).     Note: There are no A+, D-, or F+ grades.   Back to top   New York University DNP Student College of Nursing Requirements  I. Academic   A. GPA and Course Grade Requirements   To remain in good academic standing, a DNP student must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0. All student must earn a minimum of a B or better in every required DNP course. Failure to meet the GPA requirements places a student in academic jeopardy. There are three levels of   academic jeopardy:   Warning : occurs after the first semester a student meets the following criteria:   1) Has 9 credits or more of IP, IF, or N on their transcripts at any one time.   2) Falls below a cumulative GPA of 3.0. If the cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better is achieved by the following term, academic jeopardy is terminated.   3) Obtains less than a B in a required course. The student is required to re-take the course the next time it is offered. If at least a B is obtained in the required course, academic jeopardy is terminated.   Probation : After the second consecutive semester of meeting #1 or #2 above.   Dismissal : occurs for one of the following reasons:   1) If a repeated required course receives less than a B.   2) Two outcomes of fail on the proposal defense.   3) Two outcomes of fail on the capstone project defense.   4) Expiration of the seventh year for DNP matriculation period without an approved extension.   5) Expiration of an approved extension.   6) Three probationary terms or two consecutive probationary terms   7) Receiving a course grade of less than a B in two separate courses.     Reentry to the Program Following Dismissal: A student may reapply to the program from which they were dismissed one year after dismissal. The decision for readmission is based on review of a student\u2019s academic record and references.   W = Official withdrawal. If withdrawal occurs after the midpoint of the term and the student is failing at that time, the grade will be reported as F.   R = Registered paid auditor, not graded.   P = Pass, not counted in average.   N = No credit (see note below)   IP = Incomplete but passing\u2014term paper or other work or final examination lacking (grade given only with the permission of the instructor); may be made up within time limits (see below). If not made up, grade lapses to N.   IF = Incomplete but not passing; may be made up within time limits. If not made up, grade lapses to F. The F will be calculated into the GPA.   Under exceptional circumstances and at the discretion of the course instructor, an incomplete pass (IP) or an incomplete fail (IF) may be granted, based on the student\u2019s performance throughout the course of the semester. The length of the contract period is fixed by the instructor, but will be no longer than six months after the close of the semester. If outstanding work has not been completed by the end of the agreed time, an IP becomes an N (no credit) and an IF becomes an F. If the contract has been completed in a timely manner, it will be considered along with the remainder of the course performance, to determine the student\u2019s earned grade. No extension will be granted beyond the end of contract date.   Students with 9 credits or more of IP, IF, or N on their transcripts at any one time will be considered as not making satisfactory progress in their programs of study and will be subject to probation. Students who have three probationary terms or two consecutive probationary terms will be subject to dismissal. They will be subject to dismissal if they have 18 such credits on their transcripts at any one time. (Any N grade course that has been repeated with a passing grade will not be counted in these totals, nor will courses in which I grades are normally given.)   Note: The College of Nursing urges students taking courses in other schools and colleges to check with the respective schools for details of their grading policies because they may differ from those of the College of Nursing.   Back to top   Leave of Absence, Withdrawal and Maintenance of Matriculation DNP students who are taking a leave of absence are referred to their academic advisor to discuss their request for a Leave of Absence (LOA) or Official University Withdrawal. A leave of absence may be taken for a maximum of two semesters; that is, two continuous semesters equaling one academic year or two separate LOA semesters each taken in different academic years. Two LOAs are the maximum in the lifetime of a degree. Students must also complete an online withdrawal form, which is University based, and is found in their Student Center   Directions for submitting an LOA, Semester Withdrawal or Complete withdrawal are posted on the Registrar's website here: https://www.nyu.edu/registrar/withdrawal/   For students who are requesting an LOA, please review the Maintenance of Matriculation information.   Students should also consult the Bursar's Refund Schedule to determine the financial implications of taking an LOA or University Withdrawal: http://www.nyu.edu/bursar/refunds/schedule.html   The College of Nursing adheres to the policy that continuous maintenance of matriculation (MM) is required. After two leave of absence semesters (LOA), if a student does not enroll in classes, the student must transition to enrollment of Maintenance of Matriculation, which is good for one year only. The MM fee is the cost of tuition for one graduate nursing credit plus a nonrefundable registration and services fee. Registration procedures for MM are the same as any credit-bearing course. If these steps are not taken and the student does not register for MM, the student must reapply to the program and will be billed for past MM fees when they reappear to register or reenroll.   All course requirements must be completed within seven years from the date of matriculation. Continuous maintenance is required.
