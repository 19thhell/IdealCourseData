The program\u2019s focus on connecting technology with business strategy is a unique approach that allows you to learn to analyze the organization as one dynamic system\u2014giving you a major competitive advantage in an increasingly technological business world. Every course, no matter how specialized, has business strategy woven into its content.   With the option to take courses online, on-site, or through a combination of these formats, you can concentrate in one of four areas: database technologies; systems management; strategy and leadership; or enterprise risk management. And with courses offered during evenings and on weekends, the M.S. in Management and Systems can be pursued full- or part-time, allowing maximum flexibility for the schedule requirements of both the busy senior manager or executive, as well as the recent college graduate just beginning a career. The program can be completed in two years of full-time study, or in up to five years of part-time study.   Working with a faculty advisor, you map out your own program of study that includes seven core courses and four courses in one of four concentration options. You also choose an elective from any of the courses offered in the program, including a broad array of special topics courses. The capstone project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your newly acquired skills by developing a comprehensive research or applied project that makes an original contribution to the body of knowledge in the field.
