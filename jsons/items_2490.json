What, if anything, is  the meaning of life? Then, after a crash-course in ethical theory, we&rsquo;ll talk  about the morality of abortion and the morality of war. We&rsquo;ll then return to  a few more theoretical questions: why is death bad for the person who dies? Is it a  bad thing to have never lived at all? (If so, bad for whom?) Would it be better for  us if we were immortal? What is the appropriate attitude we should have towards  death? We&rsquo;ll end by considering another practical issue&mdash;suicide. A few  of the questions we&rsquo;ll address here: is it ever rational to commit suicide?  Is it ever moral to do so? When, if ever, is euthanasia morally permitted? No  background in philosophy required.      Group I: History of Philosophy      V83.0021-001   History of Modern Philosophy   T/TH 12:30-1:45   Elliot Paul         This course is an introduction to the some of the most influential European  philosophers of the 17 th and 18 th centuries: Descartes,  Locke, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, Reid, and Kant. We will consider and critically  examine the responses these thinkers gave to various questions in metaphysics and  epistemology, including the following: What is the relationship between reality and  our perception of reality? What is the nature of the mind and how is it related to  the body? What is the nature of physical reality? Which of our beliefs, if any, do  we have good reason to maintain in the face of radical skepticism?

We will read Kierkegaard&rsquo;s The Sickness  unto Death , excerpts from Husserl&rsquo;s Cartesian Meditations , and  substantial portions of Heidegger&rsquo;s Being and Time , Sartre&rsquo;s   Being and Nothingness , and Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s Phenomenology of  Perception . We are also likely to read some Beauvoir, and perhaps some Camus or  Levinas. Requirements: 2 papers and a final exam.

Religion and Morality in Nietzsche      The course will explore Nietzsche&rsquo;s claims about the way in which religion shapes our moral beliefs. We will ask which elements of our moral beliefs, on Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, we must give up in the absence of religion. Nietzsche tells us, for example, that Christianity is &lsquo;a system, a carefully considered, integrated view of things&rsquo; and that Christian morality therefore &lsquo;stands or falls with belief in God.&rsquo; We will interrogate what he means by this and similar claims through a reading of texts such as Beyond Good and Evil , On the Genealogy of Morality , The AntiChrist , and Twilight of the Idols .         V83.0101-002   Topics in History of Philosophy   MW 3:30-4:45   Thomas Nagel       Prerequisite:  Two courses in Philosophy, including either V83.0076 or V83.0078.    The topic of the course will be the moral philosophy of Hume and Kant.      Group II: Ethics, Value, and Society      V83.0040   Ethics   MW 11-12:15   Samuel Scheffler         An introduction to the philosophical study of morality. Topics to be considered  will include: traditional vs. consequentialist moral outlooks; contractualism; the  nature of moral motivation; the rationality of morality; the objectivity or  subjectivity of ethics; moral relativism; the explanatory role of morality; the  compatibility of morality with a purely naturalistic understanding of human beings.  Readings will be drawn from a variety of classical and contemporary sources.

Are we describing some aspect of an evaluative realm that exists independently of  what humans think and do? If so, how do we gain access to this realm? (Do we need  moral antennae or ethical telescopes?) And what is the relation between truths in  this realm and those in the ordinary world of mental and physical entities? If we  are not talking about independent ethical facts when we call something wrong or  bad, what are we doing? Are we saying anything meaningful at all, or are we merely  giving vent to our emotions?

When and why are citizens morally obligated to follow  these laws? This course will examine these questions through a  combination of historical and contemporary readings.        Sign up for one of the following sections:        V83.0045-002 Monday 3:30-4:45     V83.0045-003 Monday 4:55-6:10         V83.0102   Topics in Ethics and Political Philosophy   T/TH 4:55-6:10   Peter Unger         Prerequisite: Two courses in Philosophy, including  either V83.0040, V83.0041, V83.0045, or V83.0052.    Even as compared to what he  or she can do, almost all well-to-do people do little, or nothing, over the  course of their lifetime, to prevent the early deaths and great suffering of  people in the poorest parts of the world. Is it wrong for a well-to-do person  to behave like this - perhaps about as horribly wrong as committing negligent  homicide, as with fatal drunken driving? The course will center on this question,  though it will also involve us in many other moral questions. In about equal  measure, this will be a course in both normative ethics and in applied ethics.  (By contrast, little will be said about metaethics and, most likely, not much  about political philosophy, either.)      Group III: Metaphysics, Epistemology, Mind, Language, and Logic    V83.0070-001   Logic   MW 12:30-1:45   Seunghyun Song         Introduces the techniques,  results, and philosophical import of 20th century formal logic. Principal  concepts include those of interpretation, validity, implication, derivation,  soundness and completeness. This course satisfies the logic requirement for NYU  Philosophy majors.      V83.0070-002   Logic   T/TH 2-3:15   David Barnett         This  course introduces the techniques, results, and philosophical import of 20th  century formal logic. Principal concepts include those of sentence, set,  interpretation, validity, consistency, consequence, tautology, derivation, and  completeness. More advanced topics will be covered if time permits. This course  satisfies the logic requirement for NYU Philosophy majors.      V83.0070-002   V83.0074    Modal Logic   TR 11-12:15   Ted Sider      In introductory logic you learn the basics of  standard propositional and predicate logic. In this course we&rsquo;ll begin by  taking a deeper look at standard logic. We&rsquo;ll then discuss modal  logic&mdash;the logic of possibility and necessity&mdash;and counterfactual  conditionals. Our main approach will be that of possible-worlds semantics.        V83.0074-002 Tuesday 12:30-1:45     V83.0074-003 Tuesday 2:00-3:15         V83.0076   Belief, Truth and Knowledge   MW 12:30-1:45   Imogen Dickie         The first part of the course  will be a general introduction to the theory of knowledge. We will look at the  answers to the question \u00d4What is knowledge?&rsquo; that philosophers have developed  in the attempt to provide a satisfactory response to sceptics, who think that  we don&rsquo;t know anything. The second part of the course will use tools acquired  in the first part to discuss the following topics: knowledge based on  perception; knowledge based on memory; our knowledge of our own minds; the  problem of what we can know about what happens in the minds of other people.      V83.0078   Metaphysics   T/TH 9:30-10:45   Jon Simon         What is there, really? In this course we will  investigate the fundamental nature of reality. Why is there Something rather  than Nothing? What is Time? What is Space? What is Matter? What is  Consciousness? What is Perception? What is Value? What is a Person? What is  Freedom? What is a Law of Nature? What is it for something to be Fundamental?  Through addressing these questions we will also address the methodological  question: to what extent should physics (and the hard sciences generally)  inform metaphysics, and to what extent can metaphysics inform physics.      V83.0085   Philosophy of Language   T/TH 3:30-4:45   Crispin Wright         This course will concentrate on a small number of  central questions in recent and contemporary philosophy of  language. Familiarity with elementary formal logic will be helpful.  Topics to be covered include skepticism about meaning, with special reference  to writings of Quine, Kripke and Putnam; the nature of knowledge of a language,  with special reference to the work of Davidson and Dummett; and the competing  paradigms of singular reference deriving from Frege and from Kripke. Grades  will be awarded on the basis of two mid-term papers, and a take-home final  exam.
