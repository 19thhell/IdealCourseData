The human being is the strangest of all animals, because of the phenomenon called thought. Reaching beyond our personal capsule of life might make us completely free. Such is the manic truth, the reflection of himself, that D.H. Lawrence thrusts forward in the collections of essays entitled &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Phoenix II.&quot; The processes of his mind invite inquiry. To Lawrence, conversation with a person is seldom the best way to know that person. Rather, we come to know a person more fully by a process of reading him-absorbing the subtleties of his life, and extrapolating these into a portrait of his mind. In his writing, Lawrence grants the opportunity for us to read him, in the very literal way, so that we might come to know his own mind more fully.           In &quot;On Coming Home,&quot; we see a rare instance of Lawrence practicing something near autobiography, recounting a personal experience. On the deck of a ship, near landing on the shore of England, he feels the famous words of Sir Walter Scott &quot;explode into his chest&quot; (II 250): &quot;Breathes there a man with soul so dead/ Who never to himself hath said/ This is my own, my native land&quot; (250). Without, it seems, a moment of reflection, and cutting off Scott's words in his own mind, Lawrence exclaims: &quot;With a vengeance!&quot; We begin, quite confused, anticipating the impetus for such a startling reaction. Lawrence does not disappoint. At the moment the British arrive on deck to land the ship, his senses register a subtle but important atmospheric shift: &quot;All is strangely still. . . England is on board . . . curiously quiet and withheld-everything has fallen silent&quot; (251). As we move forward in &quot;On Coming Home,&quot; that silence swells into a scathing indictment of what Lawrence sees as the defining English way: the &quot;shut-in-edness&quot; of an &quot;unnatural conceit&quot; (253).           Lawrence's movement of ideas-from dulled English voices to bursting English egos-reveals within him a power of perception that pervades all of his essays, a power that manifests itself in an endless parade of what I will call his &quot;assertions.&quot; In the traditional way of discerning things, people reach conclusions based on observations bolstered by damning evidence. Lawrence often leaves the terrain of this last stipulation-the damning evidence-totally untraveled. In &quot;Germans and English,&quot; we see him in Florence, struck by the strange presence of the Wandervogels, the irreverent young German tourists. He becomes positively engaged at the mere sight of these strangers; they spawn within him an intricate dialogue that encompasses the spheres of the German, the Italian, and the English alike. Engagements such as this one signal a trend in Lawrence's writing: they make the essays, in large part, snapshots of D. H. Lawrence watching others-watching mainly their idiosyncrasies, their vices-and bringing quick, sweeping indictments of human character.           What runs through Lawrence's body of work like a vein of thought is his sense that England stands at the edge of demise. Scott's rhetorical question burns through him: &quot;Breathes there a man with soul so dead?&quot; Lawrence's perception drives him to answer in the affirmative, on behalf of every man in England-the land of the &quot;darkness that doesn't speak&quot; (II 250). He feels the &quot;strange germ&quot; (253) of the English way closing in around him. Yet he is undeniably an Englishman. Where does that place him among the sugar-sprinklers of complacency, those men he derides so vehemently? A better question might be to ask where it places us. This presents a complicated dilemma, since Lawrence's conclusions seem so sudden and arbitrary. In the case of &quot;On Coming Home,&quot; his imagery brings us the scene. We are to imagine an &quot;absentness,&quot; a &quot;soft, vague . . . curious stillness&quot; that makes everything seem &quot;dead, muffled&quot; (252). Lawrence compares the feeling to that of being placed in the smallest of many boxes that fit inside each other-a &quot;shut-in-edness&quot; (253). Those of us who do not share Lawrence's acute power of perception gain its result when the language drives our minds to a claustrophobic state. What he hopes we see, despite the English ego that he observes, is a fear in his kinsmen, a sad way of self-deprecation. They are self-contained and self-protecting, and the land to which Scott refers becomes for the Englishmen a &quot;crystal bubble&quot; of isolation (252). Lawrence concludes &quot;On Coming Home&quot; condemning the half-hidden English self-deprecation, saying, &quot;Men have no business on their knees&quot; (255). He yearns for the &quot;old brave, reckless, manly England&quot; (256). In &quot;Germans and English,&quot; he assigns to the Wandervogels the goal of &quot;rushing away from all that is&quot; (246). In &quot;Master in His Own House,&quot; he creates &quot;the usual&quot; modern couple, Jim and Julia (II 547), reflecting that &quot;every little boy sees himself a future master in his own house&quot; (546). These thoughts travel beneath the skin-they presume to probe deep into people's emotional innards; Lawrence clearly does not balk at broad assertion, does not waver for fear of offending his reader. What Lawrence thinks, Lawrence writes-unequivocally and confidently.           In &quot;Cocksure Women and Hensure Men,&quot; Lawrence brings us closer to the deep-seated differences that isolate man from man, and, in this case, man from woman. He finds himself caught between two sides in life's oldest battle-the battle of the sexes. The observed &quot;cocksureness&quot; of the modern woman fascinates him. He sees the contemporary woman constantly yearning for the perceived privileges and benefits of maleness, and, in turn, wrongly forsaking the crucial elements of her own femininity-a tragedy of utmost import. In so doing, often she finds she has &quot;laid a vote&quot; (II 555) instead of an egg. Lawrence's tone, particularly in this essay, betrays something within himself that would today be called chauvinism: he suggests that the contemporary woman cling to her &quot;hensureness&quot;-her egg-laying. This apparent audacity grants us a generationally contingent understanding of Lawrence: where today's feminist might consider his statements discriminatory, his contemporaries might have readily endorsed this sentiment as simply supporting the traditional role of the woman. But women are not alone in abandoning traditional roles. In &quot;Master of His Own House,&quot; Lawrence laments the male's learned indifference to traditionally male pursuits which, left abandoned, have opened up to women. Lawrence finds both men and women yearning for the other's gender-yearning, as the Englishmen had in &quot;On Coming Home,&quot; to be someone else; and hiding, as the Englishmen had, behind a faade of egoism.           The conception of humanity Lawrence engenders is not a happy one. He sees a country slipping away into muffled silence, sees men shrinking strangely from their former power. Interestingly, as a man and an Englishman, Lawrence is himself at the nucleus of both declining systems. What can he bring to the battle for survival, for the preservation of what he calls in &quot;On Coming Home&quot; the &quot;imagination of men&quot; (II 254)?           The answer to this question begins to creep into focus upon reading &quot;Thinking About Oneself.&quot; Lawrence identifies what he thinks is a dangerous mass ideal:           You would think, to hear people talk, that the greatest bugbear you can possibly have is yourself. If you can't get away from yourself, if you can't forget yourself, you're doomed. The mill-stone is round your neck, so you might as well jump in and drown yourself. (I 735)           Nonsense, responds Lawrence. He asks, with great incredulity, why people might be afraid of themselves. He has forgotten, perhaps, that he has already told us the answer. People fear because they loathe their present state of being. We witnessed this loathing in the Englishmen and in the men and women yearning to switch places with each other. This feeling, or lack of feeling, is the unspeaking darkness that haunted Lawrence in &quot;On Coming Home.&quot; In &quot;The Novel and the Feelings,&quot; he finally begins to coax us from the darkness into the light. We are educated, he concedes, but &quot;it's all France without Paris, Hamlet without the Prince, and bricks without straw. For we know nothing, or next to nothing, about ourselves&quot; (I 755). He compares our minds to reluctantly domesticated animals. &quot;Educated!&quot; he scoffs, &quot;We are not even born, as far as our feelings are concerned&quot; (757). We have turned our backs, he says, against the deepest part of ourselves, &quot;fenced it in with an enormous entanglement of barbed wire, and declared it did not exist&quot; (757). In so doing, says Lawrence, man becomes the taming force over his own mind.           All of this brings us back to &quot;Germans and English,&quot; where Lawrence identified a &quot;curious radical isolation&quot; (II 247). At the conclusion of the essay, he offers a sort of cathartic strain:           So it is. We all have our own Volkerschicksale. At the same time, we are all men, and we can all have some glimpse of realization of one another, if we just use imagination and intuition and all our instincts, instead of just one or two. And the fate of all nations in Europe hangs together. We have our separate Volkerschicksale. But there is over and above a human destiny, and a European destiny. (249)           While it makes for a handsome ending, this conclusion seems a bit too easy in its grandness, in its purporting to impart some secret panacea for man. We have seen people being so &quot;grand&quot; in Lawrence's other essays. But so far he has not been among them. To the contrary, he has stood over them, chiding them for their ridiculousness. This last proclamation, in all its presumptuousness, encloses Lawrence within his own &quot;crystal bubble,&quot; and we can almost spy him sprinkling his own sugar in his own pretty way, cooing prettily to himself, &quot;So it is, so it is.&quot; He has stepped beyond the broad but carefully measured assertions we have encountered thus far, releasing to the light the inextricable Englishman who is bound tightly to his core-the &quot;old brave, reckless, manly&quot; Englishman just itching to tell the world what he has ascertained (256).           The imagination and intuition and instinct to which Lawrence would have us aspire seem familiar as well. We saw imagination in his making farm animals out of men and women; intuition in his deep digging into the human soul; instinct in his knowing people's hidden motives and pains. His remedy for us, then, is bound up with his own powers of thought and writing. His uncanny power of perception in writing implicitly invites us to turn such a perceptive eye inward , toward our very souls, so that we might un-domesticate our emotions and begin &quot;listening-in to the voices of the honorable beasts that call in the dark paths of the veins of our body, from the God in the heart&quot; (I 759). Our power to overcome, then, lies not in fear, self-denial, or repression. It lies in the inward-looking intuition that separates us from the animals-the same uniquely human energy that fuels the engine driving Lawrence's own thought.
