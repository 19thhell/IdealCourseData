Students have the option to receive introductory music business training or learn about the history and culture of creative entrepreneurs in recorded music. Students are also introduced to the tools and techniques of recording and begin to use the recording studio as their creative laboratory. In the second year, students deepen their understanding of the art and business of creating and selling recorded music. Students have the opportunity to study the \u201cartist,\u201d how musical talent is identified and cultivated, how material is selected and arranged, how a complete album is constructed in the studio and how the audience and artist have historically influenced each other. Upon completion of a second year review, students work closely with their faculty advisor to develop a personalized course of study focusing on their area of interest. During the third and fourth years, students may pursue advanced level study in business, production, history &amp; criticism, or musicianship via courses offered through the department, as well as through the Stern School of Business, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Also, during their third year, students have the opportunity to study abroad in one of Tisch's study abroad programs, or participate in the department\u2019s required internship program. The \ufb01nal year culminates with the Capstone Project in which students develop a full creative plan to launch themselves as entrepreneurs. Projects have included launching a record label, creating a production company, developing a new media company, and starting an innovative music venue. As is the case with all Tisch programs, professional training is combined with a solid liberal arts education. In addition to the 58 points taken within the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, students are expected to earn a total of 44 general education points in courses offered by Tisch and the College of Arts and Science. Students also complement their study with 26 points in elective courses taken in the areas of their interest.    Internship Opportunites    Students have the opportunity to complete an industry internship at an established, institutional record company such as Universal or Mercury Records; an independent production company such as Epitaph Records; a trade publication such as Billboard or Impact ; a trade broadcast company such as VH1 or MTV; or a music recording association such as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), or the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
