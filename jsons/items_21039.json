The course focuses on Medicare's prospective payment systems for hospital and other provider type reimbursement. It also covers New York State Medicaid reimbursement issues and provides a general understanding of the healthcare charge structure. The course will also focus on the fundamentals of establishing a compliance program to identify and prevent fraud and abuse issues.      Payment methods serve as a regulatory and market mechanism guiding the direction and activities of healthcare providers. It is essential that decision makers understand and assess the impact of reimbursement methodologies and the interaction between healthcare regulation, reimbursement methodologies and financial decision making.      This course will familiarize students with payment methodologies as directed by current Federal and New York State health care regulations and market forces. The course focuses on reimbursement for institutional and professional services.      The course includes analysis of actual reimbursement techniques and will familiarize students with the source documents and the process necessary for the analysis of Federal and New York State regulations.

NYU schools, departments, and programs who accept ePayments are known as NYU merchants .       The Payment Gateway is NYU's Electronic Payment processing system. The Payment Gateway is a transaction-based system that accepts ePayment transactions for both one-time and recurring payments. The service may be implemented to receive payment for items such as online gift donations, conference registration, specific fees related to a university event, or other products and services.       ePayments is the exclusive and official service for accepting electronic payments at NYU.
