Ellen et al.          05/28/2014               The State of New York City\u2019s Housing and Neighborhoods in 2013 report , published annually by the NYU Furman Center, provides a compendium of data and analysis about New York City\u2019s housing, land use, demographics, and quality of life indicators for each borough and the city\u2019s 59 community districts.      The report combines timely and expert analysis of NYU Furman Center researchers with data transparency. It is presented in three parts:      Part 1: Focus on Economic Inequality      Each year, the State of New York City\u2019s Housing and Neighborhoods describes, contextualizes, and provides analysis on a pressing and policy-relevant issue affecting New York City. In 2013, the report focuses on economic inequality in New York City, analyzing changes over time in the distribution of the city\u2019s income, economic segregation of city residents, and the neighborhood environments experienced by people of different incomes.      Part 2: City-Wide Analysis      The City-Wide Analysis provides a broad, longitudinal analysis of the New York City's housing and neighborhoods. The chapter is divided into five parts: land use and the built environment; homeowners and their homes; renters and their homes; income and workers; and neighborhood services and conditions.      Part 3: City, Borough, and Community District Data      The data section provides current and historical statistics for over 50 housing, neighborhood, and socioeconomic indicators at the city, borough, and community district levels. It also includes indicator definitions and rankings; methods; and an index of New York City\u2019s Community Districts and Sub-Borough Areas.
