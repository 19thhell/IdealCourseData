Next offering is August 2016.    This course analyzes the historical and cultural contingency of race-based affirmative action policies in Brazil and to analyze the broader contemporary controversies and social implications of the globalization of higher education.    Brazil has the largest (and by most measures, best) higher education system in Latin America, and enrollments have undergone explosive growth over the last 20 years. We begin with an historical overview then move to an analysis of contemporary issues. Students gain an understanding of the variety of higher education institutions in Brazil (federal and state public institutions, private non-profit and private for-profit universities, etc.) and become familiar with issues of internationalization in higher education, faculty and student mobility, research in a global context, variation among public versus private universities and their economic structures, the role of foreign university partnerships, and other higher education issues.    As a major focus, we use race &ndash; an extremely context-dependent ideology &ndash; as a main entry point into an examination of Brazilian higher education. Brazil began to implement affirmative action policies in 2003, stoking enormous cultural, legal, and education debates. At the same time, there were also huge changes in funding and government oversight at universities. The terms of the debates around access to higher education are different in Brazil and the United States, and the stakes and stakeholders are different, but the intensity of the issue is very high.

Next offering is August 2016.    This course analyzes the historical and cultural contingency of race-based affirmative action policies in Brazil and to analyze the broader contemporary controversies and social implications of the globalization of higher education.    Brazil has the largest (and by most measures, best) higher education system in Latin America, and enrollments have undergone explosive growth over the last 20 years. We begin with an historical overview then move to an analysis of contemporary issues. Students gain an understanding of the variety of higher education institutions in Brazil (federal and state public institutions, private non-profit and private for-profit universities, etc.) and become familiar with issues of internationalization in higher education, faculty and student mobility, research in a global context, variation among public versus private universities and their economic structures, the role of foreign university partnerships, and other higher education issues.    As a major focus, we use race &ndash; an extremely context-dependent ideology &ndash; as a main entry point into an examination of Brazilian higher education. Brazil began to implement affirmative action policies in 2003, stoking enormous cultural, legal, and education debates. At the same time, there were also huge changes in funding and government oversight at universities. The terms of the debates around access to higher education are different in Brazil and the United States, and the stakes and stakeholders are different, but the intensity of the issue is very high.

Through visits to universities and public and private colleges, we will engage in discussions with presidents, provosts, directors, faculty members, deans and students themselves. Special lectures with sociologists and national officials will help us understand the goals and future aspirations of Brazilian higher education and how it meets (or does not) the social, political, and cultural needs of its society.    The program specifically examines race classification systems from an historical point of view in both the US and Brazil, then moves to an analysis of contemporary issues in race and higher education, especially regarding debates around affirmative action and the value of diversity in education. Activities includes lectures from scholars and visits to Brazilian colleges and universities to meet with faculty, administrators, and students. Additional sessions will be held with leaders of NGOs and research foundations. Topics will include curricular opportunities; college admissions requirements; distribution of students by class and race; government policy and planning. Students enroll for 3 required credits and may also enroll in an optional independent study for an additional 3 credits. Click here for more information.    Full-Time Student Perspective: Cynthia M. Alcantar, Ph.D. '15    One of the benefits of attending school at NYU is the opportunity to study abroad as a graduate student. As an undergraduate student I did not have the opportunity to study abroad for various reasons. Looking back on my undergraduate experience, I deeply regret not studying abroad. So when I started my Ph.D. at NYU I decided that it was an opportunity I couldn&rsquo;t pass up.    The study abroad program on Race and Higher Education in Brazil was an excellent fit with my program of study. This study abroad course gave me a global perspective on college access and admission policy issues. Visiting various colleges and non-profit organizations allowed me to critically think about the contrast and similarities in race relations and college access between Brazil and the U.S.    Aside from spurring an intellectual curiosity about college access in other Latin American countries, it also deepened my desire to travel abroad. Our travels through the historic areas of Salvador, Liberdade of Sao Paulo, and Copacabana and Ipanema beaches and the favelas of Rio de Janeiro really sparked my desire to visit other Latin American gems.

Next offering is August 2016.    This course analyzes the historical and cultural contingency of race-based affirmative action policies in Brazil and to analyze the broader contemporary controversies and social implications of the globalization of higher education.    Brazil has the largest (and by most measures, best) higher education system in Latin America, and enrollments have undergone explosive growth over the last 20 years. We begin with an historical overview then move to an analysis of contemporary issues. Students gain an understanding of the variety of higher education institutions in Brazil (federal and state public institutions, private non-profit and private for-profit universities, etc.) and become familiar with issues of internationalization in higher education, faculty and student mobility, research in a global context, variation among public versus private universities and their economic structures, the role of foreign university partnerships, and other higher education issues.    As a major focus, we use race &ndash; an extremely context-dependent ideology &ndash; as a main entry point into an examination of Brazilian higher education. Brazil began to implement affirmative action policies in 2003, stoking enormous cultural, legal, and education debates.

Through visits to universities and public and private colleges, we will engage in discussions with presidents, provosts, directors, faculty members, deans and students themselves. Special lectures with sociologists and national officials will help us understand the goals and future aspirations of Brazilian higher education and how it meets (or does not) the social, political, and cultural needs of its society.    The program specifically examines race classification systems from an historical point of view in both the US and Brazil, then moves to an analysis of contemporary issues in race and higher education, especially regarding debates around affirmative action and the value of diversity in education. Activities includes lectures from scholars and visits to Brazilian colleges and universities to meet with faculty, administrators, and students. Additional sessions will be held with leaders of NGOs and research foundations. Topics will include curricular opportunities; college admissions requirements; distribution of students by class and race; government policy and planning. Students enroll for 3 required credits and may also enroll in an optional independent study for an additional 3 credits. Click here for more information.    Full-Time Student Perspective: Cynthia M. Alcantar, Ph.D. '15    One of the benefits of attending school at NYU is the opportunity to study abroad as a graduate student. As an undergraduate student I did not have the opportunity to study abroad for various reasons. Looking back on my undergraduate experience, I deeply regret not studying abroad. So when I started my Ph.D. at NYU I decided that it was an opportunity I couldn&rsquo;t pass up.    The study abroad program on Race and Higher Education in Brazil was an excellent fit with my program of study. This study abroad course gave me a global perspective on college access and admission policy issues. Visiting various colleges and non-profit organizations allowed me to critically think about the contrast and similarities in race relations and college access between Brazil and the U.S.    Aside from spurring an intellectual curiosity about college access in other Latin American countries, it also deepened my desire to travel abroad. Our travels through the historic areas of Salvador, Liberdade of Sao Paulo, and Copacabana and Ipanema beaches and the favelas of Rio de Janeiro really sparked my desire to visit other Latin American gems.
