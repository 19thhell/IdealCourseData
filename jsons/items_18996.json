Gilbert All Rights Reserved     Course Description  The impact of music technology and implications for music education are examined. Students are introduced to MIDI ( M usic I nstrument D igital I nterface) and the use of MIDI in producing music scores for classroom and ensembles as well as the use of MIDI in live performance in student ensembles. Students use the World Wide Web as a resource for teaching and learning. Other implications of technology for music education are also briefly introduced and discussed.       TOPICS FOR CONTEMPORARY TRENDS IN MUSIC EDUCATION     SOME INTRODUCTORY REMARKS   The Studio  This course utilizes Studio E as a resource for demonstrations and for students to develop hands-on skills through application of course lectures and demonstrations. This is not a \"lab course\" where there are one or two students at a number of computers. This is a Studio Course where students are introduced to the studio, the technology available in the studio, and specific applications. This is not a production course which emphasizes the development of a product or products at the end of the course. The focus of the course is on the process of working with applications. The \"products\" you develop will demonstrate your grasp of the processes involved. The course is also focused on how technology can extend the potential of our efforts as professionals in music and especially as music educators.    TECHNOLOGY IN THE SERVICE OF MUSIC EDUCATION: AN INTRODUCTION   The Marriage of Music and Technology  The relationship of music to technology is not new. If we regard technology as the extension of human ability through technical and process-oriented applications we realize that the moment human beings began to move to technology for music making the moment they used other means beside the human voice to make music. Much of the history of music and musical styles can be looked at as the development of technology to serve music. Machines for making music such as keyboards, violins, wind and brass instruments, percussion instruments, etc. have been steadily modified throughout history in order to increase the range of human capacity for making music.   Recent developments in digital technology have impacted on all phases of music making, from digitized sound sources, sampling of acoustic sounds, digital recording, to creation of sound scores and music notation. This technological leap has transformed not only how people make music, but also how music is delivered to a public and how people listen to music.   In addition to impacting directly on music making, the new technologies have direct bearing on how we teach music. Developments of the internet and World Wide Web and other means of communicating information such as CDRom, now provide a tremendous resource for miusic educators at all levels.

The website should be continually updated with information and insights related to the course.   In addition, students will select one activity from the options below:   1. Using Nightingale, compose or arrange a piece for chorus and at least three instruments or for an instrumental ensemble such as you might direct in a school setting. Provide a master score and extract the parts. Preface your work with a discussion of the process you used and the educational context of your work.    OR      2. Using the sequencer Freestyle, write or arrange a piece of music which explores the sound possibilities of synthesizers.    OR      3. Utilize digital audio in the creation of a multimedia piece using the synthesizer along with recorded environmental or acoustic sounds.    OR     4. Develop a research paper which illustrates the use of MIDI for music education in which you provide hypertext examples of music synthesis and music notation. This will be written in html (hypertext) and posted on the WWW at your NYU website.   Your plan for the project as well as documentation for the project will be posted on the WWW at your NYU website. All projects should include discussion of the relevance of the project to concepts in music education.     EVALUATION   You will be evaluated on attendance, class participation in questions and discussions, initiative, presentation (including e-mail questions and replies, and especially your website), requested written assignments, examination, and term project. All assignments should be in your folder on the computer. Eventually they will be forwarded to the instructor as attachments to e-mail, with some exceptions. Be sure to make a backup of your work on a floppy disk or a ZIP disk. Excuses that the work was completed but accidentally erased from the hard drive are not acceptable. Making backups is part of your weekly routine in the Studio.   This is a graduate course and each student is expected to go beyond the minimum requirements of the course and the specific assignments. Assignments serve as starting points. Students are expected to challenge themselves at their level. The background of each student with regard to music technology is taken into account in the evaluative process.  In general, the evaluation will use the following guidelines for determining the final grade:      50% Assignments in folder and on website  30% Final Project  10% Internet Exams  10% all other (attendance, email, participation)     The above serve only as guidelines. Extraordinary work and evidence of initiative and imagination will be rewarded.
