New York University's \"school of music\" has historically been housed in the Steinhardt School. Music programs were created in The Steinhardt School in 1925, approximately 40 years before the creation of NYU's (Tisch) School of the Arts. Consequently, all degrees in music performance at NYU -- baccalaureate through doctoral -- are housed in The Steinhardt School. Steinhardt's music performance programs in voice (classical and music theatre), piano, strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and jazz instruments are internationally recognized. Steinhardt provides intense music performance training along with top-tier music academic courses within the context of a world-renowned university.    Additional undergraduate and/or graduate music degrees are offered in Steinhardt in Music Composition, Music Business, Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Therapy. With 1,600 music majors and some 400 music faculty, the aggregate of Steinhardt's music programs represent one of the largest \"music schools\" in the United States.    Q. What is the difference between (1) Steinhardt's Music Business and Music Technology programs and (2) Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music?    First, for information regarding Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music, please visit their website . Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded music grants a BFA degree. By way of difference, students majoring in Steinhardt's Music Business Program or Steinhardt's Music Technology Program receive the B.M., the bachelor of music degree. Furthermore, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology students are required to complete an audition and to read music prior to admission to Steinhardt.    In accordance with national standards for undergraduate degrees in music, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are required to complete 16 \"core\" courses, four each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation. That \"core\" curriculum of sixteen courses is not offered in Tisch.    In addition to the \"core\" curriculum, Steinhardt Music Business majors complete a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses in Music Business including internships, along with courses in The Stern School of Business and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences. Steinhardt Music Technology majors complete the sixteen \"core\" courses along with a very substantial number of courses in music technology in our multiple music recording studios and labs, internships, and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences.    Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are often serious performers, composers and producers, who develop those talents through private music instruction with our acclaimed faculty.    While there are longstanding master's programs in Music Business and Music Technology in The Steinhardt School, at present, only the BFA is offered in Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.    Q. What is the difference between a music performance major and a music education major?    Music performance majors in Steinhardt receive \"music conservatory\" training as performers in preparation for careers in music performance. They are not required to take courses in music education, do not participate in student teaching, and are not certified to teach K-12.    Music Education majors in Steinhardt are expected to be outstanding musicians. Undergraduate music education majors have a \"primary instrument\" (instrument or voice), take private lessons throughout their four years, participate in ensembles, and present senior recitals on their primary instrument, very much like music performance majors. However, in addition to intense study in music, music education majors take a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses related to music education, including mentored student teaching assignments. Upon completion of the B.M. degree, Steinhardt music education majors are able to teach K-12 in most states in the U.S. Each state has its own teacher licensing exams and guidelines, which may require completion of a masters&rsquo; degree within five years of completion of the bachelors degree.       Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September. Please click on &ldquo;Auditions&rdquo; in this web site and then click on &ldquo;Current Students&rdquo; and follow instructions.

The program is also approved by the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) and upon graduation qualifies a student to apply for national certification in music therapy (MT-BC).    There is a maximum of 60 credits required for MA students who have no previous music therapy certification. For those who are already certified and entering the masters program, there is a requirement of 48 credits for New York State licensure.    The number of credits is contingent upon evaluation and advisement; each student is assigned an advisor at the beginning of the first semester of study. In order to ensure that pre-requisites and competencies have been met, evaluations occur at the audition/interview before enrollment, as well as after the first year of study. In this way, the course of study can be tailored to the student's needs, as well as to ensure that objectives and competencies will be met.    Over 90% of graduates that have taken the MT-BC exam between 2003-2013 have successfully passed the exam and obtained board certification.

New York University's \"school of music\" has historically been housed in the Steinhardt School. Music programs were created in The Steinhardt School in 1925, approximately 40 years before the creation of NYU's (Tisch) School of the Arts. Consequently, all degrees in music performance at NYU -- baccalaureate through doctoral -- are housed in The Steinhardt School. Steinhardt's music performance programs in voice (classical and music theatre), piano, strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and jazz instruments are internationally recognized. Steinhardt provides intense music performance training along with top-tier music academic courses within the context of a world-renowned university.    Additional undergraduate and/or graduate music degrees are offered in Steinhardt in Music Composition, Music Business, Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Therapy. With 1,600 music majors and some 400 music faculty, the aggregate of Steinhardt's music programs represent one of the largest \"music schools\" in the United States.    Q. What is the difference between (1) Steinhardt's Music Business and Music Technology programs and (2) Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music?    First, for information regarding Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music, please visit their website . Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded music grants a BFA degree. By way of difference, students majoring in Steinhardt's Music Business Program or Steinhardt's Music Technology Program receive the B.M., the bachelor of music degree. Furthermore, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology students are required to complete an audition and to read music prior to admission to Steinhardt.    In accordance with national standards for undergraduate degrees in music, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are required to complete 16 \"core\" courses, four each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation. That \"core\" curriculum of sixteen courses is not offered in Tisch.    In addition to the \"core\" curriculum, Steinhardt Music Business majors complete a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses in Music Business including internships, along with courses in The Stern School of Business and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences. Steinhardt Music Technology majors complete the sixteen \"core\" courses along with a very substantial number of courses in music technology in our multiple music recording studios and labs, internships, and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences.    Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are often serious performers, composers and producers, who develop those talents through private music instruction with our acclaimed faculty.    While there are longstanding master's programs in Music Business and Music Technology in The Steinhardt School, at present, only the BFA is offered in Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.    Q. What is the difference between a music performance major and a music education major?    Music performance majors in Steinhardt receive \"music conservatory\" training as performers in preparation for careers in music performance. They are not required to take courses in music education, do not participate in student teaching, and are not certified to teach K-12.    Music Education majors in Steinhardt are expected to be outstanding musicians. Undergraduate music education majors have a \"primary instrument\" (instrument or voice), take private lessons throughout their four years, participate in ensembles, and present senior recitals on their primary instrument, very much like music performance majors. However, in addition to intense study in music, music education majors take a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses related to music education, including mentored student teaching assignments. Upon completion of the B.M. degree, Steinhardt music education majors are able to teach K-12 in most states in the U.S. Each state has its own teacher licensing exams and guidelines, which may require completion of a masters&rsquo; degree within five years of completion of the bachelors degree.       Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September. Please click on &ldquo;Auditions&rdquo; in this web site and then click on &ldquo;Current Students&rdquo; and follow instructions.

Our pianists work closely with renowned Artist Faculty in private lessons, participate in our nationally regarded Artist Master Class Series , and perform as solo and collaborative artists at venues throughout New York City.    Course Work    Musical training for B.M. students includes private lessons with Artist Faculty , chamber music coaching with members of top New York ensembles, and three semesters of Piano Literature, in addition to a conservatory-style sequence of courses in music theory, aural comprehension, keyboard harmony and improvisation, and music history. NYU&rsquo;s rich liberal arts offerings promise a lively artistic and intellectual experience for the developing musician.    Required course work includes private lessons and chamber music coachings, as well as courses in piano literature, keyboard skills, music theory, aural comprehension, and music history. Each Spring, students are evaluated in juried performances, and all pianists present full recitals their junior and senior years. The degree requires a 130 credits (40 in the liberal arts and 90 in music), of which more than twenty are electives chosen from a wide array of offerings, ranging from classes in Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Business to Alexander Technique and secondary lessons in jazz, composition, and conducting.    A new dual degree (B.M. Music/M.A. Music Education) is designed for undergraduate performance and composition majors interested in adding a music education component to the four-year degree. Students apply at the end of their sophomore year. Once accepted into the dual degree by the music education faculty, students complete their degree with the added concentration in music education beginning in their junior year. Upon graduation, students may continue to a one-year master's degree in music education, where they complete their supervised student teaching internship to earn initial and professional teaching certification. Please see your current program director before contacting the Music Education program.    Preparation    In today&rsquo;s evolving world of the performing arts, pianists must enter their careers with more skills than ever before. The successful pianists of tomorrow must be distinctive creative artists and musical thinkers well-versed in the ways of the music business. The chance to develop as an artist in the cultural capital of the worls, in the stimulating environment of a major research university, in the historic setting of Greenwich Village - this is the unique experience that Piano Studies at NYU Steinhardt offers.    Through intense private study with world-class artists, chamber music coaching with top performers in the field, master classes with guest artists, and frequent performance opportunities, talented students develop surely into professional musicians. Nurtured by their teachers and encouraged by their peers, the undergraduate pianists of NYU Steinhardt emerge uniquely prepared to face the challenges of a career in music.    Performance    All piano majors have access to performances opportunities on campus and off, at venues around New York City. Additionally, each Spring features NYU Steinhardt pianists in our Artist Master Class Series ; weekly classes offer exciting chances for collaboration among student pianists and internationally regarded artists and pedagogues such as Malcolm Bilson, Andre Laplante, Julian Martin, Garrick Ohlsson, Ursula Oppens, and Nelita True.

The program is also approved by the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) and upon graduation qualifies a student to apply for national certification in music therapy (MT-BC).    There is a maximum of 60 credits required for MA students who have no previous music therapy certification. For those who are already certified and entering the masters program, there is a requirement of 48 credits for New York State licensure.    The number of credits is contingent upon evaluation and advisement; each student is assigned an advisor at the beginning of the first semester of study. In order to ensure that pre-requisites and competencies have been met, evaluations occur at the audition/interview before enrollment, as well as after the first year of study.

New York University's \"school of music\" has historically been housed in the Steinhardt School. Music programs were created in The Steinhardt School in 1925, approximately 40 years before the creation of NYU's (Tisch) School of the Arts. Consequently, all degrees in music performance at NYU -- baccalaureate through doctoral -- are housed in The Steinhardt School. Steinhardt's music performance programs in voice (classical and music theatre), piano, strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and jazz instruments are internationally recognized. Steinhardt provides intense music performance training along with top-tier music academic courses within the context of a world-renowned university.    Additional undergraduate and/or graduate music degrees are offered in Steinhardt in Music Composition, Music Business, Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Therapy. With 1,600 music majors and some 400 music faculty, the aggregate of Steinhardt's music programs represent one of the largest \"music schools\" in the United States.    Q. What is the difference between (1) Steinhardt's Music Business and Music Technology programs and (2) Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music?    First, for information regarding Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music, please visit their website . Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded music grants a BFA degree. By way of difference, students majoring in Steinhardt's Music Business Program or Steinhardt's Music Technology Program receive the B.M., the bachelor of music degree. Furthermore, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology students are required to complete an audition and to read music prior to admission to Steinhardt.    In accordance with national standards for undergraduate degrees in music, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are required to complete 16 \"core\" courses, four each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation. That \"core\" curriculum of sixteen courses is not offered in Tisch.    In addition to the \"core\" curriculum, Steinhardt Music Business majors complete a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses in Music Business including internships, along with courses in The Stern School of Business and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences. Steinhardt Music Technology majors complete the sixteen \"core\" courses along with a very substantial number of courses in music technology in our multiple music recording studios and labs, internships, and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences.    Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are often serious performers, composers and producers, who develop those talents through private music instruction with our acclaimed faculty.    While there are longstanding master's programs in Music Business and Music Technology in The Steinhardt School, at present, only the BFA is offered in Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.    Q. What is the difference between a music performance major and a music education major?    Music performance majors in Steinhardt receive \"music conservatory\" training as performers in preparation for careers in music performance. They are not required to take courses in music education, do not participate in student teaching, and are not certified to teach K-12.    Music Education majors in Steinhardt are expected to be outstanding musicians. Undergraduate music education majors have a \"primary instrument\" (instrument or voice), take private lessons throughout their four years, participate in ensembles, and present senior recitals on their primary instrument, very much like music performance majors. However, in addition to intense study in music, music education majors take a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses related to music education, including mentored student teaching assignments. Upon completion of the B.M. degree, Steinhardt music education majors are able to teach K-12 in most states in the U.S. Each state has its own teacher licensing exams and guidelines, which may require completion of a masters&rsquo; degree within five years of completion of the bachelors degree.       Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September. Please click on &ldquo;Auditions&rdquo; in this web site and then click on &ldquo;Current Students&rdquo; and follow instructions.

New York University's \"school of music\" has historically been housed in the Steinhardt School. Music programs were created in The Steinhardt School in 1925, approximately 40 years before the creation of NYU's (Tisch) School of the Arts. Consequently, all degrees in music performance at NYU -- baccalaureate through doctoral -- are housed in The Steinhardt School. Steinhardt's music performance programs in voice (classical and music theatre), piano, strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and jazz instruments are internationally recognized. Steinhardt provides intense music performance training along with top-tier music academic courses within the context of a world-renowned university.    Additional undergraduate and/or graduate music degrees are offered in Steinhardt in Music Composition, Music Business, Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Therapy. With 1,600 music majors and some 400 music faculty, the aggregate of Steinhardt's music programs represent one of the largest \"music schools\" in the United States.    Q. What is the difference between (1) Steinhardt's Music Business and Music Technology programs and (2) Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music?    First, for information regarding Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music, please visit their website . Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded music grants a BFA degree. By way of difference, students majoring in Steinhardt's Music Business Program or Steinhardt's Music Technology Program receive the B.M., the bachelor of music degree. Furthermore, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology students are required to complete an audition and to read music prior to admission to Steinhardt.    In accordance with national standards for undergraduate degrees in music, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are required to complete 16 \"core\" courses, four each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation. That \"core\" curriculum of sixteen courses is not offered in Tisch.    In addition to the \"core\" curriculum, Steinhardt Music Business majors complete a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses in Music Business including internships, along with courses in The Stern School of Business and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences. Steinhardt Music Technology majors complete the sixteen \"core\" courses along with a very substantial number of courses in music technology in our multiple music recording studios and labs, internships, and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences.    Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are often serious performers, composers and producers, who develop those talents through private music instruction with our acclaimed faculty.    While there are longstanding master's programs in Music Business and Music Technology in The Steinhardt School, at present, only the BFA is offered in Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.    Q. What is the difference between a music performance major and a music education major?    Music performance majors in Steinhardt receive \"music conservatory\" training as performers in preparation for careers in music performance. They are not required to take courses in music education, do not participate in student teaching, and are not certified to teach K-12.    Music Education majors in Steinhardt are expected to be outstanding musicians. Undergraduate music education majors have a \"primary instrument\" (instrument or voice), take private lessons throughout their four years, participate in ensembles, and present senior recitals on their primary instrument, very much like music performance majors. However, in addition to intense study in music, music education majors take a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses related to music education, including mentored student teaching assignments. Upon completion of the B.M. degree, Steinhardt music education majors are able to teach K-12 in most states in the U.S. Each state has its own teacher licensing exams and guidelines, which may require completion of a masters&rsquo; degree within five years of completion of the bachelors degree.       Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September. Please click on &ldquo;Auditions&rdquo; in this web site and then click on &ldquo;Current Students&rdquo; and follow instructions.

Our pianists work closely with renowned Artist Faculty in private lessons, participate in our nationally regarded Artist Master Class Series , and perform as solo and collaborative artists at venues throughout New York City.    Course Work    Musical training for B.M. students includes private lessons with Artist Faculty , chamber music coaching with members of top New York ensembles, and three semesters of Piano Literature, in addition to a conservatory-style sequence of courses in music theory, aural comprehension, keyboard harmony and improvisation, and music history. NYU&rsquo;s rich liberal arts offerings promise a lively artistic and intellectual experience for the developing musician.    Required course work includes private lessons and chamber music coachings, as well as courses in piano literature, keyboard skills, music theory, aural comprehension, and music history. Each Spring, students are evaluated in juried performances, and all pianists present full recitals their junior and senior years. The degree requires a 130 credits (40 in the liberal arts and 90 in music), of which more than twenty are electives chosen from a wide array of offerings, ranging from classes in Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Business to Alexander Technique and secondary lessons in jazz, composition, and conducting.    A new dual degree (B.M. Music/M.A. Music Education) is designed for undergraduate performance and composition majors interested in adding a music education component to the four-year degree. Students apply at the end of their sophomore year. Once accepted into the dual degree by the music education faculty, students complete their degree with the added concentration in music education beginning in their junior year. Upon graduation, students may continue to a one-year master's degree in music education, where they complete their supervised student teaching internship to earn initial and professional teaching certification. Please see your current program director before contacting the Music Education program.    Preparation    In today&rsquo;s evolving world of the performing arts, pianists must enter their careers with more skills than ever before.
