The subject of silent film provides a powerful case study for such an inquiry because research on the area has produced some of the most interesting recent works in historical film scholarship. The course is organized into three sections: (1) questions of precinema; (2) the emergence of the story film; and (3) international cinema of the teens. Among the authors studied are Linda Williams, Marta Braun, Jonathan Crary, Yuri Tsivian, Thomas Elsaesser, and Miriam Hansen.
