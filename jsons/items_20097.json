Launched in 2005, the MS program was initiated with the generous support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was the second program of its kind, anywhere. It is the first curriculum to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers that offers a graduate program either on a full-time or part-time basis. The program spans four tracks:      Corporate Finance and Financial Markets    Computational Finance    Information Technology and Algorithmic Finance    Risk Finance     The MS program provides students superior training and skills to bridge theory and practice and to engineer the future of finance by providing students with an IT base to understand and meet the challenges in today&rsquo;s cutting-edge financial services industry and its many associated professions.   In addition, the MS program provides students the opportunity to profit from a broad range of educational resources and opportunities at NYU. Furthermore, the Department seeks local and global collaborations with industry on research projects that allow students to apply their existing knowledge and acquire new insights into the ever-changing world of finance.   The MS in Financial Engineering is a well-established program with a diverse curriculum. Our faculty is comprised of leading financial and risk research, adjunct, industry, and research professors, all with extensive practical expertise, who produce world-class research while teaching both introductory and advanced courses in a small class setting.   The program prepares its graduates to enter fast-moving, highly rewarding careers spanning the many occupations prevalent in financial services and related industries.
