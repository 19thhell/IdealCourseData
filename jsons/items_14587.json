Any 8 units (or more) of course work in a single foreign language will count as one of the two electives for the co-major/concentration. Note: Students may also take any 6-credit intensive language course (e.g. FREN-UA 10, Intensive Elementary French I) to satisfy this requirement.   Non-foreign Language  In general, a non-business elective is one that has some significant impact on business practices of the 21st century. The undergraduate faculty adviser evaluates courses for appropriateness. To request a course evaluation, the international business undergraduate adviser would need to receive the syllabus of the course, in-person or via e-mail, and a description of the request. Applicable courses may, but are not limited to, be offered through the College of Arts and Science , Wagner Graduate School of Public Service , and Tisch School of the Arts .

Many CAS electives require either Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12) or Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) as prerequisites; ECON-UB 1 is accepted as a prerequisite in lieu of ECON-UA 10.    Transfer students, who have not completed ECON-UB 1 at Stern, are required to take Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UB 10) or apply an equivalent course in Intermediate Microeconomics from a previous institution. Intermediate Microeconomics will not satisfy any of the concentration elective requirements.    The following CAS economics courses are not open to Stern students: Economic Principles I or II (ECON-UA 1 or ECON-UA 2); Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10); Statistics (P) (ECON-UA 18); Money and Banking (ECON-UA 231); International Economics (ECON-UA 238); and Financial Economics (ECON-UA 368).

This program of courses relies on a higher level of abstraction and emphasizes the techniques of economic analysis rather than the study of specific economic problems or institutions. It is well-suited for students who intend to pursue a professional career in economics, are considering graduate study in economics, or those pursuing careers or higher degrees in highly quantitative fields such as finance.

Transferring between economics areas can be complex, especially when switching from business economics to the economic theory. You are urged to make this decision early on in their Stern careers.  The list of courses below is divided into three sections:(I) economic theory major courses (anchor to area indicated below), and (II) economics elective courses (anchor to area indicated below). Students in either economics area can choose electives from any list.    Courses listed with a (B) designation indicate that they will count only toward the business economics area. Courses listed with a (T) designation indicate that the course will count only toward the economics theory area. Courses with the notation (B, T) count toward either area.
