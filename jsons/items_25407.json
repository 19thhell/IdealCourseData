Our students know that nearly any academic interest can be met among our more than 230 areas of study. Additionally, NYU students choose from a breadth of international learning experiences\u2014between NYU\u2019s three portal campuses and global academic centers, students can live and study in 14 cities worldwide and gain the perspective of true global citizens and scholars, all while never having to leave the university\u2019s global network. Students can further expand their horizons through the exciting international academic exchange programs offered through partnerships with leading global universities.     International experiences are an integral part of an NYU education, as are opportunities to conduct research, develop professional skills, and cultivate a network of professional and academic colleagues. The knowledge you gain inside the classroom will be combined with practical application in the lab, on set, or in the boardroom.     We invite you to explore every facet of the NYU learning experience, and what it would mean to you. What will you study? Where will you go? What will you discover about yourself?
