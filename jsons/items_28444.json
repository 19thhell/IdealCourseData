Their entire experience of alien environments is mediated by technology. I describe a number of research projects that explore the ways in which immersive virtual reality is considered as a tool to help scientists explore the universe. First, I describe efforts to tele-operate a dexterous manipulator. We find that reduced degrees of freedom performs better than direct manipulation. Second, I describe efforts to develop hypotheses of alien geology. We find that scientists understand the environment better when immersed than using current state-of-the-art stitched panoramic images.      Bio:   Dr. Scott Davidoff is the Human Interfaces Manager at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab.
