The major aligns with the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication's emphasis on the intersections of media and culture as crucial to understanding and navigating an increasingly interconnected world. Students study a variety of topics such as epidemiology, media culture, politics, health policy, technology, and ethics. Students work closely with an MCC adviser to select the right mix of electives to complement individual interests and career paths.    NYU's MCC/GPH major offers undergraduate students a theoretical foundation and practical experience to prepare for entry into a wide range of career fields and graduate study. Popular industry options include: advertising and marketing, public relations, digital media, publishing, public policy, non-profit and government organizations. MCC/GPH graduates also pursue graduate study in areas such as law, business administration, education, public health, social work, and journalism.    Study away for one semester at an NYU Global site is a requirement of the GPH combined major. Download a copy of the MCC/GPH Curriculum Planner .    Global Public Health Majors at New York University    The NYU Global Institute of Public Health (GIPH) crosses disciplinary boundaries to address the world's most pressing health problems. Drawing from resources across NYU's schools, the Institute delivers truly interdisciplinary public health education at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral level. The Institute also supports cutting-edge and collaborative research on public health issues around the world.    The GIPH builds on the global reach of NYU's unique Global Network University; draws strength from the entrepreneurial spirit of NYU's many talented faculty and students; and serves as a conduit for groundbreaking research and education that advances and promotes equitable health for all.    The highly selective, demanding undergraduate majors in Global Public Health (GIPH) allow students to choose a course of study that is a combination of public health and an academic discipline or a professional subject area housed in one of four NYU schools: the College of Arts and Science , the College of Nursing , the Silver School of Social Work , and the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development .    Global Public Health is not a stand-alone major; rather, students in the various combined majors benefit from instructor, advisers, and courses both in their home school and from across the entire University. The unique structure responds to the ever-increasing demand for interdisciplinary public health practitioners both in the U.S. and abroad. The coursework is combined with experiential learning and study away requirements to ensure that students are broadly trained and uniquely prepared for a variety of careers.    In all of these majors, students take one required course in each of the six core public health areas:       Biostatistics    Epidemiology    Health policy    Environmental health    Sociobehavioral health    Internship       Students also take courses in their chosen field within Steinhardt, with the exact number of courses varying by major. Students fill out their coursework with electives in global public health and/or the Steinhardt major field (chosen in consultation with an adviser) to compliment individual interests and career paths and study of a foreign language.
