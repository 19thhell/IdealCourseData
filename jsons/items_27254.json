The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

We discuss the significance of the Italians to design, from the first temporary scenic elements to Serlio and Torelli to the Bibiena family. The course continues with the Paris Opera House, Wagner\u2019s Bayreuth theatre; and the American playhouses of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, and it includes the technological changes during that period. The final aspect of the course focuses on contemporary multiple use and adaptable theatre spaces. Emphasis is placed on how trends in the theatre affect the designs of productions, individuals, and aesthetic and technical innovations.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

We discuss the significance of the Italians to design, from the first temporary scenic elements to Serlio and Torelli to the Bibiena family. The course continues with the Paris Opera House, Wagner\u2019s Bayreuth theatre; and the American playhouses of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, and it includes the technological changes during that period. The final aspect of the course focuses on contemporary multiple use and adaptable theatre spaces. Emphasis is placed on how trends in the theatre affect the designs of productions, individuals, and aesthetic and technical innovations.
