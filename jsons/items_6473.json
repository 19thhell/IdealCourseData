The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Students develop their academic writing skills in innovative First-Year Writing and Research Seminars , explore a variety of genres in Advanced Writing Courses , and experience writing beyond the classroom through the Gallatin Writing Program\u2019s diverse events, publications, and civic engagement projects.   Each year, the Gallatin Writing Program hosts multiple conferences and readings by faculty, students, and guests; educates and employs four undergraduates to serve as Peer Writing Assistants in the Writing Center ; publishes the Gallatin Review , a student-edited journal of student writing and visual art; and maintains Confluence , an online platform for writing, art, and research. The Writing Program also sponsors two major civic engagement projects, the Literacy Project , and Great World Texts . The Literacy Project includes opportunities to tutor at adult literacy sites, mentor at a public high school, and edit the Literacy Review , an annual publication that compiles the best writing by adults from about 50 countries. Through Great World Texts, Gallatin undergraduates mentor public high school students in the study of a canonical text.

Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it. Like Woolf and her contemporaries, we belong to a world where feelings which used to come simple and separate do so no longer, where beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain. Emotions which used to enter the mind whole are now broken up on the threshold. These claims mean that we need to reconceive the very notion of threshold, along with the forms by which makers, in the disciplines available to us, structure the experience of living in relation to any boundary. How we ponder artfulness, Woolf implies, requires expansion, as so many influences which play . . . a large part in life have thus far escaped the novelist and her colleaguesamong them,the power of music, the stimulus of light, the effect on us of the shape of trees or the play of colour. To re-see the shapes whereby we express our contact with life will blur the boundaries between customarily separate art forms, Woolf implies, and involve us in the risks inherent in any attempt to make over, to make again, to make anew. What can the risks in play here teach us? At the service of contemplating that question, we will read work by Jennifer Egan, Rainer Maria Rilke, W.G. Sebald, and Woolf herself. We will listen to music that rethinks what sound, ordered into patterns, can make manifest. We will watch films by Pedro Almodvar, Fran&#1195;ois Ozon, Grant Gee, and Fran&#1195;ois Girard. And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate. By November 8, 2014, please email Bruce Bromley at bdb2@nyu.edu to inquire how to submit what you think of as your finest essay, which will function as your portfolio review. Notice of selection will occur within eight days of your first contact.

As a team, we will head off campus each week to mentor under-served high school students in essay writing. Back on campus, we will have weekly meetings to help us enhance our writing and mentoring skills as we develop our own ideas into essays. We will study writers, artists, and filmmakers whose service and/or community engagement has become a basis for work that documents and reflects on pressing social concerns.           Students require an access code to register for the course. Interested students should contact Laura Weinert-Kendt at law320@nyu.edu .

Those intending to participate in the Undergraduate Research Conference in April are especially encouraged to apply as this course will support that research, writing, and presentation.

The First-Year Program begins with orientation and a variety of events during Welcome Week. At orientation you will meet faculty who will help you to think about your education as an interdisciplinary and independent venture. To help you settle into NYU and Gallatin, orientation also includes many social activities, informal discussions, and other opportunities to help you make new friends and become familiar with NYU and the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood.     First-year students (as well as transfer students who enter with fewer than 32 credits) take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the first-year interdisciplinary seminar, first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar. The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the goals, methods, and philosophy of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme\u2014&quot;The Ancient Hero and the Heroic&quot;; &quot;The Thingliness of Things&quot;; &quot;Capitalism and Democracy&quot;\u2014 that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.     The first-year writing seminar and first-year research seminar constitute a two-semester sequence intended to help students develop their writing and research skills and to prepare them for the kinds of writing they will be doing in their other courses. Rather than attribute the success of excellent writing to a writer\u2019s innate gifts or to some mysterious moment of inspiration, these seminars approach writing as a craft that can be learned by acquiring the skills appropriate for each stage in the writing process (free writing, drafting, revising, polishing). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme\u2014&quot;Aesthetics on Trial&quot;; &quot;Wilderness and Civilization&quot;; &quot;Art and the Dream Life&quot;\u2014with related readings that serve both as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 own essays. Usually, the writing seminar begins with personal and descriptive essays and proceeds to focus on the critical essay. A significant portion of the research seminar is devoted to working on a long research paper, with attention to formulating key questions, choosing and evaluating sources, developing a thesis, structuring the argument as a whole and revising and polishing the final paper.

Students develop their academic writing skills in innovative First-Year Writing and Research Seminars , explore a variety of genres in Advanced Writing Courses , and experience writing beyond the classroom through the Gallatin Writing Program\u2019s diverse events, publications, and civic engagement projects.   Each year, the Gallatin Writing Program hosts multiple conferences and readings by faculty, students, and guests; educates and employs four undergraduates to serve as Peer Writing Assistants in the Writing Center ; publishes the Gallatin Review , a student-edited journal of student writing and visual art; and maintains Confluence , an online platform for writing, art, and research. The Writing Program also sponsors two major civic engagement projects, the Literacy Project , and Great World Texts . The Literacy Project includes opportunities to tutor at adult literacy sites, mentor at a public high school, and edit the Literacy Review , an annual publication that compiles the best writing by adults from about 50 countries. Through Great World Texts, Gallatin undergraduates mentor public high school students in the study of a canonical text.

Variously known as the I, the self, the persona (performed or feigned) or the identity we make or somehow possess, subjectivity as a subject suits writing because it is never fixed. Concern for the self is not, however, a self-centered pursuit. It has served as a medium through which readers and writers have been able to live deeply as historical agents and spiritual beings. Respect for self has flourished since antiquity. The ancients thought self-knowledge was fundamental to everything else, and conscientiousness is understood today as a cornerstone of citizenship. In this seminar we will acquaint ourselves with some landmark texts in the history of the mutable I, observing many artful variations made by key writers in the tradition of reflective autobiography. We will learn how to read these predecessors by moving with their rhythms or by accompanying them in cinematic time. Readings and visual materials have been chosen to be fun, challenging and various. They provide a selective foundation for what might be called the tradition of the individual person as he or she comes to self-awareness. Our readings serve as occasions for written imitation, reflection and improvisation. We will also rely on them as touchstones for our own writing practice.           While readings and films about the self often operate through closeness and disclosure, the best of them are also philosophical and scientific, thereby supporting our balanced objective of working reflectively and working interpretively. Our writing projects will span a variety of positions between a greater self beyond our own selfs mere self (what the poet Paul Valry once called some self miraculously superior to Myself ), and a more distanced assessment of selected, constructed selves from history and literary history.           Some of our readings are already known to us faintly, thanks to the diligent passivity of our cultural subconscious: Augustines Confessions, the first book of Prousts multi-volume oeuvre , Swanns Way ; Nella Larsens slender masterpiece from the Harlem Renaissance period, Passing; literary innovations by modern masters such as Luigi Pirandello, J.L. Borges, Natalia Ginzburg, and John Barth; and thoughtful analyses of performed and counterfeited selves by Judith Butler and R.D. Laing. Beguiling cinematic visions of erased, unreal, elusive, split, vague and plural selves come to us through Bernardo Bertolucci, Ingmar Bergman and Luis Buuel and in Stan Brakhages cinematic adventures into our inner, psychic life.

EXPOS-UA 15 A Spectrum of Essays: Reconceiving Artfulness and its Risks           Credits: 4 Instructor: Bruce Bromley, EWP Prequisite: Portfolio review           At the height of her fame as a mind that reimagines what essays and novels can do, Virginia Woolf presses her fellow makers and readers to consider that every moment is the centre and meeting place of an extraordinary number of perceptions which have not yet been expressed, showing us how life is always and inevitably much richer than we who try to express it. Like Woolf and her contemporaries, we belong to a world where feelings which used to come simple and separate do so no longer, where beauty is part ugliness; amusement part disgust; pleasure part pain. Emotions which used to enter the mind whole are now broken up on the threshold. These claims mean that we need to reconceive the very notion of threshold, along with the forms by which makers, in the disciplines available to us, structure the experience of living in relation to any boundary. How we ponder artfulness, Woolf implies, requires expansion, as so many influences which play . . . a large part in life have thus far escaped the novelist and her colleaguesamong them,the power of music, the stimulus of light, the effect on us of the shape of trees or the play of colour. To re-see the shapes whereby we express our contact with life will blur the boundaries between customarily separate art forms, Woolf implies, and involve us in the risks inherent in any attempt to make over, to make again, to make anew. What can the risks in play here teach us? At the service of contemplating that question, we will read work by Jennifer Egan, Rainer Maria Rilke, W.G. Sebald, and Woolf herself. We will listen to music that rethinks what sound, ordered into patterns, can make manifest. We will watch films by Pedro Almodvar, Fran&#1195;ois Ozon, Grant Gee, and Fran&#1195;ois Girard. And we will work at crafting essays that honor our attempts to amplify what shaped thinking can communicate. By November 8, 2014, please email Bruce Bromley at bdb2@nyu.edu to inquire how to submit what you think of as your finest essay, which will function as your portfolio review. Notice of selection will occur within eight days of your first contact.

As a team, we will head off campus each week to mentor under-served high school students in essay writing. Back on campus, we will have weekly meetings to help us enhance our writing and mentoring skills as we develop our own ideas into essays. We will study writers, artists, and filmmakers whose service and/or community engagement has become a basis for work that documents and reflects on pressing social concerns.           Students require an access code to register for the course. Interested students should contact Laura Weinert-Kendt at law320@nyu.edu .

Those intending to participate in the Undergraduate Research Conference in April are especially encouraged to apply as this course will support that research, writing, and presentation.
