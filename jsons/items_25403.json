Policy   The World Wide Web offers the New York University (NYU) community rich resources for advancing the university\u2019s mission of teaching, learning, research, and community life. Individuals can retrieve materials for use in their classes and scholarly activities as well as present materials for use by others. NYU supports the rights of students and faculty to create and receive educational information available through the Web, in keeping with its principles of academic and intellectual freedom.   Access to the Web is made available to the students, faculty, and eligible staff of NYU as part of the educational computing and networking resources of NYU. Such resources and the ability to create web content are privileges extended to members of the NYU community, within the available resources of NYU, and must be exercised in conformity with all applicable NYU policies and procedures and all applicable federal and state laws.   If any person has any doubt as to the applicability of the policies and procedures referred to herein, such person should contact digital.communications@nyu.edu before taking any action.     II. NYU Policies Concerning Use of Computer Facilities and Creation of Web Content   NYU is a nonprofit educational institution and the use of its facilities, including computer facilities, is limited to the educational and other nonprofit purposes of members of its community (e.g., students, faculty, eligible staff, and alumni).   Accordingly, web content may be created and posted only for the educational and research purposes of the NYU community. No person may include in a web page any advertising materials or other materials relating to business or commercial activities of such person or any third person. The content of any web page and its compliance with applicable policy and law is the sole responsibility of the author.   As a user of NYU's computing services, you must comply with all federal, state, local, and other applicable laws, including those at global sites; all University rules and policies, including the Policy on Responsible Use of NYU Computers and Data ( www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/responsible-use-of-nyu-computers-and-data-policy-on.html ), and all applicable contracts and licenses. NYU reserves the right to change, at any time, and at its sole discretion, the provisions concerning authoring of web content on NYU web properties.   Creation of web content for educational and research purposes might involve incorporation of original works of third parties (e.g., literature, photographs, music, software, film, and video works) that are covered by copyright laws. Web content authors are encouraged to obtain all permissions that may be necessary to incorporate works of third parties in their web content. Use of such works may be permitted by principles of fair use, consistent with the copyright laws.   No person may use the name &quot;NYU&quot; or &quot;New York University,&quot; the name of any school of NYU or any logo or trademark of NYU without first obtaining written permission from NYU's Digital Communications Group ( digital.communications@nyu.edu ). It is permissible, however, for a web content author to identify himself or herself as an NYU community member (e.g., student, faculty, or staff member of NYU), as appropriate.   III. Other Policies   NYU receives its Internet access from NYSERNet ( www.nysernet.org ), and any network activity that leaves NYU's network destined for the Internet, including the posting of all web content, is bound by any policies of NYSERNet. In the event of an inconsistency between NYU's policy and those of NYSERNet, the more restrictive policy shall be observed. NYU does not routinely monitor or edit web content. However, in the event that NYU becomes aware of a violation of NYU policy or law that involves web content, NYU reserves the right to remove it, restrict access to it, or take other action as deemed appropriate by NYU. Any such violation may also lead to disciplinary action in accordance with NYU rules and procedures and referral to local, state, and federal law enforcement authorities.   THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL APPLICABLE LAWS NOR SHOULD IT BE INTERPRETED AS PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE. EACH WEB CONTENT AUTHOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS WITH RESPECT TO HIS OR HER WEB CONTENT.   For more information about creating personal web content, read the NYU Web Guide at www.nyu.edu/webguide . Any questions concerning this policy should be directed to digital.communications@nyu.edu .

Policy   The World Wide Web offers the New York University (NYU) community rich resources for advancing the university\u2019s mission of teaching, learning, research, and community life. Individuals can retrieve materials for use in their classes and scholarly activities as well as present materials for use by others. NYU supports the rights of students and faculty to create and receive educational information available through the Web, in keeping with its principles of academic and intellectual freedom.   Access to the Web is made available to the students, faculty, and eligible staff of NYU as part of the educational computing and networking resources of NYU. Such resources and the ability to create web content are privileges extended to members of the NYU community, within the available resources of NYU, and must be exercised in conformity with all applicable NYU policies and procedures and all applicable federal and state laws.   If any person has any doubt as to the applicability of the policies and procedures referred to herein, such person should contact digital.communications@nyu.edu before taking any action.     II. NYU Policies Concerning Use of Computer Facilities and Creation of Web Content   NYU is a nonprofit educational institution and the use of its facilities, including computer facilities, is limited to the educational and other nonprofit purposes of members of its community (e.g., students, faculty, eligible staff, and alumni).   Accordingly, web content may be created and posted only for the educational and research purposes of the NYU community. No person may include in a web page any advertising materials or other materials relating to business or commercial activities of such person or any third person. The content of any web page and its compliance with applicable policy and law is the sole responsibility of the author.   As a user of NYU's computing services, you must comply with all federal, state, local, and other applicable laws, including those at global sites; all University rules and policies, including the Policy on Responsible Use of NYU Computers and Data ( www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/responsible-use-of-nyu-computers-and-data-policy-on.html ), and all applicable contracts and licenses. NYU reserves the right to change, at any time, and at its sole discretion, the provisions concerning authoring of web content on NYU web properties.   Creation of web content for educational and research purposes might involve incorporation of original works of third parties (e.g., literature, photographs, music, software, film, and video works) that are covered by copyright laws. Web content authors are encouraged to obtain all permissions that may be necessary to incorporate works of third parties in their web content. Use of such works may be permitted by principles of fair use, consistent with the copyright laws.   No person may use the name &quot;NYU&quot; or &quot;New York University,&quot; the name of any school of NYU or any logo or trademark of NYU without first obtaining written permission from NYU's Digital Communications Group ( digital.communications@nyu.edu ). It is permissible, however, for a web content author to identify himself or herself as an NYU community member (e.g., student, faculty, or staff member of NYU), as appropriate.   III. Other Policies   NYU receives its Internet access from NYSERNet ( www.nysernet.org ), and any network activity that leaves NYU's network destined for the Internet, including the posting of all web content, is bound by any policies of NYSERNet. In the event of an inconsistency between NYU's policy and those of NYSERNet, the more restrictive policy shall be observed. NYU does not routinely monitor or edit web content. However, in the event that NYU becomes aware of a violation of NYU policy or law that involves web content, NYU reserves the right to remove it, restrict access to it, or take other action as deemed appropriate by NYU. Any such violation may also lead to disciplinary action in accordance with NYU rules and procedures and referral to local, state, and federal law enforcement authorities.   THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL APPLICABLE LAWS NOR SHOULD IT BE INTERPRETED AS PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE. EACH WEB CONTENT AUTHOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS WITH RESPECT TO HIS OR HER WEB CONTENT.   For more information about creating personal web content, read the NYU Web Guide at www.nyu.edu/webguide . Any questions concerning this policy should be directed to digital.communications@nyu.edu .
