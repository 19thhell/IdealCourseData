He went back to the Sapienza for his PhD, and spent the years 2010-11 at the University of Cambridge (Gonville and Caius College) as visiting student. After receiving his Phd in 2012 he was awarded a research scholarship by the Scuola Normale Superiore (Collaboratore di Ricerca) for the academic year 2012/13. He joined the Department of Classics at New York University in 2013. His main research interests lie in the field of Roman epic (Virgil, Lucan, Statius), with special attention to the interactions of poetry and the political world. He is also interested in the poetry of Lucretius and its impact on later imperial literature, the influence of Hellenistic culture on Rome and its literary production, the visual landscape of Rome and its interactions with texts. His first book, entitled Statius\u2019 Thebaid and the destiny of the Empire will be published by Oxford University Press in 2015. This monograph combines an analysis of Statius\u2019 relationship with his epic predecessors with a fresh examination of the complex ways in which the transformations of imperial ideology under the Flavians inflect Statius\u2019 poetic language and epic design. His next book project is on Republican memories in Virgil\u2019s Aeneid . This research, stemming from his participation in the Memoria Romana Project, has issued in a number of preliminary articles (in CPh , SIFC and conference volumes). The aim of this book is to uncover a thick web of proleptic allusions to Republican history in Virgil\u2019s text, thereby providing new readings of key passages, but also to investigate more broadly Virgil\u2019s indebtedness to the political and literary culture of the Republic. To this end, the book combines analysis of literary sources with an investigation of the material culture and the monumental landscape of Republican and Augustan Rome. Currently, he is working on the political uses of myth in late Republican Rome, especially Republican adaptations of Theban stories (both literary and monumental) and how they shed new light on a little studied chain of allusions to Thebes and its heroes in the second half of the Aeneid . The final outcome of this research will be a monograph, tentatively entitled Res publica restituta: Virgil, Augustus and the memory of the Republic . He is also particularly fascinated by the poetry of Lucretius, and he is preparing an article on Lucretius\u2019 political theory and its relationship with Cicero\u2019s De re publica . Stafano has taught language courses at all levels, general courses in translation and graduate courses. He likes to teach undergraduate courses on broad subjects pertaining to the ancient world (e.g. \u201cApocalypse now: reading decline and the end of the world in ancient cultures\u201d). He is particularly interested in courses which favour a multi-disciplinary approach and have connections with ongoing trends in contemporary culture and literature. In 2013/4 he taught an undergraduate seminar in translation on texts and monuments of the Augustan period (\u201cAeneas among the ruins: reading Augustan literature and its monuments\u201d), and two undergraduate courses in Latin poetry, one on Silver Latin Epic (Lucan and Statius) and one on Propertius (books 3 and 4). For the future, he would like to teach a graduate course on Lucretius\u2019 De rerum natura and its reception, as well as a course on Senecan drama and its impact on later Latin literature.

His research typically combines close reading in the tradition of Classical philology with approaches deriving from a dialogue with modern literary theory. He is also interested in the interaction of literary texts and other forms of cultural production (art, documents, maps, inscriptions, monuments). His recent activity includes the Sather Centennial lecture (March 2014 at the University of California, Berkeley; text posted on the website of UCB Classics) and the editing of a complete series of commentaries on Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses : this multi-author work, published by the Fondazione Valla in Italy, is concluded by Philip Hardie\u2019s commentary on Met . 13-5, expected in 2015.

His new projects include book versions of lecture series he gave over the last decade or so: a book on Rome and Italy in the Aeneid (The war for Italia), based on his 2012 Sather Classical Lectures; a comparative study of divine councils in epic from Mesopotamia to early modern Europe, based on his 2012 Martin Lectures at Oberlin College; an essay on space and politics in Roman poetry (Vergilian Geopoetics), deriving from his 2002 Gray Lectures at Cambridge; and a book on Apuleius, anticipated in lectures given at Brown (Robinson Lecture, 2013) and the Institute for Classical Studies in London (Third Rome/London Lecture, 2014). Some of his previous work, especially on Virgil, Horace, and Ovid, concerns literary allusion in narrative texts ( La Traccia del Modello , Pisa 1984, adapted as Homeric Effects in Vergilian Narrative , forthcoming Princeton UP), self-reflexivity ( Speaking Volumes , London 2001), poetry and politics in Ovid\u2019s Fasti and Metamorphoses ( The Poet and the Prince , Berkeley 1997; Phaethon and the Monsters , 2010), time and performance in Horace\u2019s lyric and Epodes (papers in the Cambridge Companions to Horace and to Greek Lyric ; papers in Oxford Readings on Horace\u2019s Odes and on Horace\u2019s Epodes ), the relationship of art and poetry in Augustan culture (papers in Cambridge Companions to Vergil and to the Augustan Age ), allusions to Simonides in Horace, allusions to Callimachus in Roman poetry (paper in Brill\u2019s Companion to Callimachus ), Ovid\u2019s version of pastoral poetry (in Brill\u2019s Companion to Ancient Pastoral ), intertextuality in Petronius and in Apuleius (paper in Oxford Readings on the Roman Novel , and others), the poetics of Roman Imperial epic, the theory and practice of genre in antiquity and in modern literary criticism, narratology (a chapter in the Cambridge Companion to Ovid ). Other academic activities include work for the Fondazione Valla in Rome (administrative and scientific board), refereeing for European Community projects, and being a general editor of the journal SIFC (a journal for classical scholarship, based in Florence).
