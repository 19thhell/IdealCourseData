In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                                                                    Paper Art: History and Practice CCCF-SHU 127 - 4 points                                Beginning with the Chinese arts of Zhezhi (paper folding) and Jianzhi (paper cutting) the paper craft movement has roots on all continents. This course reviews the history of both Chinese and international traditions, in addition to examining contemporary practices. Additionally, students will have hands-on experience through weekly exercises in the fundamentals of paper engineering techniques and basic conductive materials, creating movable books and sculptures.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.

These include calligraphy, ink painting, scroll rendering, landscape sculpture, and birds eye perspective in the present time. Students will examine the content of artwork, including ideas in contemporary and traditional art, both Chinese and international, and build various skills to translate ideas into reality. A journal will be kept to record ideas, sketches, references and future plans. The course includes a study of ancient Chinese paintings, drawings of still-lifes and live models, as well as visits to local artists, galleries, and museums. Class time will be devoted to individual projects and critiques, lectures, and group discussions. As a final project, students will integrate their living experiences in Shanghai with personal experience and/or the societal landscape, to create a substantial body of artwork for a group exhibition. This course is open to students who have an art background or upon the approval of the professors.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                                                                    Paper Art: History and Practice CCCF-SHU 127 - 4 points                                Beginning with the Chinese arts of Zhezhi (paper folding) and Jianzhi (paper cutting) the paper craft movement has roots on all continents. This course reviews the history of both Chinese and international traditions, in addition to examining contemporary practices. Additionally, students will have hands-on experience through weekly exercises in the fundamentals of paper engineering techniques and basic conductive materials, creating movable books and sculptures.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.

What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Great Ideas in Mathematics - MATH-SHU 10 - 4 points                               This one semester course serves as an introduction to great ideas in mathematics. During the course we will examine a variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. 1) A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? 2) Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? 3) Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa!). 4) Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. 5) Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding? Why is math a liberal art?                                                                    Linear Algebra I - MATH-SHU 117 - 4 points                               Linear systems appear throughout the applied sciences; examples include chemical equations, electrical networks, and heat distribution.

Prerequisite: CCSC-110.                            Social Foundations                                                  Global Cultural Heritage - CCSF-SHU 125 - 4 points                               In this course we explore the special place of &quot;cultural heritage&quot; in global life today. We will trace the journeys of cultural heritage items around the world \u2014 from the war trophies and curiosity cabinets of history, to our modern era\u2019s museums, and the global movements in antiquities, art, and other objects from the global South to collectors and museums in the global North, through looting, smuggling, and trade. Topics we\u2019ll investigate include &quot;biographical objects&quot; and the anthropology and psychology of collecting; the social life of objects of desire; the construction of value and knowledge in the representation and display of such objects; the beginnings of museums and their global spread; the concepts of national and global cultural heritage; as well as a series of ongoing international legal and moral battles over heritage, including cases related to China.                                                                    Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict?

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                                                                    Paper Art: History and Practice CCCF-SHU 127 - 4 points                                Beginning with the Chinese arts of Zhezhi (paper folding) and Jianzhi (paper cutting) the paper craft movement has roots on all continents. This course reviews the history of both Chinese and international traditions, in addition to examining contemporary practices. Additionally, students will have hands-on experience through weekly exercises in the fundamentals of paper engineering techniques and basic conductive materials, creating movable books and sculptures.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      The Concept of China - GCHN-SHU 110 - 4 points                               From the Warring States period to the present, what have Chinese and others understood to be the meaning of \u201cChina,\u201d and what have been the broad implications of this understanding? This course is divided into four chronological periods: Antiquity\u2014from the period of the \u2018central kingdoms\u2019 to the formation of the early empire; Middle Period\u2014China Among Equals; Early Modern: 1350-1910\u2014China, Global Trade, and Imperialism; Modern: 1910-present\u2014China Redux                                                                      Digital Chinese Humanities - GCHN-SHU 201 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to computational thinking with specific reference to Global China Studies, and provides a foundation for future research. Areas of focus may include the creation, enhancement, and analysis of digitized written texts, especially primary sources; methodologies for the use of the internet as a research and translation tool; the production and processing of photographs: audio recordings: video clips: and geospatial data. Prerequisite: None.                          Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.                          Interactive Media and Technology                                                    Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Great Ideas in Mathematics - MATH-SHU 10 - 4 points                               This one semester course serves as an introduction to great ideas in mathematics. During the course we will examine a variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. 1) A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? 2) Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? 3) Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa!). 4) Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. 5) Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding? Why is math a liberal art?                                                                    Linear Algebra I - MATH-SHU 117 - 4 points                               Linear systems appear throughout the applied sciences; examples include chemical equations, electrical networks, and heat distribution.

Prerequisite: CCSC-110.                            Social Foundations                                                  Global Cultural Heritage - CCSF-SHU 125 - 4 points                               In this course we explore the special place of &quot;cultural heritage&quot; in global life today. We will trace the journeys of cultural heritage items around the world \u2014 from the war trophies and curiosity cabinets of history, to our modern era\u2019s museums, and the global movements in antiquities, art, and other objects from the global South to collectors and museums in the global North, through looting, smuggling, and trade. Topics we\u2019ll investigate include &quot;biographical objects&quot; and the anthropology and psychology of collecting; the social life of objects of desire; the construction of value and knowledge in the representation and display of such objects; the beginnings of museums and their global spread; the concepts of national and global cultural heritage; as well as a series of ongoing international legal and moral battles over heritage, including cases related to China.                                                                    Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?
