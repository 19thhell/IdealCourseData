The Relational Orientation faculty hopes  that you find a personal and theoretical home here, one in which your own  professional development can deepen and flourish.            The  Relational Orientation has moved away from an emphasis on the role of  endogenous drives and \"one person\" psychologies toward a study of the  continuous interface of intrapsychic and Relational influences in and outside  the clinical situation. We come to the Relational position from a range  of theoretical orientations including Freudian, Object Relations, Self  Psychology and Interpersonal theories, and you will see evidence of these  earlier traditions in the courses you take with us. Relational ideas have  many roots from other disciplines that include [but are not limited to] social  constructivist and feminist theories, theories of intersubjectivity, infancy  and attachment research.            Relational  psychoanalysis focuses attention on processes of mutual influence in  development and treatment. We assume that relationships, including the analytic  one, are shaped by both individuals  in a process that is neither one sided nor linear. In this and  other ways Relational theorizing profoundly alters the analyst's thinking about  clinical work. We invite you to join us in studying older as well as  contemporary contributions to this orientation.      We offer courses that study the roots of Relational thinking in earlier  traditions \u2013 Freud, Klein, Bion, Fairbairn, Ferenczi, Kohut and Winnicott  - as well as contemporary theorizing. While some of our courses are  primarily theoretical in emphasis and others mainly clinical, all of our  courses address developments and controversies in clinical technique.            In  addition to coursework, the Relational Orientation offers many opportunities  for candidates to become involved during their training at Postdoc.   Friday night Colloquia, workshops and Sunday brunches in which you will get to  hear faculty and graduates present their work are ongoing events provided at no  cost to the candidates. Also, candidates are encouraged to join the  Relational Orientation via active participation in all aspects of programming,  including the executive committee, faculty selection committee, colloquium  committee, as well as program wide committees such as the yearly weekend  retreat planning committee, admissions committee and outreach committee.      Candidates who seek a thorough grounding in Relational thinking will be  provided with a suggested (but not required) that we believe will best build  your knowledge base. See below for the course sequence  recommendations. But regardless of the primary orientation to which you  subscribe, we warmly encourage you to sample our courses.

In particular, sparse representations, i.e. representations with only few non-zero components,  are desirable because they can be learned very efficiently and they can be easier to discriminate.  In our work, we have proposed many unsupervised algorithms to learn sparse representations  with applications to handwriting recognition, generic visual object recognition,  image denoising and image compression.      Learning Applied to Ground Robots   Raia Hadsell (CMU), Pierre Sermanet (NYU), Marco Scoffier (NYU, Net-Scale Technologies), Chris Crudelle (Net-Scale Technologies), Matt Grimes (NYU), Koray Kavukcuoglu (NYU), Yann LeCun (NYU), Urs Muller (Net-Scale Technologies)             The purpose of the LAGR project is to design vision and learning algorithms to allow the robot to navigate in complex outdoors environment solely from camera input. Our team is one of 10 participants in the program funded by DARPA. Each LAGR team received identical copies of the LAGR robot, built be the National Robotics Engineering Consortium at Carnegie Mellon University. The government periodically runs competitions between the teams. The software from each team is loaded and run by the goverment team on their robot. The robot is given the GPS coordinates of a goal to which it must drive as fast as possible. The terrain is unknown in advance. The robot is run three times through the test course. The software can use the knowledge acquired during the early runs to improve the performance on the latter runs.    A complete long-range vision and navigation system was developed and allows the robot to dramatically improve its autonomous navigation performances, by learning the long-range appearance of obstacles using short-range stereo examples. The robot can thus adapt to completely new environments. In addition to learning obstacles, the robot learns its control by remembering possible trajectories which allows a smooth and optimized local obstacle avoidance. Additionally, an efficient long-range mapping and path planning allows real-time planning over a very large visual space, and a cheap visual odometry corrects for pose errors. All those efficient modules are integrated in a multiple perception/planning layer architecture that makes the navigation reactive and collision-free as well as long-range.      Factor Graphs for Relational Learning   Sumit Chopra (NYU), Trivikaraman Thampy (NYU), John Leahy (NYU, Economics), Andrew Caplin (NYU, Economics), Yann LeCun (NYU)          Many interesting regression problems possess a rich underlying inter-sample relational structure.  In these problems, the samples may be related to each other in ways such that the unknown variables associated with any sample not only depends on its individual attributes, but also on the variables associated with related samples. One such problem, whose importance is further emphasized by the present economic crises, is understanding real estate prices. The price of a house clearly depends on its individual attributes, such as, the number of bedrooms. However, the price also depends on the neighborhood in which the house lies and on the time period in which it was sold. Uncovering these spatio-temporal dependencies can help better understand house prices, while at the same time improving prediction accuracy.     Problems of this nature fall in the domain of \"Statistical Relational Learning\". However the drawback of most models proposed so far is that they cater only to classification problems. We propose \"Relational Factor Graph\" models for doing regression in relational data and apply it for predicting house prices and constructing house price indices. The relational aspect of the model accounts for the hidden spatio-temporal influences on the price of every house. The dataset used is industry standard, consisting of around 1.3 million transaction in Los Angeles County spanning 24 years. Experiments show that one can achieve considerably superior performance by identifying and using the underlying spatio-temporal structure associated with the problem."}]}]
