Description     This course takes us from New York to Havana and back again. We begin in the classroom. During two intensive weekends we will explore Cuba's history, politics, economy, and society through selected readings, special guest lecturers, and recorded media. We begin by considering the colonial origins of Cuba's first revolution and the neocolonial period that inspired Castro's socialist revolution. We then turn to Cuba's present, discussing its political and economic system, and its international relations. We will also consider the major social implications of the Cuban Revolution - health and education, gender roles, and culture. We then travel to Havana to experience the Cuban reality first-hand. Upon our arrival in Havana, we will work in collaboration with the Ludwig Foundation Center, a non-governmental organization dedicated to bridging understanding in Cuba and abroad through cultural exchange--to translate our academic discussion into an in-depth field study. Students will gain exclusive exposure to an &ldquo;inside out&rdquo; perspective of a country that is most often viewed from the &ldquo;outside in.&rdquo; The seminar will be composed of organized lectures, site visits and meetings at local organizations and educational institutions. Students will also have the opportunity to engage in targeted one-to-one and small group meetings with specialists and academics related their planned research projects.         Faculty     Arturo Lopez-Levy is a visiting lecturer at Mills College, Oakland, California. He is also a Doctoral Candidate (ABD) at the Josef School of International Studies of the University of Denver.

He is a member of the Academic Board of Cuban Studies, the premier journal of studies about Cuba in the United States. In 2005, Lopez-Levy received the Leonard Marks Foreign Policy Award of the American Academy of Diplomacy.

Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

Description     This course takes us from New York to Havana and back again. We begin in the classroom. During two intensive weekends we will explore Cuba's history, politics, economy, and society through selected readings, special guest lecturers, and recorded media. We begin by considering the colonial origins of Cuba's first revolution and the neocolonial period that inspired Castro's socialist revolution. We then turn to Cuba's present, discussing its political and economic system, and its international relations. We will also consider the major social implications of the Cuban Revolution - health and education, gender roles, and culture. We then travel to Havana to experience the Cuban reality first-hand. Upon our arrival in Havana, we will work in collaboration with the Ludwig Foundation Center, a non-governmental organization dedicated to bridging understanding in Cuba and abroad through cultural exchange--to translate our academic discussion into an in-depth field study. Students will gain exclusive exposure to an &ldquo;inside out&rdquo; perspective of a country that is most often viewed from the &ldquo;outside in.&rdquo; The seminar will be composed of organized lectures, site visits and meetings at local organizations and educational institutions. Students will also have the opportunity to engage in targeted one-to-one and small group meetings with specialists and academics related their planned research projects.         Faculty     Arturo Lopez-Levy is a visiting lecturer at Mills College, Oakland, California. He is also a Doctoral Candidate (ABD) at the Josef School of International Studies of the University of Denver.

He has published articles about Cuba, Latin America, and the U.S. policy towards Latin America at Foreign Policy, Foreign Policy in Focus, The International Journal of Cuban Studies, The Chicago Tribune, The Florida Sun Sentinel, The Baltimore Sun, the Miami Herald and other American and international newspapers. Lopez-Levy is a political analyst in CNN Spanish and frequent guest at radio and TV programs in the U.S. and the international media. He has Master degrees in Economics from Carleton University (Ottawa) and in International Affairs from Columbia University (NYC). He has been a fellow of the Inter-American Dialogue, the Aspen Institute and the New America Foundation. He is a member of the Academic Board of Cuban Studies, the premier journal of studies about Cuba in the United States. In 2005, Lopez-Levy received the Leonard Marks Foreign Policy Award of the American Academy of Diplomacy.         Site     The majority of program lectures will take place at NYU&rsquo;s partner institution in Havana, The Ludwig Foundation. The Ludwig Foundation of Cuba (LFC) is an autonomous, non-governmental and non-profit institution in Cuba created to protect and promote contemporary Cuban artists and culture, develop research works and new technologies applied to the artistic field, and encourage dialog with both Cuban and international cultural communities. LFC acts as a cultural center to encourage the creation of bridges of understanding in Cuba and abroad. LFC has established long-term programs with leading institutions worldwide. Programs include performances, festivals, exhibitions, exchanges, lectures, seminars, academic courses, workshops, conferences, scholarships and grants.

Established in 1958 as NYU's first global academic center, NYU Madrid offers students with little or no Spanish language skills a Fast-Track Spanish for Beginners program that includes a set of four courses designed to bring them to proficiency in one semester. During the spring semester, students with advanced Spanish language skills may enroll in up to two courses at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). Homestays with Spanish host families encourage students to build a deeper connection with Spanish culture and provides an opportunity to practice speaking in a more casual environment. An Intercambio Program brings NYU Madrid students together with local college students to practice their Spanish and make friends.       Madrid is the political and cultural center of Spain and one of the liveliest and friendliest capital cities in Europe, replete with magnificent architecture, world-class museums, and delicious cuisine. Students at NYU Madrid enjoy a semester of rich cultural experiences that complement their studies, whether they\u2019re on a class trip to the Museo del Prado to learn firsthand about Goya's masterpieces or at an out-of-the way tapas bar on Cava Baja.

The buildings, which have been newly restructured, feature modern classrooms, computer facilities with E-mail and wireless access to the Internet, and a charming patio. Students explore Hispanic culture, history, and society while immersed in the life of this vibrant city, the capital of the Hispanic world.   NYU Madrid has a reading room of approximately 1,500 books and a collection of DVDs. These holdings include books on literature, art, history, and other subjects, in Spanish and in English.        Intercambios / Language Exchange Program   Intercambios are language exchanges in which young Spaniards are paired with you through NYU. You can meet with your intercambio as often as you like, but the goal is to practice speaking Spanish in a relaxed and informal atmosphere. Also, it\u2019s a great way to get introduced to other Spanish kids your age. Highly recommended program.
