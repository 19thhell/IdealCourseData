The two-year program provides students with private studios and access to facilities in painting, printmaking, ceramics, photography, digital media, and sculpture.    Description    The program has no restrictions on media, and students are encouraged to work with whatever formal means are best suited to their ideas. During the course of study, students engage in a team-taught interdisciplinary critique class each semester, as well as one full afternoon each week of individual studio meetings with visiting artists, critics and full-time and visiting faculty. Students study with faculty who are acclaimed artists, critics, and writers with diverse interests and disciplines who see teaching as an integral part of an ongoing and influential creative practice. Drawn from the surrounding New York art-world, yet deeply engaged with their students, the relationship between the faculty and students represents the core of the MFA community. The MFA studios are located in the Art Department&rsquo;s six-story Beaux-Arts Building at 34 Stuyvesant Street in the East Village. The building also houses facilities for painting, sculpture, photography, computer art, video, performance, ceramics, metalsmithing, sewing, and printmaking. All studios, shops, and labs are available to MFA students and courses may be taken in any of these areas.  The Visiting Artist Lecture Series is held each Thursday evening following the afternoon studio visits. Lectures are open to the public and visitors are welcome. MFA Students plan Open Studio events that can combine performances, festivities, and exhibitions.  MFA Thesis Exhibitions are held in late spring at the Art Department&rsquo;s 80WSE Gallery. During their final semester, students select a committee of three artists or critics to work with them during the final stages of their exhibition and written thesis. (Note: 80WSE Gallery was included by Jerry Saltz on Vulture and in New York Magazine as one of The 19 Best Art Shows of 2014 in NYC.)    Program Goals and Mission    The MFA program is dedicated to assisting student artists in developing their work via an approach that is intensely introspective while collectively open to the challenges and issues of the larger world. The program asks students to consider, both critically and irreverently, their own practices and assumptions, as well as those of the contemporary art world, and to pursue their visions to the point of excess as needed. Designed to be small, the program provides ample opportunity for individual attention and critique. The program is non-restrictive to encourage students to work with whatever media or formal means are best suited to their ideas.    Student Learning Outcomes    Students will:       Analyze and examine the process of artistic production through guidance and critique with faculty, visiting artists, curators and critics.    Develop critical thinking as it applies to the conceptual and aesthetic foundation of individual studio practice.    Communicate clearly and effectively both verbally and in writing the link between theory and individual artistic practice with specific attention to historical and cultural contexts.    Synthesize critique and intellectual reflection into individual artistic production culminating in a thesis exhibition of contemporary and critical relevance.
