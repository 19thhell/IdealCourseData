Semester: Spring, Summer       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Introduction to Community Organizing is for those who could imagine running national or local advocacy organizations that make change happen or anyone who wants to understand the art of community organizing. It will provide an overview of and training in contemporary community organizing practice in the United States. This includes defining what community organizing is and identifying its value base; exploring the strategies, tactics and activities of organizing; and thinking about marketing, language and evaluation. We also will examine the transformations of civic engagement and voluntary associations in the United States and the impact of these transformations on the ways Americans organize and advocate for change.      But there is a larger lesson here: The skills of community organizing \u2013 listening, finding areas of consensus and building on that consensus, finding ways to make change happen \u2013 are skills that can be applied to all professional and life settings. Through readings, class activities, cases studies, speakers and reflection, students will examine skills and techniques for effective organizing, including building a membership base, developing ordinary people as community leaders and running member-led issue campaigns. Students will also have the opportunity to reflect on and strengthen their own skills as community organizers and advocates.

Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Teddy Roosevelt claimed that the only two ways to get somebody to do what you wanted them to do was to \"shoot 'em or talk 'em to death.\" Saul Alinsky, the great community organizer, had a bit more sophisticated view.   Among his \"Rules for Radicals\" was this one: \"Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.\" This course will range in focus from the theoretical and strategic to the detailed and practical. It will critically examine the major resources available for bringing about human rights change, from public exposure to economic sanctions, from legal challenges to military intervention, and it will help students learn to formulate and evaluate organizing efforts to foster change at the global, regional, national and local levels. By the end of the course we will have added a myriad of techniques to Roosevelt's two and learned how, a la Alinsky, to exploit our adversaries' misperceptions as readily as we do their strategic blunders.
