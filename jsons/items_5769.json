The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The long affiliation between NYU and Bellevue Hospital has enabled the program to fulfill its mission in training postdoctoral students to become leaders in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan.   Didactic training in biomedical sciences takes place at the College of Dentistry and the Medical Center. A wealth of clinical experience is achieved at the affiliate teaching hospitals. These include Tisch Hospital - NYU Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital and The Harbor Healthcare System - Veterans Administration Hospital.   Learning Goals for the Program   Read complete Learning Goals and Objectives here &gt;&gt;&gt;   Accreditation Status   The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Each year two applicants are accepted into the six-year OMS/MD program and one applicant is accepted into the four-year OMS certificate program.   Residency Program Objectives   The objective of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program is to prepare graduates for a successful and productive career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The curriculum is designed to develop the clinical, academic, and communicative skills that will provide for diversified career options. The educational experience is progressive in nature offering increasing responsibilities as residents proceed through the program. A unique feature of this program is immediate participation in all aspects of patient care.   Graduates of the program will be prepared to pursue contemporary full scope Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery practice, obtain medical New York state licensure (6-year residents), and be prepared for the rigors of specialty board examination.   Program Outline   Six Year Residency/ Integrated MD Curriculum   The six-year integrated MD training program has been developed to prepare the graduated dentist an academic and/ or private practice career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. It is an integrated clinical and didactic program designed to meet the requirements leading to certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Upon completion of the residency program, the candidate will receive a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, a certificate of completion for one year of General Surgery residency, and a specialty certificate in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Students/ residents enrolled in medical school are responsible for the tuition costs.   The didactic training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery begins with postgraduate courses in craniofacial development, head and neck anatomy, bone biology, and physical diagnosis. These essential foundation courses are supplemented by certification in ACLS, PALS, and ATLS. Each Tuesday morning is dedicated to selected topics in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This includes but is not limited to:     Maxillofacial Trauma   Pathologic lesions of the head and neck   Correction of dentofacial deformities   Maxillofacial Reconstruction   Temporomandibular joint surgery   Dentoalveolar surgery   Ambulatory general anesthesia and deep sedation   Cleft lip and palate repair   Management of odontogenic infections   Dental implants   Management of facial pain   Facial aesthetic surgery   Coding and nomenclature   Risk management     Monday morning attending conference reviews each case from the preceding week. The Chair and faculty in the Pathology Department at the College teach Oral Pathology two times a month.   In addition, there are regularly scheduled multidisciplinary conferences in dentofacial deformities, facial trauma, craniofacial-cleft lip and palate, and Head and Neck Tumor Board.                                                  Year One                               The first year of the program consists of six months on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service and six months in the C 21 Medical School Curriculum. Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C 21, provides students with patient- centered and diseased- focused medical education. Please visit http://school.med.nyu.edu for further information.

The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery dates back to 1867, when the first organized course in oral surgery was offered by what was then known as the New York College of Dentistry. The long affiliation between NYU and Bellevue Hospital has enabled the program to fulfill its mission in training postdoctoral students to become leaders in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Many surgeons responsible for the changing face of the specialty were also leaders of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, among them Drs. Leo Winter, Harry Seldin, and William Harrigan.   Didactic training in biomedical sciences takes place at the College of Dentistry and the Medical Center. A wealth of clinical experience is achieved at the affiliate teaching hospitals. These include Tisch Hospital - NYU Medical Center, Lenox Hill Hospital and The Harbor Healthcare System - Veterans Administration Hospital.   Learning Goals for the Program   Read complete Learning Goals and Objectives here &gt;&gt;&gt;   Accreditation Status   The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. Each year two applicants are accepted into the six-year OMS/MD program and one applicant is accepted into the four-year OMS certificate program.   Residency Program Objectives   The objective of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program is to prepare graduates for a successful and productive career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The curriculum is designed to develop the clinical, academic, and communicative skills that will provide for diversified career options. The educational experience is progressive in nature offering increasing responsibilities as residents proceed through the program. A unique feature of this program is immediate participation in all aspects of patient care.   Graduates of the program will be prepared to pursue contemporary full scope Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery practice, obtain medical New York state licensure (6-year residents), and be prepared for the rigors of specialty board examination.   Program Outline   Six Year Residency/ Integrated MD Curriculum   The six-year integrated MD training program has been developed to prepare the graduated dentist an academic and/ or private practice career in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. It is an integrated clinical and didactic program designed to meet the requirements leading to certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Upon completion of the residency program, the candidate will receive a medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, a certificate of completion for one year of General Surgery residency, and a specialty certificate in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Students/ residents enrolled in medical school are responsible for the tuition costs.   The didactic training in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery begins with postgraduate courses in craniofacial development, head and neck anatomy, bone biology, and physical diagnosis. These essential foundation courses are supplemented by certification in ACLS, PALS, and ATLS. Each Tuesday morning is dedicated to selected topics in oral and maxillofacial surgery. This includes but is not limited to:     Maxillofacial Trauma   Pathologic lesions of the head and neck   Correction of dentofacial deformities   Maxillofacial Reconstruction   Temporomandibular joint surgery   Dentoalveolar surgery   Ambulatory general anesthesia and deep sedation   Cleft lip and palate repair   Management of odontogenic infections   Dental implants   Management of facial pain   Facial aesthetic surgery   Coding and nomenclature   Risk management     Monday morning attending conference reviews each case from the preceding week. The Chair and faculty in the Pathology Department at the College teach Oral Pathology two times a month.   In addition, there are regularly scheduled multidisciplinary conferences in dentofacial deformities, facial trauma, craniofacial-cleft lip and palate, and Head and Neck Tumor Board.                                                  Year One                               The first year of the program consists of six months on the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service and six months in the C 21 Medical School Curriculum. Curriculum for the 21st Century, or C 21, provides students with patient- centered and diseased- focused medical education. Please visit http://school.med.nyu.edu for further information.
