All the art in the game is made from needle felted wool and stop motion animated. I hand dyed all the wool using natural and vegetable dyes, including dye plants grown in my garden, and I locally sourced some of the wool here in New York City from the cotswold sheep raised at the Queens County Farm. In addition, the game will be projected onto a sheet of wool giving it extra texture.   Take control of cute, wobbly and wonky felted wool creatures and fight to control all the nests in the sky. Fly around and battle it out against your best friends and mortal enemies. Win a round by capturing all the nests, or by capturing more than your opponent does before the time runs out. Background With Nest, this is the first time I've grown dye plants from seed to dye wool to use in my work. I grew indigo, marigolds, bamboo, basil and used other found plants, flowers, and lichen to use as dyes. I spent a large amount of time learning about natural dyes and experimenting with traditional and folk dyeing techniques.  I also spent time exploring local multiplayer games, both old and new, as well as the current crop of local multiplayer games that are coming out of the NYC indie gaming scene. In addition to the traditional techniques that these types of \"party\" games employ, I wanted to study the theory and \"procedural games\" that we covered in class to expand the possibility of what I could do. I didn't want to just copy what already exists. Audience         My target audience is gamers, kids, and anyone with a love for fiber arts.      User Scenario         Four people walk up to the projection. I hand them each a controller. A round begins, and other people curiously approach and watch. When the round ends, the bystanders eagerly want to join in, and the controllers get passed around. People come and go and play all night.      Implementation         The materials I used are: naturally dyed wool, plastilina, foam. I animated with a Canon t2i with a Canon 50mm macro lens. The game was built in Unity and the code written in C#.       Conclusion         I'm still learning and discovering and breaking things! I learned that adding new features doesn't necessarily make the game better. For example, after I had solidified the core game, I began to add extra elements to spice up the gameplay. Instead of making things more exciting, every *tiny* detail of each element I added completely changed the gameplay and the players' approach and strategy.  I learned that each nuanced addition could drastically change the emergent gameplay and that I have to carefully craft the design of the game."}]},

Students regularly benefit from direct contact with our research faculty and are empowered and encouraged to conduct their own inquiries. All undergraduates at the University are invited to participate in and present their research at the College\u2019s 41st annual Undergraduate Research Conference on Friday, April 24th, 2015. Projects showcasing undergraduate work in the Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Humanities are welcome. The work may have been done in connection with a course or as independent or supervised study.     Click here to download a copy of the April 24th, 2015 Conference Program     Congratulations to the 2015 Undergraduate Research Winners!          In order to help participants prepare for the Conference, we will be hosting a series of presentation workshops, 2 for students doing panel presentations and 2 for students doing poster presentations.     These interactive workshops will focus on both the theoretical and practical aspects of communicating research. Faculty from NYU's Writing in the Disciplines program will facilitate these sessions and fellow undergraduates with experience presenting at conferences will also be on hand to answer questions and provide insights from their own experience. Students attending the sessions are strongly encouraged to bring current drafts of their presentation to receive critique and guidance from fellow students and workshop facilitators.     All workshops will be held in Silver 907 from 5:30-7PM:     Workshops for Panel Presentations:     Wednesday, April 8th     Thursday, April 16th      Workshops for Poster Presentations     Thursday, April 9th     Wednesday, April 15th      2015 Conference Preview   Cindy Tsui (CAS \u201915) majoring in Computer Science, Pre-Med Long-Term Durability and Dose Escalation Patterns in Infliximab Therapy for Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease affecting 3% of the population. The prevailing reason for discontinuation of infliximab treatment for psoriasis is loss of clinical response, requiring dose intensification to optimize the treatment regimen. Furthermore, concomitant immunosuppressive medications, e.g. methotrexate, theoretically extend infliximab durability. Our research shows infliximab dose escalation to be well tolerated in our patient cohort and confirms that concurrent methotrexate is associated with significantly improved maintenance of clinical response. Our experience with intensified infliximab regimens supports the efficacy and safety of dose escalation in treating psoriasis.
