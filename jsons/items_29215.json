We wish to create a space of dialogue and discussion around matters concerning modern and contemporary Latin American art. Most of our events will take place in the seminar room of the IFA (although at times we will sponsor events elsewhere in the University). The idea is to have a smaller-than-usual venue for more intense conversation and to distribute either the papers or a pr\u00e9cis of the talk to the audience beforehand so that guests will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the subject and formulate questions and comments.    This forum is generously funded by the Institute of Studies on Latin American Art (ISLAA). For more information on ISLAA, click here .

We wish to create a space of dialogue and discussion around matters concerning modern and contemporary Latin American art. Most of our events will take place in the seminar room of the IFA (although at times we will sponsor events elsewhere in the University). The idea is to have a smaller-than-usual venue for more intense conversation and to distribute either the papers or a pr\u00e9cis of the talk to the audience beforehand so that guests will have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with the subject and formulate questions and comments.    This forum is generously funded by the Institute of Studies on Latin American Art (ISLAA). For more information on ISLAA, click here .

The series is coordinated by Professors Jonathan Brown, Robert Lubar, and Edward Sullivan.    The Colloquium is now over 15 years old and it continues to enhance the considerable strength of the IFA in the areas of Latin American and Spanish art. We have tried this year to have a strong across-the-board presence of scholars from a variety of fields in the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Americas. In addition, with the first lecture on art and society in Victorian Jamaica by Professor Timothy Barringer of Yale, we are including other aspects of the hemisphere--something which is only appropriate given the current interest in the Caribbean. Several of our scholar-speakers are graduates of the IFA: Michele Greet and Adele Nelson did their PhD degrees in modern Latin American art and Ronda Kasl studied early modern Spain. Richard Kagan of Johns Hopkins has developed a strong sub-speciality in the history of reception of Spanish art in the US and Professor Robert Davidson from Toronto will examine questions of social and artistic interest related to the Cuban revolution. This group of stellar art and social historians will certainly add immensely to our deeper understanding of the broadly-described field of Hispanic Studies.   We gratefully acknowledge the continuing support of Roberta and Richard Huber for making the 2013-2014 Colloquium possible.    2015       Thursday, April 30, 2015, 6:00 PM     Irene Small ,\u00a0 Assistant Professor , Princeton University     Poor Image and Meta-Medium: H\u00e9rcules Florence and the Invention of Photography in Brazil     Please note this lecture has been cancelled.
