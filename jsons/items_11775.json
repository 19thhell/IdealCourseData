In some ICUs the students are taught directly by faculty performing service responsibilities (ICU Attending) and in others, there are dedicated Student Teaching Attendings. Students also attend lectures, workshops and simulations to help deliver curriculum content.   ICU and CCU Student Teaching Attending   Goal:  To teach medical students to care for critically ill patients.   Role:  You will meet a group of students in an ICU setting three times a week for four weeks. You will assess each student\u2019s ability to elicit a history, perform a physical examination, interpret laboratory and radiographic tests, present the information in a cohesive manner, synthesize all the information into a diagnosis, and provide general goals of care while in the ICU. This role includes modeling professional behavior, observing the student perform elements of the history and physical examination, reviewing the underlying pathophysiology with the student, and providing up to date treatment options. The role also includes giving feedback to students and submitting student evaluations at the midpoint and upon completion of clerkship.   Faculty Commitment:  This role requires 24 hours of direct student teaching over the four week block. There is an additional 24 hours of preparatory time and administrative time required for this role.   Interested Faculty should contact Dr. Norma Keller , the Clerkship Director.   ICU and CCU Teaching Attending   Goal:  To oversee the delivery of ICU level care to patients while simultaneously training fellows, residents and students.   Role:  As you normally round with the ICU team, you will teach the entire team how to care for the critically ill patient. This role includes allowing students to present cases during rounds and observing them while they examine patients. Faculty should provide feedback to students at least once near the midway point of the clerkship. Also, ICU Teaching Attendings evaluate students using the online evaluation system.   Faculty Commitment:  This role includes the education of three types of learners. On average, ICU teams round for 24 hours per week which translates into an average time commitment of 96 hours per four week block. Additionally there is an additional 24 hours of administrative and preparatory time required to perform this role.   This role is combined with service responsibility in one of the ICU\u2019s at NYU\u2019s core teaching facilities.   Simulation Instructor   Goal:  To facilitate a simulation scenario for a group of students.   Role:  You will facilitate simulation scenarios with a group of 5 students that demonstrates important aspects of critical care medicine (i.e. the recognition and treatment of severe sepsis) as well as leadership and team building exercises. You will teach airway management principles and demonstrate proper aoirway management techniques and intubation. You will observe each student perform these activities and provide feedback.   Faculty Commitment:  Each simulation requires three hours of teaching time plus four hours of preparatory time.   Interested Faculty should contact Dr. Norma Keller, the Clerkship Director.   Lecturer:  The goal is to deliver curriculum content to groups of students taking the clerkship.   Each lecture represents 1.5 hours of teaching time plus three hours of preparatory time.   Interested Faculty should contact Dr. Norma Keller , the Clerkship Director.   Workshop Leader   Goal:  Familiarize students with principles of acid-base, respiratory physiology and ventilation management.   Role:  Present material in an interactive format with hands on demonstration of different ventilator modes.
