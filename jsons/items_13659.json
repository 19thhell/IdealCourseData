Opportunity   In 2010, NYU welcomed the single most historically diverse class onto the NYU Abu Dhabi campus. How do you connect an incoming class from 39 different countries with different value systems and backgrounds before they even set foot on campus? You get them talking. And that\u2019s exactly what the Summer Colloquium did. By taking the idea of summer reading to a new level, the incoming freshman class started sharing ideas and information in a virtual summer reading colloquium focused on cosmopolitanism.   Meeting the Need   But how do you go about engaging a group of people virtually in a meaningful way? We designed the colloquium to interface through multiple mediums: seeing, writing and discussing, and listening. Built on a wiki platform, the program linked to Blackboard, iTunes U, Second Life, and Academic Gallery. After reading the book of choice, Kwame Anthony Appiah's &quot;Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers,&quot; students were able to form chat groups and discussion feeds, respond to relevant and stirring prompts, listen to previous lectures on cosmopolitanism, and even form a digital art show curated in response to the topics at hand.   The wiki provided a place to make pre-departure announcements, updates, and answer frequently asked questions, as well as provide links to NYUAD social networking sites and blogs. NYU\u2019s learning management system at the time, Blackboard, provided a chat tool. Students were divided into small groups of four to start discussing questions in the syllabus and learn the disparate viewpoints of their classmates. Groups were then asked to provide questions in response. Professor Matthew Silverstein hosted large chat groups to discuss these response questions. Out of these large chat groups, questions were sent to NYUAD Associated Dean of Humanities Cyrus Patell, who used them to prepare a final lecture. Students could then listen to this and other lectures on cosmopolitanism before joining each other in Abu Dhabi.   One of the students\u2019 first assignments, after reading the book, was to take a picture in their local community that represented cosmopolitanism. They uploaded the pictures to Blackboard anonymously and an administrator uploaded them to Academic Gallery. The photos debuted both physically and virtually. Liam Fry, manager of ITS constructed a virtual second life reproduction of 19 Washington Square North to \u201chang\u201d the student pictures, and Kerry Barrett used this virtual space as a diagram for planning the physical exhibition.     The colloquium focused on discussing ideas and theories via multiple mediums and from multiple perspectives, whether they be sociological, political or humanistic. Students not only learned to understand each other\u2019s perspectives and form relationships but also prepared for life in a multicultural and interdisciplinary program. All activities came to a head at welcome week when Cyrus Patell delivered a welcome speech incorporating topics that had been in discussion all summer.   Making It Work   How did we get here?   The philosophy behind the colloquium harkens back to the university leadership\u2019s Global Network University vision. Members of the administration selected a book for the course that focused on the concept of cosmopolitanism within the network and within the world. Due to a multi-faceted and layered virtual presence, we relied heavily on the tremendous support of several ITS groups to bring this colloquium to reality--creating a program that was complex and layered in a way that reflects the student body. There was also a sense of involving people who spoke meaningfully to the program topics. Carol Brandt, assistant vice provost for global education, heading off admissions for AD, saw the need for a summer program that was more involved than the typical summer reading program. While professor Mattie Silverstein could speak to the philosophical ideas behind cosmopolitanism, and Cyrus Patell brought an extensive amount of his own knowledge and writing on cosmopolitanism. And of course the students are the keystone of this experience, bringing their rich backgrounds and enthusiastic participation.   So where are we headed?   For colloquiums in the future we\u2019ll be working to promote even more interaction. We\u2019ve considered moving away from the wiki platform to allow more virtual interaction such as friending or live chats. We are a group and a university in constant evolution.

Opportunity   In 2010, NYU welcomed the single most historically diverse class onto the NYU Abu Dhabi campus. How do you connect an incoming class from 39 different countries with different value systems and backgrounds before they even set foot on campus? You get them talking. And that\u2019s exactly what the Summer Colloquium did. By taking the idea of summer reading to a new level, the incoming freshman class started sharing ideas and information in a virtual summer reading colloquium focused on cosmopolitanism.   Meeting the Need   But how do you go about engaging a group of people virtually in a meaningful way? We designed the colloquium to interface through multiple mediums: seeing, writing and discussing, and listening. Built on a wiki platform, the program linked to Blackboard, iTunes U, Second Life, and Academic Gallery. After reading the book of choice, Kwame Anthony Appiah's &quot;Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers,&quot; students were able to form chat groups and discussion feeds, respond to relevant and stirring prompts, listen to previous lectures on cosmopolitanism, and even form a digital art show curated in response to the topics at hand.   The wiki provided a place to make pre-departure announcements, updates, and answer frequently asked questions, as well as provide links to NYUAD social networking sites and blogs. NYU\u2019s learning management system at the time, Blackboard, provided a chat tool. Students were divided into small groups of four to start discussing questions in the syllabus and learn the disparate viewpoints of their classmates. Groups were then asked to provide questions in response. Professor Matthew Silverstein hosted large chat groups to discuss these response questions. Out of these large chat groups, questions were sent to NYUAD Associated Dean of Humanities Cyrus Patell, who used them to prepare a final lecture. Students could then listen to this and other lectures on cosmopolitanism before joining each other in Abu Dhabi.   One of the students\u2019 first assignments, after reading the book, was to take a picture in their local community that represented cosmopolitanism. They uploaded the pictures to Blackboard anonymously and an administrator uploaded them to Academic Gallery. The photos debuted both physically and virtually. Liam Fry, manager of ITS constructed a virtual second life reproduction of 19 Washington Square North to \u201chang\u201d the student pictures, and Kerry Barrett used this virtual space as a diagram for planning the physical exhibition.     The colloquium focused on discussing ideas and theories via multiple mediums and from multiple perspectives, whether they be sociological, political or humanistic. Students not only learned to understand each other\u2019s perspectives and form relationships but also prepared for life in a multicultural and interdisciplinary program. All activities came to a head at welcome week when Cyrus Patell delivered a welcome speech incorporating topics that had been in discussion all summer.   Making It Work   How did we get here?   The philosophy behind the colloquium harkens back to the university leadership\u2019s Global Network University vision. Members of the administration selected a book for the course that focused on the concept of cosmopolitanism within the network and within the world. Due to a multi-faceted and layered virtual presence, we relied heavily on the tremendous support of several ITS groups to bring this colloquium to reality--creating a program that was complex and layered in a way that reflects the student body. There was also a sense of involving people who spoke meaningfully to the program topics. Carol Brandt, assistant vice provost for global education, heading off admissions for AD, saw the need for a summer program that was more involved than the typical summer reading program. While professor Mattie Silverstein could speak to the philosophical ideas behind cosmopolitanism, and Cyrus Patell brought an extensive amount of his own knowledge and writing on cosmopolitanism. And of course the students are the keystone of this experience, bringing their rich backgrounds and enthusiastic participation.   So where are we headed?   For colloquiums in the future we\u2019ll be working to promote even more interaction. We\u2019ve considered moving away from the wiki platform to allow more virtual interaction such as friending or live chats. We are a group and a university in constant evolution.

Ancient to modern writers have been fascinated with the power of art, and for each, ideas about art are connected to those about language and society. In our reading of\u00a0 Ion \u00a0and\u00a0 Gorgias \u00a0we will look at Plato's ideas on art, rhetoric (oratory), and power before his\u00a0 Republic \u00a0.\u00a0 Phaedrus \u00a0, written later, complements the discussion in earlier texts, developing Plato's ideas about the relation of the intellect, the emotions, and the appetites. We may also read Plato's\u00a0 Symposium \u00a0to consider, as Tina Turner says, what love has to do with it. We will then discuss Diderot's\u00a0 Rameau's Nephew \u00a0, which revisits some of Plato's themes from the perspective of the eighteenth century and the changing world of the Enlightenment. Finally, we will explore the dialogue form in the twentieth century through one modern novel, Virginia Woolf's\u00a0 Between the Acts \u00a0and Tom Stoppard's play\u00a0 Arcadia \u00a0. In our dialogue, we will explore not only at what these writers say, but how they say it, and speculate on how and why conversation, rather than monologue, can give rise to knowledge. Among the questions I hope we consider are the following: How are ideas born from conversation (and, I hope, our conversations)? What is the importance of human relationship in intellectual inquiry? How does the dialogue imply, and necessitate, our participation as readers? Readings may include works by Plato, Diderot, Stoppard, and Woolf.
