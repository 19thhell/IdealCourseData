It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq. FREN-UA 991.002 La Politique des Images en France Prof. Ludovic Cortade TR, 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm 194 Mercer, 208 #6884 Ce s\u00e9minaire, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants \u00abSenior\u00bb, offre une m\u00e9thode pour comprendre l\u2019importance et l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence des images dans notre civilisation, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, en France. Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.  FREN-UA 965 (conducted in French ) Topics in French Literature: Slavery in the Francophone World Prof. C\u00e9cile Bishop MW, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-19 #8726 Between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century, France was responsible for the kidnapping, forced transport and brutal enslavement of over a million Africans. This course examines representations of slavery in a wide range of media including literature, film and visual arts, from the late 18th century to the present day. In addition to exploring the role of slavery in shaping French and francophone cultures, students will develop new perspectives on the power and limits of literature and art in representing violence and suffering. Authors studied include Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Claire de Duras, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Maryse Cond\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 Schwarz-Bart and Patrick Chamoiseau.

Adopting a chronological approach, we will explore the different stages of Paris\u2019 development through the analysis of numerous historical and literary texts, maps, paintings, photographs and movies. In the process, we will journey through over 2000 years of French history, discovering major political, social and artistic events, and developing a vision of the organic growth of the city.

One film is viewed per week and   analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and   poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media   and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these   media so often focus.

FREN-UA 145 Approaches to Francophone Literature Prof. St\u00e9phane Gerson TR, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-4 #8249 The course examines the conceptualizing of Francophonie through the literature from a network of French-speaking countries which together form a Francophone space. It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq. FREN-UA 991.002 La Politique des Images en France Prof. Ludovic Cortade TR, 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm 194 Mercer, 208 #6884 Ce s\u00e9minaire, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants \u00abSenior\u00bb, offre une m\u00e9thode pour comprendre l\u2019importance et l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence des images dans notre civilisation, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, en France. Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

L'analyse portera tant sur les th\u00e8mes et les personnages que sur l'organisation du texte et les probl\u00e8mes de la narration, le point du vue, l'expression du temps et de l'espace, sans oublier une certaine forme de recontextualisation historique.  FREN-UA 965 (conducted in French ) Topics in French Literature: Slavery in the Francophone World Prof. C\u00e9cile Bishop MW, 3:30pm \u2013 4:45pm 25 W. 4th St., C-19 #8726 Between the seventeenth and the nineteenth century, France was responsible for the kidnapping, forced transport and brutal enslavement of over a million Africans. This course examines representations of slavery in a wide range of media including literature, film and visual arts, from the late 18th century to the present day. In addition to exploring the role of slavery in shaping French and francophone cultures, students will develop new perspectives on the power and limits of literature and art in representing violence and suffering. Authors studied include Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Claire de Duras, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Maryse Cond\u00e9, Andr\u00e9 Schwarz-Bart and Patrick Chamoiseau.

Adopting a chronological approach, we will explore the different stages of Paris\u2019 development through the analysis of numerous historical and literary texts, maps, paintings, photographs and movies. In the process, we will journey through over 2000 years of French history, discovering major political, social and artistic events, and developing a vision of the organic growth of the city.

One film is viewed per week and   analyzed with reading assignments that include novels, plays, and   poems. The objective is to exploit the potentiality of different media   and to make vivid and intellectual the climate of Europe on which these   media so often focus.

It not only addresses the colonial past but the anti-colonial and postcolonial situations in which French colonialism is replaced by more complex relationships and ideologies. One of the most difficult issues that confronts the postcolonial francophone world is the question of cultural homogeneity and social integration within national structures. This course focuses on the problematic area of cultural transformation, language contact and the role of the writer in elaborating a post-colonial national identity. The problematizing of language, nation and writing will be examined in both a theoretical way and in the prose fiction of Maryse Conde of Guadeloupe, Jacques Roumain of Haiti, Sembene Ousmane of Senegal and Assia Djebar of Algeria.

FREN-UA 991.001 Esp\u00e8ces d'espaces Prof. Phillip John Usher MW, 11:00am \u2013 12:15pm 25 W. 4th St., C-18 #6883 Le titre de ce cours est emprunt\u00e9 \u00e0 un livre de Georges P\u00e9rec, publi\u00e9 en 1974, qui s\u2019interroge sur le sens des \u00ab lieux \u00bb dans lesquels nous vivons (le lit, la chambre, l\u2019appartement, l\u2019immeuble, la rue, le quartier, la ville, etc.). P\u00e9rec d\u00e9montre combien ces lieux que nous fr\u00e9quentons, comme inconsciemment, sont aussi lisibles qu\u2019un livre, combien ces lieux poss\u00e8dent une logique et une syntaxe, combien ces lieux sont des \u00ab fictions \u00bb autant que des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Embo\u00eetant le pas \u00e0 P\u00e9rec (que nous lirons) et nous inspirant \u00e9galement de certains autres penseurs du XXe si\u00e8cle (Foucault, Certeau, Aug\u00e9, Latour, etc.), nous voudrions donc r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la litt\u00e9rature probl\u00e9matise notre relation aux \u00ab lieux \u00bb, des plus intimes (le lit) aux plus abstraits (l\u2019univers, l\u2019 \u00ab anthropoc\u00e8ne \u00bb). En privil\u00e9giant ces questions, nous pr\u00e9l\u00e8verons sur l\u2019histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise des \u0153uvres publi\u00e9es depuis le Moyen \u00c2ge jusqu\u2019au XXIe si\u00e8cle. Auteurs probables (liste pr\u00e9liminaire) : Marie de France, Christine de Pisan, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Joachim du Bellay, Gilles Corrozet, Raymond Queneau, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Michel Butor, Michel Foucault, Georges P\u00e9rec, Monique Wittig, Annie Ernaux, Michel Houellebecq. FREN-UA 991.002 La Politique des Images en France Prof. Ludovic Cortade TR, 12:30pm \u2013 1:45pm 194 Mercer, 208 #6884 Ce s\u00e9minaire, sp\u00e9cialement destin\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants \u00abSenior\u00bb, offre une m\u00e9thode pour comprendre l\u2019importance et l\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence des images dans notre civilisation, et plus particuli\u00e8rement, en France. Nous essaierons de comprendre les enjeux politiques des images, leur dimension id\u00e9ologique et l\u2019influence qu\u2019elles exercent sur notre vie quotidienne. Les discussions et les expos\u00e9s ont pour objectif d\u2019offrir aux \u00e9tudiants de larges opportunit\u00e9s de s\u2019exprimer et de se situer en tant que citoyens libres de leurs opinions. Th\u00e8mes et questions abord\u00e9s dans ce cours inclurent: L\u2019iconographie des hommes politiques, les rapports entre la politique et l\u2019humour au cin\u00e9ma, l\u2019influence des images sur la perception du corps, de la sexualit\u00e9 et du genre, la publicit\u00e9 et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de consommation, la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019environnement, et la question de la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et de la censure.

Graduate Courses  Open to Undergraduates      Courses in the Graduate  School of Arts and Science are open to seniors with a 3.5 average in  three 4-point courses (12 points) of advanced work in French. If  these courses are offered toward the requirements for the  baccalaureate degree, no advanced credit is allowed for them in the  graduate school. Before registering for these courses, students must  obtain the permission of the director of undergraduate studies.      A complete list of  graduate courses open to qualified seniors is available in the  department each semester.

What if you were able to learn more about  these people directly from what they say and write instead of depending upon  someone else\u2019s interpretation? What if  you could gain further access to the linguistic and cultural production of  these nearly quarter-of-a-billion people to deepen your understanding of the  world and all it has to offer? Now you  can\u2026.welcome back to French!                         Materials:   Horizons (5 th edition)             i. Textbook             ii. On-line access to iLrn          Course and  Materials Description: This Elementary French II course is designed  to provide students who have already studied one semester of French (or the  equivalent thereof) with the remainder of the fundamentals of the French  language, a language spoken by hundreds of millions of people scattered  throughout every continent around the globe. The tool that we will use to explore this  language and the numerous cultures for which it is a vehicle is \u201cHorizons,\u201d a  year-long, multi-component beginning French program that includes a textbook  and, housed on-line at the iLrn site, a workbook/lab manual, an eBook, a video  library, a battery of diagnostic tests, a companion website, and more. All the components are fully integrated, so  you should familiarize yourself with the structure of the program and all of  its parts before you embark on your linguistic adventure this semester.      You  will see that each chapter in your textbook is divided into \u201cCompt\u00e9tences,\u201d and  for each \u201cComp\u00e9tence\u201d there are explicit communicative goals (e.g., talking  about what you like to do, asking for information, paying a bill, etc.). The grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary  presented and discussed in the \u201cComp\u00e9tence\u201d sections will help you achieve  these goals. To be sure that by the end  of a chapter you\u2019ve learned how to do what you set out to do at the beginning  of the chapter, you can do the exercises in the \u201cReprise\u201d section located at  the end of every chapter. If you find  that you are still not sure about certain grammar points, you can consult the  \u201cR\u00e9sum\u00e9 de grammaire,\u201d also located at the end of every chapter. The on-line workbook/lab manual (discussed in  detail below) will provide you with further opportunities to verify your  progress.      On  a final note, keep in mind that learning a language is learning to do something  (e.g., speak, read, write, and listen), not learning about something. Successfully learning to do something  requires regular practice, not last minute, frantic study. You couldn\u2019t become a good basketball player  by reading about basketball every so often, then reading a whole lot the night  before a game, and then stepping out onto the court for the first time the day  of the game. The same holds true for  language. To do well, you need to  practice every day; you need to train your mouth and your mind to speak and  think differently. That can\u2019t be done in  one all-night cram session!          Grading:   Written  Tests (3)   45%            Oral Test      10%            Oral Presentation   10%            Homework     15%            Essays (5)      10%            Participation     10%          Tests: Tests  should not be solely an indication of the average of where you have been during  the semester; they should also reflect the level of skill and knowledge you\u2019ve  achieved by the end of the course. As a  result, your three tests during the semester, all of which are cumulative, are  unevenly weighted. The first test is 10%  of your final grade, the second test is 15% of your final grade, and the third  test is 20% of your final grade. Not  only is this a more logical distribution of points, since you should know a lot  more by the end of the semester, but it also benefits those of you who are new  to language study and might need a little more time before everything \u201cclicks.\u201d      You  will take your written tests in class on the days indicated on this  syllabus. Be sure you arrive a little  early on test days because each test begins with an oral comprehension  section. If you arrive late, you will  miss the reading necessary for the completion of that first section. No  late written tests will be administered.      The  oral test (administered at the end of the semester) takes place in your  teacher\u2019s office. The oral diagnostic  (administered in the middle of the semester) also takes place in your teacher\u2019s  office; however, while written feedback will be provided for the oral  diagnostic, the oral diagnostic itself is not graded. The oral diagnostic is simply a chance for  you to practice taking an oral exam. No late oral diagnostics or oral tests will  be administered.          Oral Presentation: At the  end of the semester you and a partner will give a five to six minute oral  presentation on a francophone region (e.g., Louisiana, French Guyana, New York!),  personality (e.g., Marie Antoinette, Tanya St-Val), event (la Guerre d\u2019Alg\u00e9rie,  the passage of the Charte de la langue fran\u00e7aise), etc. You can find information for your  presentation in the library, on line, or from interviews with French speakers,  but be sure when you give your presentation in class that your words are your  own. If you cite a source, no matter  what it is, make it very clear that you are citing someone else\u2019s words. You are not allowed to use an Internet  translation device to prepare your presentation, nor can you have a  French-speaking friend or family member proofread your work. No  late oral presentations will be permitted.           Homework: Your homework grade is not  based on how many of your homework answers are correct, but rather on how much  effort you put into doing the work.   Mistakes are an essential part of learning anything new, including a new  language\u2026there is a reason why people say, \u201cYou learn from your mistakes.\u201d You should think of your homework assignments  as an opportunity to try to see how well you know what you\u2019ve been studying and  to pinpoint areas that you still need to work on.      The  on-line workbook/lab manual (housed at the iLrn site) contains an array of  well-designed exercises divided into two sections: \u201cactivit\u00e9s \u00e9crites,\u201d or  written activities, and \u201cactivit\u00e9s orales,\u201d or speaking activities. These exercises focus on listening, speaking,  pronunciation, grammar, writing, reading, and culture. For each \u201cComp\u00e9tence\u201d section, you need to complete  the assigned activities (both \u201c\u00e9crites\u201d and \u201corales\u201d) by the day indicated on  line. Each set of workbook/lab manual  exercises for a given \u201cComp\u00e9tence\u201d section is due the day the following \u201cComp\u00e9tence\u201d  section is to be begun. For example, if  you go to the on-line workbook/lab manual, you will see that the assigned  written and oral exercises corresponding to \u201cChapter 1, Comp\u00e9tence 1\u201d are due  on September 22 nd , the day on which you begin discussing \u201cChapter 1,  Comp\u00e9tences 2 and 3.\u201d      You  will notice that some of the exercises you do can be corrected with the click  of a mouse, while others will require your teacher\u2019s input. You are, of course, welcome to do additional  exercises that are not marked as assigned, and additional exercises from the  on-line workbook/lab manual may be assigned by your teacher for homework. No  late homework will be accepted for credit.      Note  that while there are workbook exercises due every week, you never have very  many written exercises to complete at one time.   The workbook assignment schedule has been designed in this way to help  you achieve your goal (or rather, what we hope is your goal!) to work on your  French in a regular manner. Don\u2019t do the  exercises assigned the night before (or the morning!) they are due. That vastly diminishes your chances of  learning something from them. Instead,  do two or three exercises each night.   This is an easy way to check yourself and to make sure you have a good  handle on the vocabulary, culture, and grammar being presented and discussed in  class.          Essays: You will write four essays  during the course of the semester. These  essays are due in class on the days indicated on the syllabus.      As  you may know by now, the best way to improve your writing skills in any  language is to take a process approach to writing, which is what we will do in  this class. When you turn in an essay,  your teacher will read it and signal the errors; however, he or she will not  provide you with the correct forms. When  you get your essay back, you will then need to look over your teacher\u2019s  comments and rewrite the essay, correcting the errors your teacher indicated  and incorporating all the changes your teacher suggested. Your final grade for an essay will be the  average of your first grade and the grade for your rewrite. Not  rewriting your essay will result in a 0 (zero) as the final essay grade.      The  essay assignments are a chance for you to find out just what you can really do  in written French. The essays you submit  should be entirely your own work so that you can know for sure where your  strengths and weaknesses lie. You may  not ask a French-speaking friend, family member, or acquaintance to read over  and correct your essay before you turn it in \u2013 not only will you lose out on  the chance to show yourself and your teacher what you can do, but this is at  best a form of cheating, at worst plagiarism.   In addition, you may not use Internet translation programs such as Babblefish  when writing your essay. This, too, is  plagiarism. If you do decide to use a  friend or family member\u2019s help or an Internet translation program, even if it  is for only part of your essay, you will receive a 0 (zero) for your essay. Make everyone happy and get the most out of  your work by doing it all yourself!      You  are encouraged to use good, large dictionaries (both French-English and  French-French) while composing your essays.   Small paperback dictionaries, while often very handy in class, are  unreliable sources for this kind of written assignment. Don\u2019t forget that through the Bobst homepage  you have free access to the on-line Oxford-Hachette bilingual French-English  dictionary.      The essay topics are listed in the schedule at the end of this  syllabus. No late essays or essay rewrites will be accepted.          Participation: As you  can imagine, participation is of the utmost importance in a language  class. Your participation grade does not  depend simply on your being physically present in class. A good participation grade depends on having  all your assignments completed before class, participating (in French!) to the  best of your ability, and making a real effort to improve.      Since  participation, or \u201ctime-on-task\u201d as it is sometimes called, is so important to  your regular progress, it counts as part of your grade. Keep in mind that when you are not in class,  no matter what the reason, you are missing essential time spent in French. This has a negative impact on your progress  and the participation component of your grade.    It\u2019s very simple: there are no excused or unexcused absences,  there are just absences. Once you miss  four classes, you will receive a warning letter, a copy of which will also be  sent to the Director of Language Programs.   For every absence over four, one percentage point will be deducted from  your final grade (in addition to any points you may have lost from the  participation component of your grade).         If you find that a serious illness  or family emergency will cause you to miss many more classes than are allowed,  you should speak with your instructor or academic counselor about the  possibility of arranging for a withdrawal from the class.
