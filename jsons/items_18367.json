Check out the online preview, available on the housing portal .     Phase 2: Room Selection is the process by which students are given the opportunity to select a room online from the available housing inventory. Selection times are determined randomly within priority groups. Students submitting names together (for room, suite or hall placement) will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   The Phase 2 Room Selection will take place between March 30, 2015 and April 3, 2015.   Due to the high demand for NYU Housing, not all students may be able to select a space during the Phase 2: Room Selection. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services will administratively assign students who are unable to select their room over the summer. In this situation, students are still committed to the full terms of the housing license as outlined in the key components of the process . Students should re-review the 2015-2016 proposed housing rates prior to the start of Phase 2.     The Room Selection step can only be accessed through the housing application portal on your NYUHome account. There you will find the &quot;Housing Forms Log-In&quot; channel on the NYU Life page. Click on the &quot;Student Housing and Meal Plan Forms&quot; link and follow the University login prompts to access the application portal. Once in the portal, you may access the housing re-application by clicking the &quot;Application&quot; link in the grey navigation bar. You will want to select the &quot;Academic Year 2015-2016&quot; application. Once in the application, you will be able to readily access Phase 2.         RESIDENCE HALL AVAILABILITY   (Hall availability is subject to change.)

Please make note the special interest programs in the following buildings.     Broome Street will house the Residential College program.   Seventh Street will house the Green House program.   West 13th Street will house the Senior House Program            SELECTION TIME NOTIFICATION   Room Selection times are determined by a randomized sorting within priority categories. Students who have registered in a group will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   Students will be notified by 5pm on March 27, 2015 (date subject to change) via their NYUHome account of the specific date and time that they will be able to access the Room Selection step, view the available inventory, and select a room. Students will be able to access the Room Selection step through the Housing Forms Channel at NYUHome .   While students are not required to choose an assignment at their selection time, other students will continue to be rolled into the selection pool, making it likely that there will be fewer spaces as the process continues. The process will be open through 5:00pm EST on April 3, 2015, as space permits, for students to make a room selection for next year.       SELECTION TIMES     The selection times are randomly generated based on students\u2019 individual priority or averaged group priority (if a student has registered with a group in Phase 1).   Students participating in Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, the Senior House, or the Residential College will only be able to select within the program to which they were accepted.   Students participating in the Residential College will begin selecting on Monday, March 30, 2015 (date subject to change) .   The general student room selection process (including Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, and the Senior House) will begin on Tuesday, March 31, 2015 (date subject to change) .   Once selection times are determined, timetables will be provided to give students a better idea about where their selection time falls within the overall process.

When you access the Phase 2 step, you will be able to browse through the available inventory and select a room. Once your room has been confirmed, it cannot be changed. Be sure to make your selection carefully. Students can access the Phase 2: Room Selection step in the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     SELECTING AS A GROUP   All individuals within a group can log in and select independently OR allow the Group Leader to select for them. Only the Group Leader can select for other group members. The Group Leader may only select spaces for group members within the same suite or floor.   As space becomes limited, groups may be forced to split apart. If possible, all group members are encouraged to be together to assist the Group Leader with selection decisions. It is critical that group members discuss options and alternatives. Once an assignment is confirmed, it cannot be changed.   If the Group Leader does not assign all members of the group, the unassigned members are responsible for individually assigning themselves anytime after their group selection time but prior to April 3, 2015. Students can access the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     CONSOLIDATION POLICY   In an effort to create more housing options for incoming and existing residents, ensure equity, and maximize use of available space, the University will actively seek to consolidate vacancies within the University Housing system. Students that are assigned to partially vacant rooms may be reassigned. This means that the hall, room, and/or roommates you select now may be changed if necessary for consolidation purposes. Consolidation may occur prior to check-in or during the academic year and students may be reassigned to other rooms, floors, or residence halls where necessary.       POST SELECTION ROOM CHANGE PROCESS   Students who are dissatisfied with their room selection may submit a Post Selection Room Change Request. Students must select a space in Phase 2 in order to be considered in the Post Selection Room Change process. The online room change form will be available on March 30, 2015 through May 15, 2015.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.

Check out the online preview, available on the housing portal .     Phase 2: Room Selection is the process by which students are given the opportunity to select a room online from the available housing inventory. Selection times are determined randomly within priority groups. Students submitting names together (for room, suite or hall placement) will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   The Phase 2 Room Selection will take place between March 30, 2015 and April 3, 2015.   Due to the high demand for NYU Housing, not all students may be able to select a space during the Phase 2: Room Selection. The Office of Residential Life and Housing Services will administratively assign students who are unable to select their room over the summer. In this situation, students are still committed to the full terms of the housing license as outlined in the key components of the process . Students should re-review the 2015-2016 proposed housing rates prior to the start of Phase 2.     The Room Selection step can only be accessed through the housing application portal on your NYUHome account. There you will find the &quot;Housing Forms Log-In&quot; channel on the NYU Life page. Click on the &quot;Student Housing and Meal Plan Forms&quot; link and follow the University login prompts to access the application portal. Once in the portal, you may access the housing re-application by clicking the &quot;Application&quot; link in the grey navigation bar. You will want to select the &quot;Academic Year 2015-2016&quot; application. Once in the application, you will be able to readily access Phase 2.         RESIDENCE HALL AVAILABILITY   (Hall availability is subject to change.)        Brooklyn Halls   Clark Hall  Othmer Hall (limited availability)      Manhattan Halls   Alumni Hall  Broome Street Coral Tower  Carlyle Court (towers 2 &amp; 3) Gramercy Green Greenwich Hall  Lafayette Street Palladium Hall Second Street  Seventh Street West 13th Street University Hall (limited availability)  Fall Only:     Affina Manhattan Carlyle (tower 1)       Most buildings will have a number of spaces withheld from general room selection for pre-designated Explorations and Special Interest Programs.   Please make note the special interest programs in the following buildings.     Broome Street will house the Residential College program.   Seventh Street will house the Green House program.   West 13th Street will house the Senior House Program            SELECTION TIME NOTIFICATION   Room Selection times are determined by a randomized sorting within priority categories. Students who have registered in a group will have individual priorities averaged to create one group priority.   Students will be notified by 5pm on March 27, 2015 (date subject to change) via their NYUHome account of the specific date and time that they will be able to access the Room Selection step, view the available inventory, and select a room. Students will be able to access the Room Selection step through the Housing Forms Channel at NYUHome .   While students are not required to choose an assignment at their selection time, other students will continue to be rolled into the selection pool, making it likely that there will be fewer spaces as the process continues. The process will be open through 5:00pm EST on April 3, 2015, as space permits, for students to make a room selection for next year.       SELECTION TIMES     The selection times are randomly generated based on students\u2019 individual priority or averaged group priority (if a student has registered with a group in Phase 1).   Students participating in Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, the Senior House, or the Residential College will only be able to select within the program to which they were accepted.   Students participating in the Residential College will begin selecting on Monday, March 30, 2015 (date subject to change) .   The general student room selection process (including Explorations programs, the Green House, the International House, and the Senior House) will begin on Tuesday, March 31, 2015 (date subject to change) .   Once selection times are determined, timetables will be provided to give students a better idea about where their selection time falls within the overall process.

When you access the Phase 2 step, you will be able to browse through the available inventory and select a room. Once your room has been confirmed, it cannot be changed. Be sure to make your selection carefully. Students can access the Phase 2: Room Selection step in the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     SELECTING AS A GROUP   All individuals within a group can log in and select independently OR allow the Group Leader to select for them. Only the Group Leader can select for other group members. The Group Leader may only select spaces for group members within the same suite or floor.   As space becomes limited, groups may be forced to split apart. If possible, all group members are encouraged to be together to assist the Group Leader with selection decisions. It is critical that group members discuss options and alternatives. Once an assignment is confirmed, it cannot be changed.   If the Group Leader does not assign all members of the group, the unassigned members are responsible for individually assigning themselves anytime after their group selection time but prior to April 3, 2015. Students can access the Academic Year 2015-2016 application via the Housing Forms channel at NYUHome .     CONSOLIDATION POLICY   In an effort to create more housing options for incoming and existing residents, ensure equity, and maximize use of available space, the University will actively seek to consolidate vacancies within the University Housing system. Students that are assigned to partially vacant rooms may be reassigned. This means that the hall, room, and/or roommates you select now may be changed if necessary for consolidation purposes. Consolidation may occur prior to check-in or during the academic year and students may be reassigned to other rooms, floors, or residence halls where necessary.       POST SELECTION ROOM CHANGE PROCESS   Students who are dissatisfied with their room selection may submit a Post Selection Room Change Request. Students must select a space in Phase 2 in order to be considered in the Post Selection Room Change process. The online room change form will be available on March 30, 2015 through May 15, 2015.                          Important Updates   Room selection for 2015-2016 is now closed.

Overview   The NYU-Depth V2 data set is comprised of video sequences from a variety of indoor scenes as recorded by both the RGB and Depth cameras from the Microsoft Kinect . It features:      1449 densely labeled pairs of aligned RGB and depth images   464 new scenes taken from 3 cities   407,024 new unlabeled frames   Each object is labeled with a class and an instance number (cup1, cup2, cup3, etc)      The dataset has several components:     Labeled: A subset of the video data accompanied by dense multi-class labels. This data has also been preprocessed to fill in missing depth labels.   Raw: The raw rgb, depth and accelerometer data as provided by the Kinect.   Toolbox: Useful functions for manipulating the data and labels.      Downloads        Labeled dataset (~2.8 GB)        Raw dataset, Single File (~428 GB)        Raw dataset, Multi-part (~428 GB)        Toolbox        Labeled Dataset       Output from the RGB camera (left), preprocessed depth (center) and a set of labels (right) for the image.   The labeled dataset is a subset of the Raw Dataset. It is comprised of pairs of RGB and Depth frames that have been synchronized and annotated with dense labels for every image. In addition to the projected depth maps, we have included a set of preprocessed depth maps whose missing values have been filled in using the colorization scheme of Levin et al . Unlike, the Raw dataset, the labeled dataset is provided as a Matlab .mat file with the following variables:     accelData &#8211; Nx4 matrix of accelerometer values indicated when each frame was taken. The columns contain the roll, yaw, pitch and tilt angle of the device.   depths &#8211; HxWxN matrix of in-painted depth maps where H and W are the height and width, respectively and N is the number of images. The values of the depth elements are in meters.   images &#8211; HxWx3xN matrix of RGB images where H and W are the height and width, respectively, and N is the number of images.   instances &#8211; HxWxN matrix of instance maps. Use get_instance_masks.m in the Toolbox to recover masks for each object instance in a scene.   labels &#8211; HxWxN matrix of object label masks where H and W are the height and width, respectively and N is the number of images. The labels range from 1..C where C is the total number of classes. If a pixel&#8217;s label value is 0, then that pixel is &#8216;unlabeled&#8217;.   names &#8211; Cx1 cell array of the english names of each class.   namesToIds &#8211; map from english label names to class IDs (with C key-value pairs)   rawDepths &#8211; HxWxN matrix of raw depth maps where H and W are the height and width, respectively, and N is the number of images. These depth maps capture the depth images after they have been projected onto the RGB image plane but before the missing depth values have been filled in. Additionally, the depth non-linearity from the Kinect device has been removed and the values of each depth image are in meters.   rawDepthFilenames &#8211; Nx1 cell array of the filenames (in the Raw dataset) that were used for each of the depth images in the labeled dataset.   rawRgbFilenames &#8211; Nx1 cell array of the filenames (in the Raw dataset) that were used for each of the RGB images in the labeled dataset.   scenes &#8211; Nx1 cell array of the name of the scene from which each image was taken.   sceneTypes &#8211; Nx1 cell array of the scene type from which each image was taken.     Raw Dataset        Output from the RGB camera (left) and depth camera (right). Missing values in the depth image are a result of (a) shadows caused by the disparity between the infrared emitter and camera or (b) random missing or spurious values caused by specular or low albedo surfaces.       The raw dataset contains the raw image and accelerometer dumps from the kinect. The RGB and Depth camera sampling rate lies between 20 and 30 FPS (variable over time). While the frames are not synchronized, the timestamps for each of the RGB, depth and accelerometer files are included as part of each filename and can be synchronized to produce a continuous video using the get_synched_frames.m function in the Toolbox.   The dataset is divided into different folders which correspond to each &#8217;scene&#8217; being filmed, such as &#8216;living_room_0012&#8242; or &#8216;office_0014&#8242;. The file hierarchy is structured as follows:   / ../bedroom_0001/ ../bedroom_0001/a-1294886363.011060-3164794231.dump ../bedroom_0001/a-1294886363.016801-3164794231.dump      ... ../bedroom_0001/d-1294886362.665769-3143255701.pgm ../bedroom_0001/d-1294886362.793814-3151264321.pgm      ... ../bedroom_0001/r-1294886362.238178-3118787619.ppm ../bedroom_0001/r-1294886362.814111-3152792506.ppm   Files that begin with the prefix a- are the accelerometer dumps. These dumps are written to disk in binary and can be read with file get_accel_data.mex. Files that begin with the prefix r- and d- are the frames from the RGB and depth cameras, respectively. Since no preprocessing has been performed, the raw depth images must be projected onto the RGB coordinate space into order to align the images.   Toolbox   The matlab toolbox has several useful functions for handling the data.      camera_params.m - Contains the camera parameters for the Kinect used to capture the data.   crop_image.m &#8211; Crops an image to use only the area when the depth signal is projected.   fill_depth_colorization.m &#8211; Fills in the depth using Levin et al's Colorization method.   fill_depth_cross_bf.m - Fills in the depth using a cross-bilateral filter at multiple scales.   get_accel_data.m - Returns the accelerometer parameters at a specific moment in time.   get_instance_masks.m &#8211; Returns a set of binary masks, one for each object instance in an image.   get_rgb_depth_overlay.m &#8211; Returns a visualization of the RGB and Depth alignment.   get_synched_frames.m - Returns a set of synchronized RGB and Depth frames that can be used to produced RGBD videos of each scene.   get_timestamp_from_filename.m &#8211; Returns the timestamp from the raw dataset filenames. This is useful for sampling the RAW video dumps at even intervals in time.   project_depth_map.m &#8211; Projects the Depth map from the Kinect on the RGB image plane.
