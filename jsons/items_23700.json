In New York City alone, 3.3 million people are food insecure, meaning they do not have access at all times to enough food to lead an active, healthy life. Please join the Wagner Policy Alliance , the Wagner Food Policy Alliance , and the Wagner Health Network for a panel exploring the problem of food insecurity as it exists in local neighborhoods and communities throughout New York City.      The panel will focus on programs and approaches including food stamps, emergency food resources, school meals, and urban farming, to meet short-term food &amp; nutrition needs as well as eliminate hunger, obesity and other health issues in the long-term. Panelists will discuss successes and challenges with implementing these programs on a systemic, neighborhood-wide level and suggest recommendations going forward.

In New York City alone, 3.3 million people are food insecure, meaning they do not have access at all times to enough food to lead an active, healthy life. Please join the Wagner Policy Alliance , the Wagner Food Policy Alliance , and the Wagner Health Network for a panel exploring the problem of food insecurity as it exists in local neighborhoods and communities throughout New York City.      The panel will focus on programs and approaches including food stamps, emergency food resources, school meals, and urban farming, to meet short-term food &amp; nutrition needs as well as eliminate hunger, obesity and other health issues in the long-term. Panelists will discuss successes and challenges with implementing these programs on a systemic, neighborhood-wide level and suggest recommendations going forward.

Throughout the organization\u2019s forty-year history, there has emerged a clear link between the incidence of incarceration and food insecurity. In recent years, The Fortune Society has begun to explore how it can help clients and their families access the healthy foods they need. The Capstone team researched the landscape of food access in New York City and surveyed Fortune Society clients about their experiences with food insecurity. The final report documented the research findings and a GIS map illustrating the relationship between criminal justice involvement and food access in New York City. This map and the corresponding report will serve as a resource for The Fortune Society as the organization develops new food-based client services and advocacy initiatives.                                     \u00a9 NYU Wagner   295 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10012-9604   212.998.7400   Copyright and Fair Use   Contact Us   Sitemap   New York University"}]},

In New York City alone, 3.3 million people are food insecure, meaning they do not have access at all times to enough food to lead an active, healthy life. Please join the Wagner Policy Alliance , the Wagner Food Policy Alliance , and the Wagner Health Network for a panel exploring the problem of food insecurity as it exists in local neighborhoods and communities throughout New York City.      The panel will focus on programs and approaches including food stamps, emergency food resources, school meals, and urban farming, to meet short-term food &amp; nutrition needs as well as eliminate hunger, obesity and other health issues in the long-term. Panelists will discuss successes and challenges with implementing these programs on a systemic, neighborhood-wide level and suggest recommendations going forward.
