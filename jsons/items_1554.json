McLaughlin and NYU Wagner Dean Ellen Schall cordially invite you to attend an Inaugural University Professorship Lecture presented by Hilary Ballon, Deputy Vice Chancellor of NYU Abu Dhabi and Professor of Urban Studies and Architecture at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.       At the center of Hilary Ballon&rsquo;s work as an architectural and urban historian are both a love of cities and a quest to understand the interaction of the built environment and city life. The University Professorship Lecture draws from her current work: a book and exhibition entitled The Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan 1811-2011 , opening at the Museum of the City of New York on December 5.       A reception will immediately follow the lecture.       Registration is now closed for this event. You must be registered to attend.
