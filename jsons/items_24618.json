Behavioral results are the primary end-goals of health and social development programs. The course stresses that behavioral impact comes with the critical support of effective communication programs purposefully planned for behavioral results, and not directed just at awareness creation, advocacy, or public education.    The private sector experience in successfully using Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) for consumer behavioral results points to an approach for achieving behavioral objectives in health and social development. WHO has been applying this approach to various health issues (including emergencies and outbreaks) over the past 14 years and refers to it as &ldquo;COMBI&rdquo;, Communication-for-Behavioral-Impact.    UNICEF has applied the approach, within the framework of its &ldquo;Communication for Development&rdquo; (C4D) concept, to juvenile justice, safe motherhood, HIV/AIDS, promotion of iodized salt, immunization, child protection, child nutrition, early childhood development, and children and violence. UNFPA has applied it to HIV/AIDS prevention and reproductive health. UNDP has used it with gender issues.    IMC/COMBI is not about producing posters, t-shirts, and pamphlets. It applies in an integrated, synchronized way the disciplines of marketing (including village-level marketing traditions), public relations and advocacy, administrative mobilization, advertising, counseling, personal selling, community mobilization, health education, mass communication, folk media, social media, and market research -- dedicated to the ultimate behavioral outcome desired.    The course is intended for health and social development professionals who have the responsibility for designing, supervising, or managing health education, health promotion, communication for development (C4D), and other information-education-communication (IEC) programs to achieve specific behavioral results in health and social development. Prior communication experience is not required for this Institute.    Participants will learn how to apply the 10-Step process of IMC/COMBI in the strategic planning of communication programs for behavioral results. Participants will cover the following topics &ndash; COMBI Foundational Principles; Behavior Adoption; Basic Communication Principles; Role of Communication in Behavioral Impact; Marketing Principles from Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) for Bridging the Knowledge/Action Gap; Integrated, Synchronized Communication Action Areas for IMC/COMBI -- Administrative Mobilization, Public Relations and Mass Media, Advocacy, Community Mobilization and Group Communication, Advertising and Social Media; Personal Selling/Interpersonal Communication/Counseling); Marketing Research and Behavioral Impact Evaluation; Communication for Development (C4D); and Sexual Health Communication and Sexual Attitudes Re-Assessment.  This all culminates in an IMC/COMBI Practicum: In small planning groups, each participant will work on the design of an IMC/COMBI plan for a specific behavioral objective in a health or other social development field.    The Institute Coordinator is Dr. Everold N. Hosein, Senior Communication Advisor-Consultant, World Health Organization (WHO) and Communication Consultant to UNICEF, UNFPA, and UNDP.

The International Education program hosts a panel about girls' education, September 19th, 2014.       About    The International Education Program is part of the global mission of New York University to produce professionals who understand the international implications of their responsibilities and have the ability to utilize knowledge across international boundaries. Improved communications and transportation technologies, transnational business enterprise, the internationalization of popular consumer cultures, and the growth of multinational non-governmental organizations have all contributed to a world in which different nations are more interconnected than ever before.    As the social, political and economic systems of these different nations have become more interdependent, the problems they confront have assumed a global dimension, and cross cultural communication and exchange have become central to their solution. The International Education Program is dedicated to preparing professional educators who can work effectively in international and multinational settings.    The International Education Program sponsors a number of research and training projects through the Multinational Institute of American Studies, a center for public diplomacy that offers noncredit programs in American culture, politics, and society to foreign scholars, diplomats, and journalists. A student-led organization, the International Education Student Board, sponsors lectures and meetings on topics of current interest.    View our PDF brochure to learn more about the International Education program.    Degree Programs in International Education    The International Education program prepares educators for careers in multinational and international settings. The program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students may choose (but are not required) to select one of three specializations: global education; international development education/ education, conflict, and humanitarian action; and cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The M.A. program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the M.A. degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an M.A. degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the M.A. program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, Institute for International Education, Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.

Behavioral results are the primary end-goals of health and social development programs. The course stresses that behavioral impact comes with the critical support of effective communication programs purposefully planned for behavioral results, and not directed just at awareness creation, advocacy, or public education.    The private sector experience in successfully using Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) for consumer behavioral results points to an approach for achieving behavioral objectives in health and social development. WHO has been applying this approach to various health issues (including emergencies and outbreaks) over the past 14 years and refers to it as &ldquo;COMBI&rdquo;, Communication-for-Behavioral-Impact.    UNICEF has applied the approach, within the framework of its &ldquo;Communication for Development&rdquo; (C4D) concept, to juvenile justice, safe motherhood, HIV/AIDS, promotion of iodized salt, immunization, child protection, child nutrition, early childhood development, and children and violence. UNFPA has applied it to HIV/AIDS prevention and reproductive health. UNDP has used it with gender issues.    IMC/COMBI is not about producing posters, t-shirts, and pamphlets. It applies in an integrated, synchronized way the disciplines of marketing (including village-level marketing traditions), public relations and advocacy, administrative mobilization, advertising, counseling, personal selling, community mobilization, health education, mass communication, folk media, social media, and market research -- dedicated to the ultimate behavioral outcome desired.    The course is intended for health and social development professionals who have the responsibility for designing, supervising, or managing health education, health promotion, communication for development (C4D), and other information-education-communication (IEC) programs to achieve specific behavioral results in health and social development. Prior communication experience is not required for this Institute.    Participants will learn how to apply the 10-Step process of IMC/COMBI in the strategic planning of communication programs for behavioral results. Participants will cover the following topics &ndash; COMBI Foundational Principles; Behavior Adoption; Basic Communication Principles; Role of Communication in Behavioral Impact; Marketing Principles from Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) for Bridging the Knowledge/Action Gap; Integrated, Synchronized Communication Action Areas for IMC/COMBI -- Administrative Mobilization, Public Relations and Mass Media, Advocacy, Community Mobilization and Group Communication, Advertising and Social Media; Personal Selling/Interpersonal Communication/Counseling); Marketing Research and Behavioral Impact Evaluation; Communication for Development (C4D); and Sexual Health Communication and Sexual Attitudes Re-Assessment.  This all culminates in an IMC/COMBI Practicum: In small planning groups, each participant will work on the design of an IMC/COMBI plan for a specific behavioral objective in a health or other social development field.

Our master's program focuses on the study of effective adult learning and development support strategies for teaching and learning business concepts and skills in public and private organizations and postsecondary education institutions. Our graduates usually come with solid business content and are able to specialize further and learn theoretical concepts related to adult learning, workplace learning, lifelong learning, instructional design and delivery, curriculum development, and research, preparing them for important educational roles. Job titles of alumni and current students include:       Community College Instructor (accounting, finance, marketing, management)    Senior Learning Specialist    Corporate Sales Trainer; Manager of IT Training and Knowledge Management    Director, Program Design    Curriculum Developer    Workplace Learning Consultant    Organizational Development and Productivity Specialist       Business Education at New York University: The Next Generation This book, co-written by NYU Professor Emeritus Michael Bronner and University of Southern New Hampshire Professor Emeritus Burt Kaliski, follows the 1981 publication Early Leaders in Business Education. The earlier book documents the work and impact of our program's founders, Drs. Paul S. Lomax, Peter L. Agnew, Herbert A. Tonne, and Helen Reynolds. This next edition is designed to document the rich history the Business Education Program has had since that era. At this point, the first two chapters, detailing the contributions of Drs. Karen Gillespie and Padmakar S. Sapre, are complete and available for download here.

Behavioral results are the primary end-goals of health and social development programs. The course stresses that behavioral impact comes with the critical support of effective communication programs purposefully planned for behavioral results, and not directed just at awareness creation, advocacy, or public education.    The private sector experience in successfully using Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) for consumer behavioral results points to an approach for achieving behavioral objectives in health and social development. WHO has been applying this approach to various health issues (including emergencies and outbreaks) over the past 14 years and refers to it as &ldquo;COMBI&rdquo;, Communication-for-Behavioral-Impact.    UNICEF has applied the approach, within the framework of its &ldquo;Communication for Development&rdquo; (C4D) concept, to juvenile justice, safe motherhood, HIV/AIDS, promotion of iodized salt, immunization, child protection, child nutrition, early childhood development, and children and violence. UNFPA has applied it to HIV/AIDS prevention and reproductive health. UNDP has used it with gender issues.    IMC/COMBI is not about producing posters, t-shirts, and pamphlets. It applies in an integrated, synchronized way the disciplines of marketing (including village-level marketing traditions), public relations and advocacy, administrative mobilization, advertising, counseling, personal selling, community mobilization, health education, mass communication, folk media, social media, and market research -- dedicated to the ultimate behavioral outcome desired.    The course is intended for health and social development professionals who have the responsibility for designing, supervising, or managing health education, health promotion, communication for development (C4D), and other information-education-communication (IEC) programs to achieve specific behavioral results in health and social development. Prior communication experience is not required for this Institute.    Participants will learn how to apply the 10-Step process of IMC/COMBI in the strategic planning of communication programs for behavioral results. Participants will cover the following topics &ndash; COMBI Foundational Principles; Behavior Adoption; Basic Communication Principles; Role of Communication in Behavioral Impact; Marketing Principles from Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) for Bridging the Knowledge/Action Gap; Integrated, Synchronized Communication Action Areas for IMC/COMBI -- Administrative Mobilization, Public Relations and Mass Media, Advocacy, Community Mobilization and Group Communication, Advertising and Social Media; Personal Selling/Interpersonal Communication/Counseling); Marketing Research and Behavioral Impact Evaluation; Communication for Development (C4D); and Sexual Health Communication and Sexual Attitudes Re-Assessment.  This all culminates in an IMC/COMBI Practicum: In small planning groups, each participant will work on the design of an IMC/COMBI plan for a specific behavioral objective in a health or other social development field.

The International Education program hosts a panel about girls' education, September 19th, 2014.       About    The International Education Program is part of the global mission of New York University to produce professionals who understand the international implications of their responsibilities and have the ability to utilize knowledge across international boundaries. Improved communications and transportation technologies, transnational business enterprise, the internationalization of popular consumer cultures, and the growth of multinational non-governmental organizations have all contributed to a world in which different nations are more interconnected than ever before.    As the social, political and economic systems of these different nations have become more interdependent, the problems they confront have assumed a global dimension, and cross cultural communication and exchange have become central to their solution. The International Education Program is dedicated to preparing professional educators who can work effectively in international and multinational settings.    The International Education Program sponsors a number of research and training projects through the Multinational Institute of American Studies, a center for public diplomacy that offers noncredit programs in American culture, politics, and society to foreign scholars, diplomats, and journalists. A student-led organization, the International Education Student Board, sponsors lectures and meetings on topics of current interest.    View our PDF brochure to learn more about the International Education program.    Degree Programs in International Education    The International Education program prepares educators for careers in multinational and international settings. The program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students may choose (but are not required) to select one of three specializations: global education; international development education/ education, conflict, and humanitarian action; and cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The M.A. program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the M.A. degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an M.A. degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the M.A. program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, Institute for International Education, Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.
