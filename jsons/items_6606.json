Please select from the links at the left to learn more about each clinic.   Bankruptcy Appellate Clinic   The focus of the Bankruptcy Appellate Clinic is on the provision of appellate legal services to indigent bankrupt individuals. Insolvent individuals file over a million bankruptcy cases each year, generating hundreds of federal appeals. Many of these appeals involve issues of vital importance to the administration of bankruptcy cases and the availability of bankruptcy relief to overburdened consumers. As an indication of the significance of these matters, over the past twenty years the US Supreme Court has routinely granted certiorari to review at least one bankruptcy appeal per term, most often a consumer case. In most (if not all) of these appellate cases, the debtors involved are unable to afford appellate counsel. On the other hand, governmental and creditor interests are typically well represented. A case in point is Bullock v. BankChampaign, NA, no. 11-1518 (2013), a recent matter in the US Supreme Court. Bullock involved an important issue concerning the scope of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy discharge. During the Fall of 2014, the clinic prepared an amicus brief for filing in the US Supreme Court on an important consumer bankruptcy issue in Bank of America v. Caulkett, no. 13-1421 (2015).

It will use the evaluation and presentation of witnesses as the focus through which students learn to lawyer, consider difficult ethical issues, understand the scope and challenges of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and begin to develop case narratives. It combines two closely connected components: fieldwork in the office of the DANY (a minimum of 9 hours per week) and a weekly seminar that will support and supplement the on-site fieldwork. The seminar will employ a combination of readings, discussion, simulation and fieldwork case rounds to insure that every student achieves the goals of the externship.

Please select from the links at the left to learn more about each clinic.   Bankruptcy Appellate Clinic   The focus of the Bankruptcy Appellate Clinic is on the provision of appellate legal services to indigent bankrupt individuals. Insolvent individuals file over a million bankruptcy cases each year, generating hundreds of federal appeals. Many of these appeals involve issues of vital importance to the administration of bankruptcy cases and the availability of bankruptcy relief to overburdened consumers. As an indication of the significance of these matters, over the past twenty years the US Supreme Court has routinely granted certiorari to review at least one bankruptcy appeal per term, most often a consumer case. In most (if not all) of these appellate cases, the debtors involved are unable to afford appellate counsel. On the other hand, governmental and creditor interests are typically well represented. A case in point is Bullock v. BankChampaign, NA, no. 11-1518 (2013), a recent matter in the US Supreme Court. Bullock involved an important issue concerning the scope of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy discharge. During the Fall of 2014, the clinic prepared an amicus brief for filing in the US Supreme Court on an important consumer bankruptcy issue in Bank of America v. Caulkett, no. 13-1421 (2015).

They also participate in seminar discussions of substantive and procedural issues related to the clinic's cases, and in simulation exercises to develop written and oral litigation skills. (Offered Fall 2015 and Spring 2016)   Community Development and Economic Justice Clinic   The focus of this clinic is the provision of civil legal services to grassroots, community organizing groups that engage in a variety of community development, economic justice and social justice efforts.

It will use the evaluation and presentation of witnesses as the focus through which students learn to lawyer, consider difficult ethical issues, understand the scope and challenges of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and begin to develop case narratives. It combines two closely connected components: fieldwork in the office of the DANY (a minimum of 9 hours per week) and a weekly seminar that will support and supplement the on-site fieldwork. The seminar will employ a combination of readings, discussion, simulation and fieldwork case rounds to insure that every student achieves the goals of the externship.

Please select from the links at the left to learn more about each clinic.   Bankruptcy Appellate Clinic   The focus of the Bankruptcy Appellate Clinic is on the provision of appellate legal services to indigent bankrupt individuals. Insolvent individuals file over a million bankruptcy cases each year, generating hundreds of federal appeals. Many of these appeals involve issues of vital importance to the administration of bankruptcy cases and the availability of bankruptcy relief to overburdened consumers. As an indication of the significance of these matters, over the past twenty years the US Supreme Court has routinely granted certiorari to review at least one bankruptcy appeal per term, most often a consumer case. In most (if not all) of these appellate cases, the debtors involved are unable to afford appellate counsel. On the other hand, governmental and creditor interests are typically well represented. A case in point is Bullock v. BankChampaign, NA, no. 11-1518 (2013), a recent matter in the US Supreme Court. Bullock involved an important issue concerning the scope of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy discharge. During the Fall of 2014, the clinic prepared an amicus brief for filing in the US Supreme Court on an important consumer bankruptcy issue in Bank of America v. Caulkett, no. 13-1421 (2015). (Offered Spring 2016)   Brennan Center Public Policy Advocacy Clinic   This clinic studies public policy advocacy in the context of the Brennan Center's work. Strategies and skills the clinic focuses on include: conducting policy analysis and research; engaging in coalition building and organizing; collecting and analyzing opinion data; drafting and negotiating laws and rules; conducting lobbying; developing public education plans and using media effectively; fundraising; and running a nonprofit organization. All students will do fieldwork at the Brennan Center, in one of the Center's main program areas: Democracy (elections and voting rights, money in politics, fair courts, redistricting and responsive government), Justice (access to civil legal aid, mass incarceration and racial justice reform, and promoting community-oriented defense), and Liberty and National Security (transparency and privacy issues and domestic counterterrorism policies, including intelligence collection). (Offered Fall 2015 and Spring 2016)   Business Law Transactions Clinic   Students participating in the Business Law Transactions Clinic provide legal services on transactional and governance matters relating to the business needs of the clinic\u2019s clients. The clinic provides legal services to non-profit organizations, as well as to small businesses, entrepreneurs and social enterprises that may not have access to the traditional legal market and that operate in areas of concern to the public. The students\u2019 work will include planning transactions and drafting contracts, memoranda of understanding, leases, promissory notes, employment agreements and other operating agreements; advising executives and boards on governance and disclosure practices; reviewing and preparing bylaws, conflict-of-interest, investment, social media and other board policies and materials, and employee manuals, committee charters; and developing analytical, planning, editorial and counseling skills in the context of client projects and reality-grounded class work; planning transactions; drafting contracts and other operating agreements; and preparing work plan and other project documents. We have a weekly two-hour seminar, which will focus on the business lawyer\u2019s multiple roles in supporting the clinic\u2019s field work. We also conduct weekly one-hour meetings for each student team with their supervising attorneys and meet at additional times during the week as the client work requires. Taught by adjunct professors Stephanie Abramson and Sean Delany. (Offered Fall 2015 and Spring 2016)   Children's Rights Clinic   This course will examine the legal and ethical issues, and the unique skills involved, in representing adolescent clients. The seminar focuses in particular on child welfare proceedings.

Taught by adjunct professor Tamara Steckler. (Not offered 2015-16)   Civil Litigation - Employment Law Clinic, Semester-Long   In this clinic, taught by Professor Laura Sager, students represent plaintiffs in claims of employment discrimination and failure to pay minimum way or overtime. The cases are brought in federal and state courts and agencies. Students meet with clients, draft pleadings, discovery requests and motions, take depositions, and appear in court for hearings or trials. They also participate in seminar discussions of substantive and procedural issues related to the clinic's cases, and in simulation exercises to develop written and oral litigation skills. (Offered Fall 2015 and Spring 2016)   Community Development and Economic Justice Clinic   The focus of this clinic is the provision of civil legal services to grassroots, community organizing groups that engage in a variety of community development, economic justice and social justice efforts. The clinic seminar focuses on \"movement lawyering\" and the benefits and challenges of lawyering in partnership and collaboration with the communities they work in. Students will learn more about the different roles that lawyers can play in supporting campaigns led by communities to advance social change. Students perform fieldwork with attorneys from the Community Development Project (CDP) of the Urban Justice Center and provide legal services to CDP's clients throughout New York City. Specific casework involves workers' rights litigation, housing code enforcement, and consumer debt defense. Students also assist in capacity building by providing organizations with transactional services in areas such as community benefits agreements, land use, tax exemption, bylaws, and incorporation. . Taught by adjunct professors Amy Tai and Nasoan C. Sheftel-Gomes. (Offered Spring 2016)   Comparative Criminal Justice Clinic: Focus on Domestic Violence   This clinic offers students the opportunity (1) to compare and contrast different nations\u2019 uses of criminal prosecution to combat domestic violence, (2) to develop a critical analysis of the advantages and limitations of various criminal justice strategies, and (3) to work directly with clients in New York City, both complainants and defendants, who are involved in ongoing criminal cases. Taught by Professors Holly Maguigan and Shamita Das Dasgupta. (Not offered 2015-16)   Criminal Appellate Defender Clinic   Students in the clinic, which is operated in conjunction with the Office of the Appellate Defender, represent criminal defendants in appeals of their felony convictions in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department. There may also be opportunities for students to challenge convictions by means of a motion to vacate the conviction in New York County and Bronx County Supreme Courts. Taught by adjunct professors Eunice Lee and Rosemary Herbert. (Offered Spring 2016)   District Attorney of New York Externship   The Manhattan DA (or DANY) Externship will immerse students in local prosecution, build concrete lawyering skills that lie at the heart of the prosecutorial function and exercise of discretion -- the interviewing, evaluation, and presentation of witnesses \u2013 and insure that each student develops the habit of critical reflection. It will use the evaluation and presentation of witnesses as the focus through which students learn to lawyer, consider difficult ethical issues, understand the scope and challenges of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and begin to develop case narratives. It combines two closely connected components: fieldwork in the office of the DANY (a minimum of 9 hours per week) and a weekly seminar that will support and supplement the on-site fieldwork. The seminar will employ a combination of readings, discussion, simulation and fieldwork case rounds to insure that every student achieves the goals of the externship. Taught by adjunct professor Deborah Gramiccioni. (Offered Fall 2015 and Spring 2016)   Education Advocacy Clinic   This clinic represents low-income public school students in New York City school suspension hearings and handles administrative appeals of adverse rulings at school suspension hearings. Clinic students also advocate for support and services to help address children\u2019s behavioral needs so they can return to school successfully. The clinic is part of the Pro Bono Scholars Program (PBSP), which allows law students to take the Bar Exam in February of their 3L year if they commit to spending the last semester of law school working full time on pro bono work through the law school for credit. After law students take the Bar Exam in February, their entire courseload in the Spring semester (March through May) consists of this clinic. Taught by Martin Guggenheim, Randy Hertz and Randi Levine. (Offered Spring 2016)   Education Sector Policy and Consulting Clinic   The United States is undergoing a massive restructuring of public-sector service delivery. Nowhere are these changes more important and challenging than in public education. This full-semester, 14-credit interdisciplinary Clinic brings together graduate students in law, business, education and policy from NYU, Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Michigan, and Stanford (1) to immerse themselves in a study of emerging and competing strategies for K-12 legal and institutional reform, and (2) to engage in intensive, high-priority, multi-dimensional consulting projects (i.e., projects with legal, management, educational and policy components) on behalf of state departments of education, local schools districts, charter-management organizations and other public- and social-sector organizations serving the educational needs of children. The Clinic has three components\u2014a seminar on the governance, regulation, management and democratic accountability of public schools; skills training in a constellation of twenty-first century problem solving competencies; and intensive team-based consulting projects, often on-site with client organizations. The Clinic is offered by the Consortium for Public Research and Leadership, a partnership between NYU Law School and professional schools at the universities listed above. Taught by James S. Liebman at Columbia. (Offered Fall 2015 and Spring 2016)   Environmental Law Clinic   Students work out of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national, non-profit legal and scientific organization, assisting attorneys in bringing public interest environmental litigation. The students also join in a weekly seminar at which current environmental policy issues, environmental litigation and legal advocacy strategies are discussed. Taught by adjunct professors Eric A. Goldstein and Nancy S. Marks. (Offered Fall 2015 and Spring 2016)   Equal Justice and Defender Clinic   This clinic, taught by Professors Bryan Stevenson and Randy Susskind, provides an opportunity to work on racial justice issues or to provide direct assistance to condemned prisoners on death row or children sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. Clinic students doing racial justice work will study the history of racial inequality in the United States and work on projects that engage communities directly impacted by slavery, lynching, racial terror, convict leasing and Jim Crow laws. Projects will be focused on communities in the South that have experienced extreme racial violence and terror with a goal of helping communities confront these histories in a meaningful way. Students working on litigation against extreme punishments will be involved in direct assistance to death row prisoners in Alabama or children serving sentences of life imprisonment without parole. The clinic will involve periodic travel for all students to Deep South communities for investigative work, interviewing and local research. (Offered Fall 2015)   EU Regulatory Policy Clinic (Paris)   This clinic in EU law and policy addresses the rising demand to better understand the European Union\u2019s work by focusing both on its institutional structures and substantive standards. By providing a supplement to the fieldwork component of the EU Regulatory Policy Clinic, it aims at developing \u201cadministrative lawyering\u201d skills and techniques enabling students to acquire a first-hand experience of the EU decision-making processes. The clinic focuses especially on the different avenues enabling citizens not only to gain access to the EU decision-making process but also to analyze, critique and support legislative and regulatory proposals in the areas of public health as well as environmental, consumer, and safety protection. ( Offered Spring 2015 in Paris )   Federal Judicial Practice Externship   The Federal Judicial Practice Externship is designed to teach students about federal practice through exposure to the workings of judicial chambers as well as class sessions that focus on substantive and practical issues of law. Students participating in the class dedicate their time to both a placement with a district court or appellate court judge and a weekly, two-hour seminar. To develop advocacy skills, all students are required to participate in a moot court argument before a panel of three judges. While in chambers, students complete extensive research and writing projects, such as drafting bench memoranda, orders, or opinions on a broad range of subjects, including immigration, criminal law, habeas corpus, and complex commercial disputes. Taught by Michelle Cherande and a Judge Alison Nathan. (Offered Fall 2015)   Global Justice Clinic - for LLMs   The Global Justice Clinic explores how human rights law can be brought to bear on situations of global injustice. Working on cases and projects that involve cross-border human rights violations, the deleterious impacts of extraterritorial activities by state and non-state actors, and emerging problems that require close collaboration between actors at the local and international levels, students engage in human rights advocacy in domestic and international settings. Fieldwork consists of projects undertaken for or in collaboration with individual clients, human rights organizations in the United States and abroad, and intergovernmental human rights experts and bodies (including the United Nations). Fieldwork focuses on issues related to global injustice such as: economic and social rights; human rights, national security, and counter-terrorism; transnational corporate accountability; weapons development; and the human rights of marginalized groups. These projects give students an opportunity to assist in formulating policy, research, and legal responses to cross-border human rights problems. Taught by Meg Satterthwaite and Nikki Reisch. (Offered Fall 2015)   Government Civil Litigation Externship - Eastern District of New York   The U.S. Attorney's Office will select up to twelve students for externships in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), located in Brooklyn. The Civil Division of the EDNY represents the interests of the United States in a wide range of affirmative and defensive civil actions, including in the areas of health care, defense contractor, mortgage fraud, and other qui tam cases brought under the False Claims Act as well as civil rights, asset forfeiture, environmental, employment discrimination, constitutional torts and torts under the Federal Tort Claims action.

A written proposal must be submitted to and approved by the instructor, then submitted to the Office of Academic Services before a student may register. The written proposal ordinarily is at least two pages double-spaced (or at least 1,000 words) and should describe the subject matter of the Directed Research and the issues the student intends to explore in the paper. The student may register by using an add/drop form that Academic Services will supply upon receipt of the signed proposal within the stated deadlines. Directed research credits may be added through September 30 for Fall 2014 and February 10 for Spring 2015 . The usual allocation is two credits. A student may write a one-credit Directed Research but it will not suffice for the Substantial Writing requirement satisfaction . A three-credit Directed Research project is highly unusual and requires the approval of the Vice Dean. Students considering this should contact Academic Services. Also note that requests to late add Directed Research will only be considered if your credit load (not including the Directed Research credits) does not drop below the minimum 12 credits at any point in the semester after the add/drop period. Students who are granted permission to late add Directed Research will not be permitted to drop classes if the result is inconsistent with the above, so please plan your schedule accordingly.   You may ask any full-time faculty member or visiting faculty member to supervise Directed Research. Adjunct professors may supervise Directed Research only with permission of the Vice Dean. A two-credit Directed Research may satisfy the Substantial Writing requirement. Failure to make academic progress on a Directed Research may result in a student\u2019s withdrawal with a grade of \u201cWD.\u201d   After March 15 of the student\u2019s final semester , no faculty member may accept a request from a student to perform directed research or other work for law school credit unless the student has first received the approval of the Vice Dean. The Vice Dean may allow such work if the student needs the credit for May graduation and July bar certification subject to the following:     No more than two (2) credits can be earned in this manner.   In making his or her decision, the Vice Dean shall consider (a) the date of the student\u2019s request; (b) the nature of the proposal; and (c) whether the missing credits or the timing of the student\u2019s request are the result of circumstances that were within the student\u2019s ability to avoid. Failure of the student to properly calculate his or her credits at an earlier time, failure in a course, and removal from a course for excessive absences are examples of circumstances within the student\u2019s control to avoid.   If the missing credits result from circumstances outside the student\u2019s control, the Vice Dean will permit the credit if at all academically reasonable.   If the Vice Dean approves the student\u2019s application, it will be the student\u2019s responsibility to find a faculty member willing to supervise the student\u2019s proposed work and award the credit in a timely manner.     JD students can use a two-credit Directed Research to satisfy the Substantial Writing requirement.
