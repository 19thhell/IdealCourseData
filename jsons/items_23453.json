Borderline tells the story of actress Jill Powell, a single lesbian mom raising a transgender child while herself struggling with borderline personality disorder; and Dr. Cecilia Dintino, her intrepid therapist, who adopts a cutting-edge approach to treating her client, helping to save the client\u2019s life and transforming them both in the process.   \u201cThis play is Drama Therapy in action,\u201d said Dave Mowers, Producing Director of the \u201cAs Performance\u201d series at NYU Drama Therapy Program, where he also serves as Adjunct Professor, and director of Borderline. \u201cThe performance exists at the borderline of art and clinical work. Audiences are invited into the treatment space created by client and therapist over ten years of hard and intimate work. The actors live in a space on the borderline of real and rehearsed. The play is the therapy and the therapy is the play.\u201d   Borderline is the fruit of a bold experiment on the part of Powell and Dintino, the latter of whom is an Adjunct Professor of Drama Therapy at Steinhardt. Dintino approached Robert Landy \u2013 director, writer, drama therapy pioneer and Professor of Educational Theatre and Applied Psychology at Steinhardt - to write the play in an attempt to help Powell\u2019s progress. Landy then convened 18 hours of intensive workshops with Powell and Dintino, creating a play with songs, set to music by Tony Award Winning Orchestrator, Michael Starobin.   A three-month engagement of therapeutic rehearsals under the direction of NYU faculty member Dave Mowers culminates in four public performances at the Provincetown Playhouse on the following dates:   Thursday, November 13, 8 PM  Friday, November 14, 8 PM  Saturday, November 15, 8 PM  Sunday, November 16 at 2 PM   Powell was once a promising Broadway musical theater performer and TV actress, but the onset of borderline personality disorder made work impossible for her.   \u201cI have a mind that takes in too much, eyes that see everything and a heart that is affected by all. Hyper compassionate and hyper sad,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the pain happens and is not dealt with skillfully, when I cannot get away, my mind tells my heart that the pain is too much to bare and then I want to die.\u201d   After reaching an impasse in her treatment, Powell and her therapist realized the need for a new plan. Powell wanted to tell her story, and according to Dintino, \u201cWe felt like taking this approach was the only way we could move forward. And Jill was very interested in how the play could give people a sense of what living with borderline personality disorder is really like.\u201d   The result is a poignant and personal one-hour play that exposes the complexities of learning to live and to cope with borderline personality disorder. BORDERLINE is produced by NYU Drama Therapy Program at Steinhardt, through a grant from The Billy Rose Foundation. It is part of the therapeutic theatre series, AS PERFORMANCE.

Robert Landy , founder of Steinhardt\u2019s Drama Therapy Program, wrote the musical after being approached by Dintino, a clinical psychologist and drama therapist, about her patient, Powell &#8212; \u00a0a Broadway musical theater performer and TV actress, who had become resistant to conventional psychotherapy.   An Interview with Drama Therapist, Robert Landy       Borderline feels part theatre, part therapy session, can you talk about this &#8220;cutting-edge&#8221; genre &#8212; is this drama therapy as you practice it?   This is therapeutic theatre. a\u00a0form we&#8217;ve been innovating at NYU for some years now. Most of drama therapy practice is not about performance, but working with groups through a process of play and improvisational role-playing. Therapeutic theatre is getting back to the art form of performance in front of an audience, and working through a therapeutic process with the actors in rehearsal. Our belief is that through this form of therapeutic theatre, changes can occur both to the performers and to the audience members. We are currently working on strategies to research this premise.   Is it common or unusual for an audience to be &#8220;invited in&#8221; to a session or \u00a0performance in drama therapy?   This is common. In drama therapy, groups are well defined within various institutional or private practice settings. In therapeutic theatre, we also invite a receptive audience. \u00a0If the topic of the performance is, as in our play, borderline personality disorder, we invite a community of people &#8212; family members, friends, professionals, and academics &#8212; who are aware of the disorder or who want to know more about it.   How long did it take to write &#8216;Borderline&#8217; a nd do you have plans to perform it again?     We worked on this piece over a period of about eight months, beginning with sessions that I held with both actors, Jill and Cecilia, who, in fact, shared their real-life stories with me.   From there, I wrote a play based upon their stories, then added music, composed brilliantly by Michael Starobin.

Borderline tells the story of actress Jill Powell, a single lesbian mom raising a transgender child while herself struggling with borderline personality disorder; and Dr. Cecilia Dintino, her intrepid therapist, who adopts a cutting-edge approach to treating her client, helping to save the client\u2019s life and transforming them both in the process.   \u201cThis play is Drama Therapy in action,\u201d said Dave Mowers, Producing Director of the \u201cAs Performance\u201d series at NYU Drama Therapy Program, where he also serves as Adjunct Professor, and director of Borderline. \u201cThe performance exists at the borderline of art and clinical work. Audiences are invited into the treatment space created by client and therapist over ten years of hard and intimate work. The actors live in a space on the borderline of real and rehearsed. The play is the therapy and the therapy is the play.\u201d   Borderline is the fruit of a bold experiment on the part of Powell and Dintino, the latter of whom is an Adjunct Professor of Drama Therapy at Steinhardt. Dintino approached Robert Landy \u2013 director, writer, drama therapy pioneer and Professor of Educational Theatre and Applied Psychology at Steinhardt - to write the play in an attempt to help Powell\u2019s progress. Landy then convened 18 hours of intensive workshops with Powell and Dintino, creating a play with songs, set to music by Tony Award Winning Orchestrator, Michael Starobin.   A three-month engagement of therapeutic rehearsals under the direction of NYU faculty member Dave Mowers culminates in four public performances at the Provincetown Playhouse on the following dates:   Thursday, November 13, 8 PM  Friday, November 14, 8 PM  Saturday, November 15, 8 PM  Sunday, November 16 at 2 PM   Powell was once a promising Broadway musical theater performer and TV actress, but the onset of borderline personality disorder made work impossible for her.   \u201cI have a mind that takes in too much, eyes that see everything and a heart that is affected by all. Hyper compassionate and hyper sad,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the pain happens and is not dealt with skillfully, when I cannot get away, my mind tells my heart that the pain is too much to bare and then I want to die.\u201d   After reaching an impasse in her treatment, Powell and her therapist realized the need for a new plan. Powell wanted to tell her story, and according to Dintino, \u201cWe felt like taking this approach was the only way we could move forward. And Jill was very interested in how the play could give people a sense of what living with borderline personality disorder is really like.\u201d   The result is a poignant and personal one-hour play that exposes the complexities of learning to live and to cope with borderline personality disorder. BORDERLINE is produced by NYU Drama Therapy Program at Steinhardt, through a grant from The Billy Rose Foundation. It is part of the therapeutic theatre series, AS PERFORMANCE.   Provincetown Playhouse is located at133 MacDougal Street in Manhattan. Admission is: $15, $5 for students &amp; seniors.

Robert Landy , founder of Steinhardt\u2019s Drama Therapy Program, wrote the musical after being approached by Dintino, a clinical psychologist and drama therapist, about her patient, Powell &#8212; \u00a0a Broadway musical theater performer and TV actress, who had become resistant to conventional psychotherapy.   An Interview with Drama Therapist, Robert Landy       Borderline feels part theatre, part therapy session, can you talk about this &#8220;cutting-edge&#8221; genre &#8212; is this drama therapy as you practice it?   This is therapeutic theatre. a\u00a0form we&#8217;ve been innovating at NYU for some years now. Most of drama therapy practice is not about performance, but working with groups through a process of play and improvisational role-playing. Therapeutic theatre is getting back to the art form of performance in front of an audience, and working through a therapeutic process with the actors in rehearsal. Our belief is that through this form of therapeutic theatre, changes can occur both to the performers and to the audience members. We are currently working on strategies to research this premise.   Is it common or unusual for an audience to be &#8220;invited in&#8221; to a session or \u00a0performance in drama therapy?   This is common. In drama therapy, groups are well defined within various institutional or private practice settings. In therapeutic theatre, we also invite a receptive audience. \u00a0If the topic of the performance is, as in our play, borderline personality disorder, we invite a community of people &#8212; family members, friends, professionals, and academics &#8212; who are aware of the disorder or who want to know more about it.   How long did it take to write &#8216;Borderline&#8217; a nd do you have plans to perform it again?     We worked on this piece over a period of about eight months, beginning with sessions that I held with both actors, Jill and Cecilia, who, in fact, shared their real-life stories with me.   From there, I wrote a play based upon their stories, then added music, composed brilliantly by Michael Starobin. Then we turned over the process to our extraordinary director, Dave Mowers , also a drama therapist, who took the actors through &#8212; not only an aesthetic experience &#8212; but a deeply therapeutic one.   As to the future, we need to evaluate the process and the product within the therapeutic theatre and drama therapy community. We are going to have a a discussion with the entire community next week and will be spending lots of time with the artists involved in the piece evaluating its effectiveness. \u00a0We&#8217;ll be making plans about the future of Borderline after the evaluation.
