The International Education Program sponsors a number of research and training projects through the Multinational Institute of American Studies, a center for public diplomacy that offers noncredit programs in American culture, politics, and society to foreign scholars, diplomats, and journalists.

View our PDF brochure to learn more about the International Education program.    Degree Programs in International Education    The International Education program prepares educators for careers in multinational and international settings. The program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students may choose (but are not required) to select one of three specializations: global education; international development education/ education, conflict, and humanitarian action; and cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The M.A. program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the M.A. degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an M.A. degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the M.A. program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, Institute for International Education, Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.

The International Education program hosts a panel about girls' education, September 19th, 2014.       About    The International Education Program is part of the global mission of New York University to produce professionals who understand the international implications of their responsibilities and have the ability to utilize knowledge across international boundaries. Improved communications and transportation technologies, transnational business enterprise, the internationalization of popular consumer cultures, and the growth of multinational non-governmental organizations have all contributed to a world in which different nations are more interconnected than ever before.    As the social, political and economic systems of these different nations have become more interdependent, the problems they confront have assumed a global dimension, and cross cultural communication and exchange have become central to their solution. The International Education Program is dedicated to preparing professional educators who can work effectively in international and multinational settings.    The International Education Program sponsors a number of research and training projects through the Multinational Institute of American Studies, a center for public diplomacy that offers noncredit programs in American culture, politics, and society to foreign scholars, diplomats, and journalists. A student-led organization, the International Education Student Board, sponsors lectures and meetings on topics of current interest.    View our PDF brochure to learn more about the International Education program.    Degree Programs in International Education    The International Education program prepares educators for careers in multinational and international settings. The program develops educational experts who can design, implement, manage and evaluate international education programs in schools, colleges, foundations, multinational corporations, and public and private educational and cultural agencies. Guided by career interest, professional experience, and educational background, students may choose (but are not required) to select one of three specializations: global education; international development education/ education, conflict, and humanitarian action; and cross cultural exchange and training. The Program has a multidisciplinary faculty, consisting of anthropologists, economists, historians, philosophers, political scientists and sociologists, who apply the theoretical, conceptual and methodological advances in the humanities and the social sciences to the analysis of international educational policies and institutions.    No specific undergraduate major is required to gain admission to the Master of Arts program , but an applicant should have some course work in the social sciences and be able to demonstrate aptitude for analytic work on a range of issues in education. The M.A. program requires a minimum of 40 credits: Foundations in International Education (12 credits); Policy Analysis (8 credits); Internship (4 credits); and the remaining credits in Area Studies and Specialization in International Education.    The International Education Program offers a one-year Advanced Certificate for teachers and practitioners in the field of international education who already have the M.A. degree. The Advanced Certificate is designed for experienced teachers in schools and educational agencies committed to global education, and for mid career consultants and international education specialists in corporate, public, and nonprofit sectors, including field coordinators, planners, evaluators, administrators and program managers. The Advanced Certificate requires a minimum of 30 credits and can be completed in one year, consisting of two terms of full-time academic course work, and, for some students, the summer as well. This is a flexible program in which students, in addition to taking the basic courses in the Foundations of International Education (12 credits), may develop a concentration that links educational research to policy and practice and is of immediate practical use to them.    Applicants to the Ph.D. program should have an M.A. degree in an area of the humanities, social sciences or education related to international education, and they must take the aptitude test of the Graduate Record Examination. The Ph.D. degree requires the completion of a minimum of 54 credits and a dissertation: Foundations of Education (6 credits); Foundations in International Education (12 credits); International Education Doctoral Seminars (12 credits); Specialization in International Education (8-12credits); Area Studies (8-12 credits); Research Courses (6-12 points); Readings and Dissertation Seminars (0-12 points).    Students in the M.A. program participate in a job-related internship that provides professional work experience and reinforces academic skills. Internships may be arranged in the United States or abroad through such organizations as the United Nations, Institute for International Education, Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies, Metro International, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, the Hudson Institute, and the Asia Society.
