Currently, our primary job is to offer various services to artists we partner with in order to further their development. Our most recent successes are listed below:    Fall 2014    Coming Soon! Keep an eye on the various social media pages for now, which can be found on the about tab.    Spring 2014    During this semester, Village Records partnered with former NYU Clive Davis student, Kiah Victoria . The class&rsquo;s time with Kiah proved to be a huge success. The team aided in promoting her various ventures, including her shows at Joe&rsquo;s Pub . Before hand, the team planned a live-streamed acoustic concert from NYU&rsquo;s own Washington Square Park in order to get the word out about the performances. The preview for this acoustic performance can be found here . The Village Records team continues to keep in contact with the talented artist.    Fall 2013    For the fall semesters, Village Records has started partnering with CMJ Music Marathon. This partnership includes working with a CMJ artist, promoting them through various socials, and during this semester, Village Records had the pleasure of documenting their time through a series of three articles on Billboard. The articles can be found below.    The artist the team chose to work with was the Australian band, Tigertown . In conjunction with the Dolan Studios, Village Records recorded the band&rsquo;s latest single &ldquo;What You Came Here For&rdquo; and filmed it for the band to post. Village Records hopes to continue producing the CMJ Sessions.    &ldquo;What You Came Here for&rdquo; CMJ Sessions @ NYU       Billboard Story Part 1 , Part 2 , and Part 3                 Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions - 35 W. 4th Street, Suite 1077 -  New York, NY 10012 -  212 998 5424    This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
