The field encourages students to explore the social, cultural, and political meanings and uses of gender constructs and to challenge traditional narratives about men and women across history. Our field draws its strength from our faculty\u2019s commitment to investigating the history of women and gender, and from a long tradition of feminist scholarship.    Our field brings together faculty and graduate students from a wide range of geographical, chronological, and thematic fields, and is strengthened by departmental fields in African Diaspora and Atlantic World . NYU also has a strong Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality , and our graduate students are encouraged to take courses with scholars of gender in other university departments. Admission to the program is highly selective.    Earning an MA degree in the History of Women and Gender field prepares students for a variety of careers, including working in museums, historical societies, and historic houses; working with archives and historical papers; working in film and television; and preparation for teaching at the secondary-school level. The degree can also serve as a foundation for graduate study at the PhD level.

Once a field of specialization has been determined (normally by the end of the first semester) students should select a faculty advisor from among the program\u2019s core faculty*. To complete course requirements, students must register for an independent study course with the advisor as the thesis is being written.

The field encourages students to explore the social, cultural, and political meanings and uses of gender constructs and to challenge traditional narratives about men and women across history. Our field draws its strength from our faculty\u2019s commitment to investigating the history of women and gender, and from a long tradition of feminist scholarship.    Our field brings together faculty and graduate students from a wide range of geographical, chronological, and thematic fields, and is strengthened by departmental fields in African Diaspora and Atlantic World . NYU also has a strong Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality , and our graduate students are encouraged to take courses with scholars of gender in other university departments. Admission to the program is highly selective.    Earning an MA degree in the History of Women and Gender field prepares students for a variety of careers, including working in museums, historical societies, and historic houses; working with archives and historical papers; working in film and television; and preparation for teaching at the secondary-school level. The degree can also serve as a foundation for graduate study at the PhD level.

Drawing on the  histories of African, Asian, Latino, European, and Native Americans  of both genders and many sexualities, explores the complex and  important intersection of gender, race, and sexuality in the United  States from the 17th century through the 20th, in historically  related case studies. Starting in the period of European imperialism  in the Americas, examines the ways that gender, race, and sexuality  shaped cultural and political policies and debates surrounding the  Salem witch trials; slavery, abolition, and lynching; U.S.  imperialism in Puerto Rico and Hawaii; the politics of welfare and  reproduction; cultural constructions of manliness, masculinity, and  citizenship; and responses to the AIDS pandemic in a global context. Sex and the City SCA-UA 420 Offered every other year. 4 points. This class explores the regulation, organization, suppression and celebration of sexuality in cities around the globe, with a special focus on New York City. The course begins with an examination of the history of the concept \u201csexuality,\u201d then considers the history of urban sex work, sexual migration, sexual minorities and cultural production, and sex law from the 19th century to the present. It includes a special focus on the ways that the politics of sexuality have intersected with the politics of race, gender, class, religion, and citizenship.

This course examines the limits and possibilities of transnational feminist practices and theories. What does it mean to be \u201ctransnationally literate\u201d in relation to gender and sexuality? How do notions of gender and sexuality shift in the context of the gendered travel, displacements and diasporas created by globalization? How are these contemporary movements shadowed by prior movements precipitated by earlier histories of colonialism, indentured labor and slavery? This course explores these questions by looking at a variety of theoretical essays, novels, films, and other cultural texts. Queer Histories SCA-UA 475 Offered every other year. 4 points. Does history matter in contemporary queer politics? Does the history of marriage as an institution make any difference in the fight over gay marriage? Do histories of medieval gender-crossing matter for transgender politics today? Do the historical legacies of the racial politics of public health shape organizing for HIV prevention and treatment around the world today? In this mid-level seminar, we will explore the different meanings and uses of queer history. These histories will be critically examined within a global context, and related to histories of modernity, capitalism and imperialism. Students will also consider the significance of historical hierarchies of race, gender, class and nation in interaction with histories of sexuality. Topics include cultures and subcultures, sexual practices and meanings, legal regulation, science/biology, public policy, politics and activism.
