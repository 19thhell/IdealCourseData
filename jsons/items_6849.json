Description       &quot;The poem of force,&quot; according to Simone Weil, the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0is also a poem of forceful influence. In this course we will read the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0intensively, followed by an examination of its heritage on the dramatic stage. In the first half of the semester we will primarily explore the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0in terms of the poetics of traditionality; the political economy of epic; the ideologics of the\u00a0 M\u00e4nnerbund \u00a0(the &quot;band of fighting brothers&quot;); the\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0's uses of reciprocity; its construction of gender; its intimations of tragedy.
