Comparative literature is an innovative major that encourages students to follow their passion for literature by venturing beyond national and disciplinary boundaries. In the spirit of our times, students delve into literature from all over the world and explore its intersections with other media and disciplines, such as cinema studies, art history, philosophy, politics, anthropology, history, linguistics. Comparative literature departmental course offerings include classes in world literature and interdisciplinary studies where students work intensively with a distinguished faculty of scholars in African, Caribbean, Chinese, European and Anglo-American, Latin American, Middle Eastern and Islamic, and Russian and Eastern European literary and cultural studies. At the same time, the major encourages students to take advantage of the rich offerings of courses in other NYU departments or study abroad.    The guidelines of our program allow students great flexibility in shaping a course of study suited to their own intellectual goals.

Machine learning and     computational statistics also play a central role in data     science. In this graduate-level class, students will learn     about the theoretical foundations of machine learning and     computational statistics and how to apply these to solve     new problems. This is a required course for the MS in Data     Science and should be taken in the first year of study; it     is also suitable for MS and Ph.D. students in Computer     Science and related fields (see pre-requisites below).           This course is part of a two course series, although it     can be taken individually.

However, when being stuck on a problem, I encourage     you to collaborate with other students in the class, subject    to the following rules:               You may discuss a problem with any student in this     class, and work together on solving it. This can involve     brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem, going     together through possible solutions, but should not      involve one student telling another a complete solution.                Once you solve the homework, you must write up      your solutions on your own , without looking at     other people's write-ups or giving your write-up to     others.                In your solution for each problem, you must write      down the names of any person with whom you     discussed it. This will not affect your grade.                Do not consult solution manuals or other people's     solutions from similar courses.           Late submission policy : During the    semester you are allowed at most two extensions on the    homework assignment. Each extension is for at most 48 hours    and carries a penalty of 25% off your assignment."}]},

Machine learning and     computational statistics also play a central role in data     science. In this graduate-level class, students will learn     about the theoretical foundations of machine learning and     computational statistics and how to apply these to solve     new problems. This is a required course for the MS in Data     Science and should be taken in the first year of study; it     is also suitable for MS and Ph.D. students in Computer     Science and related fields (see pre-requisites below).           This course is part of a two course series, although it     can be taken individually. The second course, DS-GA-1005:      Inference and Representation , will be offered in     Fall 2014 (see an approximate     list of topics).

However, when being stuck on a problem, I encourage     you to collaborate with other students in the class, subject    to the following rules:               You may discuss a problem with any student in this     class, and work together on solving it. This can involve     brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem, going     together through possible solutions, but should not      involve one student telling another a complete solution.                Once you solve the homework, you must write up      your solutions on your own , without looking at     other people's write-ups or giving your write-up to     others.                In your solution for each problem, you must write      down the names of any person with whom you     discussed it. This will not affect your grade.                Do not consult solution manuals or other people's     solutions from similar courses.           Late submission policy : During the    semester you are allowed at most two extensions on the    homework assignment. Each extension is for at most 48 hours    and carries a penalty of 25% off your assignment."}, {"content": "NYU &gt; Courant Institute &gt; CIMS Bulletin                                                                                            New York University    Faculty of Arts and Science    College of Arts and Science    Graduate School of Arts and Science                    CIMS Login                                         go                   Institute     Home   Educational Programs   People   Publications   Seminars and Events   Alumni   Mathematics   Computer Science   Atmosphere Ocean Science   Research Centers       Resources     Academic Calendar   Computing Resources   Contact Info   Courant Library   Getting to Courant       In House     CIMS Committees   CIMS Directory    Classroom Calendar   Guide to Services              CIMS Bulletin              Special Events       Special Events Calendar    Courant Lectures     Math Seminars      Algebraic Geometry Seminar    Analysis Seminar    Applied Math Lab Seminar    Applied Mathematics Seminar    Atmosphere Ocean Science Colloquium    Atmosphere Ocean Science Student Seminar    Biomathematics / Computational Biology Colloquium    Computational Neuroscience and Biology Seminars    Dynamical Systems Seminar    Geometric Analysis and Topology Seminar    Geometry Seminar    Grad Student &amp; Postdoc Seminar    Harmonic Analysis and Signal Processing Seminar    Magneto-Fluid Dynamics Seminar    Mathematical Finance Seminar    Mathematics Colloquium    Number Theory Seminar    Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing Seminar    NYU Poly Mathematics Colloquium    Probability and Mathematical Physics Seminar    Student Probability Seminar        CS Seminars      CS Colloquium     Cryptography Seminar    Formal Methods Seminar    Machine Learning Seminar     Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing Seminar    Theory Seminar        Previous Bulletins      See Previous Bulletins          Monday, April 27, 2015     Courant Lectures Part I     3:30PM,  WWH 109    Title: The Cryptographic Lens   Professor Shafi Goldwasser, ACM Turing Award Laureate and the RSA Professor of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at MIT and Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute   http://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/seminars/courant_lectures/2015_part1       Tuesday, April 28, 2015     Courant Lectures Part II     11:00AM,  WWH 102    Title: On Time and Order in Cryptography   Professor Shafi Goldwasser, ACM Turing Award Laureate and the RSA Professor of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at MIT and Professor of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute   http://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/seminars/courant_lectures/2015_part2         BIOMATHEMATICS/COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY COLLOQUIUM     12:30PM,  WWH 1314    Title: Universal Structure in the Modulation of Neuronal Excitability:        Synaptic Control of Coding, Resonance, and Network Synchronization   Christoph Kirst, The Rockefeller University   http://cob.as.nyu.edu/object/cob.ne.colloquium         Algebraic Geometry Seminar     3:30PM,  WWH 201    Title: From Quantum Groups to Noncommutative Geometry   Dimitri Gourevitch, Universit\u00e9 de Valenciennes   http://cims.nyu.edu/~zakharov/algsem_s15.html         Geometry Seminar     6:00PM,  WWH 1314    Title: Some connections between measure partitions and polynomial partitioning.
