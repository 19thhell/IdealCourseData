Romani music has long been an object of fascination for artists, audiences, and scholars. Such interest has resulted in a large number of musical, literary, visual, cinematic, journalistic, and academic works that deliver representations of Romani communities and cultures. Frequently evoking encounters with a mysterious, exotic people, these works reflect the way in which non-Romanies have \"listened to\" Romanies and vice versa. Ideas about how Romanies sound (or should sound) shape popular notions of Romani identities and situate Romani people in their social and political worlds. Through the study of Romani musics in different contexts, this course aims to develop students' critical listening and analysis skills as it incites students to think about listening as a socially and culturally consequential practice. The Art of Listening: Sonic Spaces - MUSIC-UA 3 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00 - 3:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Akiva Zamcheck Music and sound are perceived in a space. Each and every space is unique, but there are familiar types of spaces. The classroom in which we are meeting twice a week is a unique space with particular resonant qualities. It is also a social space defined by the context; a introductory music class in a lecture hall in a university. Musical practices may be considered as spaces in and of themselves, reflecting conditions and ideologies, along with ways of listening. In this class, we will listen to and study musical and sonic spaces (practices) firstly as a static thing, reflecting a tradition with structural tendencies and a set of values; secondly, as a fluid thing, reflecting technological and social change; thirdly, as an ephemeral thing, realized and experienced by [us] in a particular space and time. The Art of Listening: North Indian Acoustic Culture - MUSIC-UA 3 (section 003) Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30 - 10:45 (Room TBA) Instructor: Allen Roda North India has countless diverse musical traditions that cannot be   easily summarized in a single semester. To introduce students to the   variety, aesthetics, and poetry of these traditions, this course is   divided into three units. We begin with Hindustani classical music and   use it as a vehicle to understand some of the aesthetics that are   present in many other musical traditions of the North, particularly   concepts of raga and tala , and the importance of tonal embellishment, rhythmic improvisation, and the structure of classical presentations ( alap, jod, jhala ,   etc.). In the next section we continue our aesthetic discussions of   pitch and rhythm while bringing in a greater discussion of poetry and   the use of musical vehicles for devotional purposes. Through the   authorial voices of legendary saints and poets Kabir, Mirabai, Amir   Khusrao, and Ghalib, we will explore devotional music as expressed in   multiple genres and religions. We conclude this section with discussion   of folk songs of the Bhojpuri language region and their use in everyday   life and in specific ritual contexts (such as weddings and funerals).   The final unit focuses exclusively on the 20th century and contemporary   North Indian popular music. Starting with the all-important Bollywood   film industry and the production of \"item numbers,\" we then transition   to encounters between Indian music and Non-Indian musical traditions,   particularly western classical music and jazz. Finally, we look at the   Punjabi dance music, bhangra , its international popularity   (particularly in the U.K. and the United States) and its intersection   with hip-hop and other popular dance music genre. Section 003 only - Area of study: Music, Histories, Cultures             Elements of Music - MUSIC-UA 20 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30 - 10:45 (Silver 320) Additional recitation section required Instructor: TBA Explores the underlying principles and inner workings of the tonal system, a system that has guided all of Western music from the years 1600 to 1900. It includes a discussion of historical background and evolution. The focus is on concepts and notation of key, scale, tonality, and rhythm. Related skills in sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard harmony are stressed in the recitation sections. History of European Music: Opera - MUSIC-UA 102 (\"Through the Proscenium Arch: Operatic Junkets into Wonderland\") Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller From   the beginnings of opera in the late 16th century, composers and   librettists have taken audiences far from their real world into the   realms of ancient lore and exotic locales. This course will examine a   selection of operas written over the last four centuries that were   purposely crafted as remote from the day-to-day life of the contemporary   audiences. The discussion will seek to provide political, social, and   musical rationales not only to explain the unfamiliar narrative settings   (Scott Joplin's Treemonisha or Kurt Weill's Mahagonny ) and the fantastic backgrounds (Mozart's Seraglio and Strauss's \u00e4 gypyische Helena ), but also to identify the modus operandi of   both composer and librettist as they conjured up the bizarre and   mysterious, the striking and the exceptional that made their audiences   keep coming back for more. Area of study: Music, Histories, Cultures Anthropology of Music: Music and Identity in the African Diaspora - MUSIC-UA 153 . 001 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00-12:15 (Room TBA) Instructor: Maureen Mahon This semester we will examine some of the theoretical and methodological approaches ethnomusicologists, anthropologists, and other scholars use to study the ways people in the African diaspora use music and music-making to construct and express who they are. We will relate our discussion to issues of identity formation, globalization, representation, authenticity, appropriation, political economy, and aesthetics. We will explore the genres of gospel, dancehall, Afro-beat, and rock in the United States, the Caribbean, and West Africa (genres may be expanded/revised over time). Course requirements: Students are expected to complete the readings, attend class regularly, and participate in class discussions. You will submit two short papers (5-7 pages) in which you respond to a prompt from the instructor about course material, and complete a take-home final. You will also conduct independent ethnographic research on music and identity at a local research site of your choice; you will report on this research in a paper due at the end of the semester. In addition, you will submit a Music and Identity Meditation essay early in the semester; this required paper will not be graded. Your papers should reflect your familiarity with assigned readings, material discussed in lectures, guest lectures, and films and music presented in class and as listening assignments. Timely submission of work is mandatory. The instructor will not accept late papers and will not give incompletes for this course. Area of study: Music, Histories, Cultures Intro to Celtic Music - MUSIC-UA 182 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 3:30-4:45 (Silver 320) Instructor: Ivan Goff Provides a comprehensive introduction to the traditional and contemporary music of the Celtic areas of Western Europe: Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and Galicia. Recordings and live performances present the extraordinary range of singing styles and the musical instruments employed in each culture, including harps, bagpipes, and a variety of other wind, free reed, keyboard, and stringed instruments. Forms and musical styles are explored in depth, along with a study of their origin, evolution, and cultural links. Area of study: Sonic Materials of Music  Harmony &amp; Counterpoint I - MUSIC-UA 201 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00 - 12:15 (Silver 320) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 11:00-12:15 (Silver 320) Additional recitation section required Instructors: TBA Please refer to Albert for lab sections General principles underlying tonal musical organization.

Area of study: Sonic Materials of Music Principles of Musical Analysis: Timbre Studies, Sound from the Inside Out - MUSIC-UA 209 Tuesday 3:30-6:00 (Room TBA) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman An in-depth look at timbre as an organizational and expressive feature in a range of musics, drawing mostly, but not exclusively, on the 20th-21st-centuries. The repertoire we will consider will encompass acoustic (instrumental and vocal) musics, electroacoustic musics, Western art musics, non-Western musical examples, and selected examples from Rock, punk, and electronica. Our exploration will extend to the role timbre plays in our perceiving sound in space, and the role timbre has played in style definition. Area of study: Analytical and Critical Thinking Principles of Composition MUSIC-UA 307 Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:30-1:45 (Room TBA) Instructor: TBA Explores various compositional techniques, with an emphasis on modern-day writing procedures.
