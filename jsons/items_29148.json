By the late 1960s, it evolved from early roots in styles like jazz to become a powerful and influential standalone genre and culture popularized by figures like James Brown and Sly Stone. In many ways, funk has become the dominant sound of popular music in the 21st century. In this course, students will study the history, culture and politics of funk, as we track its crossover rise in the 1960s and 1970s, its relationship to disco and sampling in hip-hop, its ability to engage protest and subversive politics, and the way the music continues to be informed by issues of race, nationalism, class, gender and sexuality. This particular iteration of the funk class will focus primarily on the cultural contributions of two of funk's greatest visionaries: George Clinton, bandleader of musical group/army Parliament-Funkadelic, and Maurice White, the under-recognized architect of multi-format crossover band Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. As we listen to audio and watch video clips, read scholarly and journalistic writing on funk, and conduct original research projects about the music, we'll see how the turbulent politics of the 1970s found unique expression in EWF and P-Funk's respective recordings, lyrics, artwork and stage shows.

On Tuesday, September 18th, Professor Fine and Professor King hosted music industry legend George Clinton who was accompanied by members of his staff and Wu-Tang Clan associate Saadiq. From The All Music Guide: \"Clinton was the mastermind behind Parliament and Funkadelic groups that revolutionized R&amp;B during the '70s, twisting soul music into funk by adding influences from several late-'60s acid heroes: Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, and Sly Stone. The Parliament/Funkadelic machine ruled black music during the '70s, capturing over 40 R&amp;B hit singles (including three number ones) and recording three platinum albums.... In 1997 Parliament/Funkadelic was inducted into the R&amp;R Hall of Fame.\" During the one-hour visit, Clinton discussed the musical and cultural power of funk, and his changing role in the music business over the last 40 years. He discussed the creation of songs like \"Chocolate City\" and \"One Nation Under a Groove\" before doing a Q and A with students in attendance.
