Click here to access the application and instructions.             Since programming is its primary activity, the Program Board may have access to information or other resources not readily available to other student organizations. Co-sponsorships provide the opportunity for the Program Board and other clubs to work together toward the common goal of creating stronger events that a greater number of people can enjoy.

These programs may complement your academic inquiries, or may expose you to a topic or issue outside of your studies. Co-curricular programs often involve Gallatin Faculty members, alumni and outside community members.     Gallatin Community Coffee House     The Coffee House furnishes a space for Gallatin students, faculty, alumni and community members to discuss a charged topic in an unconventional, uncontrolled manner. Each coffee house features a panel comprised of faculty, students and alumni. Past topics have included UnNatural Diasters, Religious Freedom in America, and What is Art? We provide the coffee -- and you provide the conversation.     Dinealogue     This program provides Gallatin students with an opportunity to have a discussion with other students, faculty and external guests on a topic pre-selected by the host. Any member of the Gallatin community may host and submit a proposal for a Dinealogue. Unlike the Coffee House, the size is limited to 15 students. The Office of Student Life has a budget for food and beverages.     Intergroup Dialogue     Intergroup Dialogue is a program co-sponsored by Gallatin, the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development and the Center for Multicultural Programs and Education (CMEP). Intergroup Dialogue Program is a nationally recognized 1-credit course that brings together small groups of students from diverse backgrounds to share their experiences and gain new knowledge related to diversity and social justice. This 8-week course is open to all NYU undergraduate students and takes place in the spring semester only. To learn more about Intergroup Dialogue please visit Intergroup Dialogue CMEP .     Gallatin Sight Seeing     This program exposes Gallatin students to an event, place or institution that is central to New York City through organized programming. Programs include trips to museums, plays, historical sites, etc. The Sight Seeing trips are subsidized by Gallatin and are open to all Gallatin students. Sight Seeing trips are run twice per semester. If you have a suggestion, please stop by the Office of Student Life in room 522 and share your ideas!     Student Start-Ups     This program provides Gallatin students with the resources to initiate a Student Life program. Have an idea for a program that is perfect for Gallatin? Come speak with the Office of Student Life, and we will help to make your idea a reality.     Conversations in Context     In this program, Gallatin faculty discuss hot topics in a conversation that is similar to the way students may talk about their colloquium topics. In other words, a conversation will be held from the perspective of interdisciplinarity, contemporary meaning and historical meaning, providing invaluable insights into colloquium-like conversations.
