Launched in 2005, the MS program was initiated with the generous support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was the second program of its kind, anywhere. It is the first curriculum to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers that offers a graduate program either on a full-time or part-time basis. The program spans four tracks:      Corporate Finance and Financial Markets    Computational Finance    Information Technology and Algorithmic Finance    Risk Finance     The MS program provides students superior training and skills to bridge theory and practice and to engineer the future of finance by providing students with an IT base to understand and meet the challenges in today&rsquo;s cutting-edge financial services industry and its many associated professions.   In addition, the MS program provides students the opportunity to profit from a broad range of educational resources and opportunities at NYU. Furthermore, the Department seeks local and global collaborations with industry on research projects that allow students to apply their existing knowledge and acquire new insights into the ever-changing world of finance.   The MS in Financial Engineering is a well-established program with a diverse curriculum. Our faculty is comprised of leading financial and risk research, adjunct, industry, and research professors, all with extensive practical expertise, who produce world-class research while teaching both introductory and advanced courses in a small class setting.   The program prepares its graduates to enter fast-moving, highly rewarding careers spanning the many occupations prevalent in financial services and related industries. The educational program is continuously updated and adapted to the changing financial environment to augment both the relevance of its content and students&rsquo; career opportunities.   The department supports and conducts faculty and student research, seminars, and other learning activities through its Extreme Risk Initiative, the Topfer Research Chair and other research initiative the department is pursuing with external affiliates. The Department actively participates in comprehensive analysis and assessment of risks in various application areas including financial risk management, derivatives, credit risk, default models in finance, black swans and rare events finance, financial regulation, global-finance, multi-agents finance, behavioral finance and fractional finance, Digital currencies, financial analytics and big data etc. Interdisciplinary financial research relating to global warming, infrastructure and water finance sustainability, financial cyber risks, safety and security, health care, and other topics dependent on important financial considerations are pursued as well. Collaborative research and exchanges are maintained with a large number of internationally recognized professors in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

As an applicant, you are expected to demonstrate your talents and mastery of subject matter to support your application and marshal your best cases for admission to NYU. As a result, NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.   To be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one of the following testing options:     The SAT Reasoning Test; or     The ACT with Writing Test; or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Results from a nationally accredited exam that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education, is administered independently of the student\u2019s school, and has been approved by the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Click here to review our list of approved national examinations .     Redesigned SAT Scores : NYU will accept current and redesigned SAT scores for admission. Applicants may submit scores from either the current SAT or the redesigned SAT (offered beginning spring 2016).                                                  If I have taken multiple examinations that meet NYU's standardized testing requirements, what does NYU recommend I submit to be eligible for admission?                               In the spirit of presenting your best case for admission, choose the examination you feel positions you more favorably and submit only that examination - as long as the results you submit meet our standardized testing requirements. You should only submit multiple test types if you want us to review additional examination results. All examinations are considered equally and you will not be placed at a disadvantage if you do not send SAT/ACT testing.   With regard to the SAT, NYU participates in Score Choice , enabling you to elect which tests you want to send to NYU. If you take the SAT multiple times, we will only review the highest Critical Reading, Math, and Writing scores you submit, regardless of test dates, creating the highest possible composite score for you in our evaluation process.   For the ACT, we will review the highest composite ACT score with Writing, regardless of test dates.                        Subject Requirements:     Students who submit SAT Subject Test, AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB Diploma) must submit:   One literature or humanities score;   One math or science score;   And a score from one test of the student's choice in any subject.

Launched in 2005, the MS program was initiated with the generous support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was the second program of its kind, anywhere. It is the first curriculum to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers that offers a graduate program either on a full-time or part-time basis. The program spans four tracks:      Corporate Finance and Financial Markets    Computational Finance    Information Technology and Algorithmic Finance    Risk Finance     The MS program provides students superior training and skills to bridge theory and practice and to engineer the future of finance by providing students with an IT base to understand and meet the challenges in today&rsquo;s cutting-edge financial services industry and its many associated professions.   In addition, the MS program provides students the opportunity to profit from a broad range of educational resources and opportunities at NYU. Furthermore, the Department seeks local and global collaborations with industry on research projects that allow students to apply their existing knowledge and acquire new insights into the ever-changing world of finance.   The MS in Financial Engineering is a well-established program with a diverse curriculum. Our faculty is comprised of leading financial and risk research, adjunct, industry, and research professors, all with extensive practical expertise, who produce world-class research while teaching both introductory and advanced courses in a small class setting.   The program prepares its graduates to enter fast-moving, highly rewarding careers spanning the many occupations prevalent in financial services and related industries. The educational program is continuously updated and adapted to the changing financial environment to augment both the relevance of its content and students&rsquo; career opportunities.   The department supports and conducts faculty and student research, seminars, and other learning activities through its Extreme Risk Initiative, the Topfer Research Chair and other research initiative the department is pursuing with external affiliates. The Department actively participates in comprehensive analysis and assessment of risks in various application areas including financial risk management, derivatives, credit risk, default models in finance, black swans and rare events finance, financial regulation, global-finance, multi-agents finance, behavioral finance and fractional finance, Digital currencies, financial analytics and big data etc. Interdisciplinary financial research relating to global warming, infrastructure and water finance sustainability, financial cyber risks, safety and security, health care, and other topics dependent on important financial considerations are pursued as well.

As an applicant, you are expected to demonstrate your talents and mastery of subject matter to support your application and marshal your best cases for admission to NYU. As a result, NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.   To be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one of the following testing options:     The SAT Reasoning Test; or     The ACT with Writing Test; or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Results from a nationally accredited exam that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education, is administered independently of the student\u2019s school, and has been approved by the NYU Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Click here to review our list of approved national examinations .     Redesigned SAT Scores : NYU will accept current and redesigned SAT scores for admission. Applicants may submit scores from either the current SAT or the redesigned SAT (offered beginning spring 2016).                                                  If I have taken multiple examinations that meet NYU's standardized testing requirements, what does NYU recommend I submit to be eligible for admission?                               In the spirit of presenting your best case for admission, choose the examination you feel positions you more favorably and submit only that examination - as long as the results you submit meet our standardized testing requirements. You should only submit multiple test types if you want us to review additional examination results. All examinations are considered equally and you will not be placed at a disadvantage if you do not send SAT/ACT testing.   With regard to the SAT, NYU participates in Score Choice , enabling you to elect which tests you want to send to NYU. If you take the SAT multiple times, we will only review the highest Critical Reading, Math, and Writing scores you submit, regardless of test dates, creating the highest possible composite score for you in our evaluation process.   For the ACT, we will review the highest composite ACT score with Writing, regardless of test dates.                        Subject Requirements:     Students who submit SAT Subject Test, AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB Diploma) must submit:   One literature or humanities score;   One math or science score;   And a score from one test of the student's choice in any subject.
