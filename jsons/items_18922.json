Training in 35mm motion picture photography using the Panaflex G2 and the Arriflex 35-3. This class explores lighting and motion picture photography from the perspective of a Director of Photography preparing for a fictional narrative production.

Each student will be given an allotment of 200' of 35mm film (2:10 seconds of screen time) that covers development and print. The means by which a cinematographer reinforces the content of the script MAY be explored depending on the tests that are submitted by the class. Efficiently acquiring coverage for a simple, MOS scene MAY be explored if the class as a whole displays experienced skill handling the lighting and grip equipment.

Learning the nuances of controlling source and shadow in order to create a mood and a feeling will advance the ultimate goal as filmmakers: to tell a good story. In this class you will get practical experience, with the tools and the hardware used in the industry, and you will work through the esthetic decisions every cinematographer must make. But lighting is just part of the story. The heart of cinematography is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement and lens choice, which together with the lighting style will give your films their unique life. Specifically we will learn: the Arri SR2, the Sony EX1 HD camera, essential lighting and grip equipment, color film stocks, hard light vs. soft light, location shooting, color temperature and fluorescent lights, exterior lighting and control of natural light, covering a scene and continuity from a cinematographer's point of view, composition, and camera and actor choreography. In each class, we will look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them, using the elements noted above. We will shoot many excerises with both the film and the HD cameras.
