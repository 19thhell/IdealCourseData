The goal of this course is to prepare the advanced practice nurse to prescribe pharmacotherapies that improve patient care outcomes. The student learns to integrate his/her knowledge of basic pharmacology and pathophysiology with advanced pharmacotherapeutic principles to enhance treatment decisions and prescribe medications for the prevention and treatment of disease. Various methodologies are used to allow the student practice in incorporating patient history, assessment, and diagnoses with consideration of the best, safest, and most effective pharmacotherapeutic options. An emphasis on critical analysis of evidence according to evidence based principles and subsequent application of evidence into the medical and treatment plans is fostered. Critical decision analysis assists the student to evaluate and revise treatment plans to improve patient care.

This course prepares advanced practice nurses to critically apply the study of pathogenesis to health problems across the life span. Pathophysiology is integrated with a developmental perspective to facilitate an in-depth understanding of functional and dysfunctional integration of organ systems in the human. Clinical situations designed to illustrate the concepts discussed are presented during the lecture. Emphasizes content related to neurology, endocrinology, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematology, infectious processes, and neoplasms.
