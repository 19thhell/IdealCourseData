Web site: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~igiddy/restructuring.html     Goals  Corporate restructuring involves any substantial change in a company&#8217;s financial structure, or ownership or control, or business portfolio, designed to increase the value of the firm. This course will be taught around several major topics employing in-depth group work on case studies and deal documentation. The focus will be on identifying situations that call for nonstandard corporate finance solutions, and the design and pricing of the situation-specific financing instruments. Examples of such situations include stress-induced financial restructuring, recapitalizations, private equity and leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, and divestitures. In many cases resolving these issues will require structured finance solutions. Structured finance techniques include the design of debt, equity and hybrid financing techniques in order to resolve particular issuer or investor problems that cannot be solved by conventional methods.    Instructor   Prof. Ian Giddy  is a graduate of the University of Michigan (MBA 1972, PhD 1974) and the University of the Witwatersrand (BSc 1970). He has taught finance at NYU, Columbia, Wharton, Chicago and abroad for the past twenty-five years. He was Director of International Fixed Income Research at Drexel Burnham Lambert from 1986 to 1989. He is the author or co-author of numerous articles and books, including The Handbook of International Finance , The International Money Market , Cases in International Finance , Global Financial Markets ,  Asset Securitization in Asia and The Hudson River Watertrail Guide .     Pedagogy   The course employs cases and problems as well as classroom lectures and discussions, and \"live case studies\" to offer a hands-on learning experience. We will make use of international as well as domestic examples. Each student will be expected to prepare thoroughly and to participate actively in class discussion. Material covered in the assigned readings will generally not be repeated in class. Rather, class time will be devoted to lecture and case discussion, applying the material covered in the readings.     The Course on the Internet   We will make use of the Internet for resource material and communication.
