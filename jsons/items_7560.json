Tuesday, February 10, 2015  12:30 PM - 1:30 PM  1 Washington Pl. (Gallatin Building), Rm. 401        Course Description   Compared to just twenty years ago, most European cities are more diverse and interconnected yet more unequal, more subject to volatile financial investments, and more environmentally vulnerable. Madrid, an important European capital that is struggling to recover from the recent financial crisis, is no exception.   This interdisciplinary urban studies course will introduce students to political and economic changes in Europe while allowing them to explore contemporary history, politics, and urban studies debates. Teachings will draw on a range of approaches, including sociology, anthropology, architecture, and urban planning.   Using case studies from Madrid\u2019s recent history, students will learn about the issues that concern Madrid\u2019s citizens and the ways in which they connect to their city\u2019s broad changes. Students will also learn how Madrid is distinct from as well as typical of the European urban experience.   A significant amount of the course will take place outside the classroom. Site visits will include squatter settlements, immigrant neighborhoods, and the \u201cred belt\u201d of industrial activist suburbs\u2014locations that are not found in tourist guides but are central to understanding Madrid\u2019s recent history.   Weekly reactions, short essays, and a final research paper will allow students to explore their own interests while deepening their knowledge of Madrid. This will serve to provide important contextual knowledge about a city and a country that will likely feature prominently in future partnerships.   Students are required to reside in accommodations arranged by NYU Gallatin.
