Current News/Projects Updated August 2014 I have just returned from a summer of research in Trinidad and London, for my monograph Sacred Sacrilege funded by an NEH summer research grant. Most recently, l've also given a keynote address at the Department of Black Studies, University of California Santa Barbara. I also co-organized with the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies a symposium on \"The Life and Work of Michel-Rolph Trouillot\" (see CLACS website for videotape of conference, March 1, 2013). It was a highly successful event, filling the KJCC auditorium with academics and members of diverse community publics who engaged in spirited dialogs about the many and important legacies of a monumentally important scholar who left us too soon. I also am enjoying, and profiting greatly from my 2012-2013 Humanities Initiative Fellowship, which is giving me valuable time for research, writing/publishing, and engaging with colleagues across the disciplines about our current research projects. I was fortunate to be invited during the spring and fall semesters to give talks at Oxford University, the University of Chicago, The University of the West Indies St. Augustine, and Texas A &amp; M. For the rest of 2012, I presented papers at the Association of Asian American Studies (Seattle), the Caribbean Studies Association (Grenada, W.I.), and the American Anthropological Association (Chicago). I am also delighted, as always, to be engaged with the fascinating research projects of doctoral students here across NYU's College of Arts and Sciences and in several national and international universities.

Current News/Projects Updated August 2014 I have just returned from a summer of research in Trinidad and London, for my monograph Sacred Sacrilege funded by an NEH summer research grant. Most recently, l've also given a keynote address at the Department of Black Studies, University of California Santa Barbara. I also co-organized with the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies a symposium on \"The Life and Work of Michel-Rolph Trouillot\" (see CLACS website for videotape of conference, March 1, 2013). It was a highly successful event, filling the KJCC auditorium with academics and members of diverse community publics who engaged in spirited dialogs about the many and important legacies of a monumentally important scholar who left us too soon. I also am enjoying, and profiting greatly from my 2012-2013 Humanities Initiative Fellowship, which is giving me valuable time for research, writing/publishing, and engaging with colleagues across the disciplines about our current research projects. I was fortunate to be invited during the spring and fall semesters to give talks at Oxford University, the University of Chicago, The University of the West Indies St. Augustine, and Texas A &amp; M. For the rest of 2012, I presented papers at the Association of Asian American Studies (Seattle), the Caribbean Studies Association (Grenada, W.I.), and the American Anthropological Association (Chicago). I am also delighted, as always, to be engaged with the fascinating research projects of doctoral students here across NYU's College of Arts and Sciences and in several national and international universities.
