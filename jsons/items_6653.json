Description       Memory is part of the human condition, and the way it works has long captivated us\u2014and continues to do so in the digital age. In this seminar we consider ways that new technologies change how we remember and by extension, how we forget. Do we remember more now because data can be so easily stored digitally? Or do we forget more because we too readily save information in a way that doesn\u2019t require us to meaningfully process it? What are the ramifications for how we understand history? This course engages critical debates surrounding personal memory as well as cultural memory, in particular with regard to museums, memorials, and archives\u2014all sites that have been, in ways, transformed by digital technology. Even Facebook is altering the way we store and remember aspects of our own lives. This seminar aims to bring crucial awareness to these many aspects through readings, discussion, and writing, culminating in a research paper. Assignments include reaction papers and class trips to memorial sites, and students are encouraged to develop a research topic of their interest. Our syllabus features cultural critics such as Benjamin, Huyssen, and Hirsch, in addition to scholars who focus on the Internet, digital archives, and social media.

Description       Memory is part of the human condition, and the way it works has long captivated us\u2014and continues to do so in the digital age. In this seminar we consider ways that new technologies change how we remember and by extension, how we forget. Do we remember more now because data can be so easily stored digitally? Or do we forget more because we too readily save information in a way that doesn\u2019t require us to meaningfully process it? What are the ramifications for how we understand history? This course engages critical debates surrounding personal memory as well as cultural memory, in particular with regard to museums, memorials, and archives\u2014all sites that have been, in ways, transformed by digital technology. Even Facebook is altering the way we store and remember aspects of our own lives. This seminar aims to bring crucial awareness to these many aspects through readings, discussion, and writing, culminating in a research paper. Assignments include reaction papers and class trips to memorial sites, and students are encouraged to develop a research topic of their interest. Our syllabus features cultural critics such as Benjamin, Huyssen, and Hirsch, in addition to scholars who focus on the Internet, digital archives, and social media.
