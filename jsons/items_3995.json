V29.0200 Drawing on theoretical and philosophical texts by Nietzsche, Bergson,  Adorno, Benjamin, Edward Said, Johannes Fabian, Bakhtin, Elizabeth Grosz, and  Alain Badiou, this course will use theory and literature to explore how certain  works of art come to be epoch-defining, uniquely associated with   their time and place, representative of watershed political  events. Using works of fiction that experiment with temporality and  period, we will explore theoretical categories of temporality and historicity:  decadence, late style, fashion, the outmoded,  the chronotope, the cultural politics of periodization (or the problem of  Eurochronology), and the question of \u201cwhat is a century?\u201d Works studied will  include: Walter Benjamin\u2019s Paris Capital of the Nineteenth-Century and Theses on the Philosophy of History , Jacques Derrida\u2019s Given Time , George  Perec\u2019s Things: A Novel of the 60\u2019s ,  Don DeLillo\u2019s Mao II , W.G.

Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Novel and the City:    Literary Mappings of the Urban Landscape    Bahoora , 4 pts.    V29.0190.001 In the nineteenth century, European literary  narratives increasingly chronicled, through literary descriptions of changing  urban spaces, the material transformations that were a result of modernization.  Narratives of the simplicity and beauty of the countryside were replaced by  depictions of the alienating yet enticing space of the city. In this course, we  will undertake a comparative literary mapping of cities, first exploring  nineteenth century European urban narratives and subsequently expanding our  study to urban narratives of Arab cities. Beginning with paradigmatic novels  characterizing Paris and London , we will focus on the ways that the city  itself becomes a character in the modern novel, the space of the de-centering  and disorienting \u201cprogress\u201d associated with modernity.      After studying these seminal urban narratives, we will  explore how non-European (what some call Third World) cities and spaces have  been narrated through a literary exploration of the role of the city in Arabic  literature. As we move into the literature of the Arab world, we will consider  how discourses on modernization evoke the narratives of European authors, while  simultaneously revealing historically specific circumstances. These include  colonial and postcolonial figurations of space, rural to urban migrations and  the role of the peasant, the constructed binary between tradition and  modernity, uneven development, and increasingly, globalization. We will  historicize the development of these colonial and postcolonial urban spaces  while simultaneously exploring the mapping of the public and private, anonymity  and voyeuristic desires, the crowd, order and disorder, the native and the  European settler/tourist, and the city as the center of consumerism. We will  consider the wa ys that as  literature has given imaginative reality to the city, urban changes in turn  have helped to transform literary texts, producing a symbiotic relationship  between literary and material culture.      Topics in Caribbean Literature: Making of a (Caribbean) Poem    Brathwaite , 4 pts.   V29.0132, V18.0780, V41.0770      Topics in Film and Literature: Reading South by South:    Novel and Film    Dopico , 4 pts.   V29.0300.002, V95.0551.001, V30.0306.002 Reading  comparatively, south by south, this course considers the \u201cidea of the South\u201d as  a real and imagined territory, a potent ideological geography, where regional  mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural imperialism  together produce extraordinary narratives. This course looks to  literature, narrative, and film, to trace a history of ideas and imagination  that predates the urgency of current debates about the global south and the  problem of uneven development. We will be concerned with artists  who know the political imaginary and the fictive qualities assigned to the  South and its subjects. In reading across a wide range of works that  exalts or decries that ideological geography, we will examine how artists  remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and its fictions.      We  will consider works that reflect on different Souths  as both home and destination, and consider how they portray seductive,  dangerous, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures. In texts and films  from Europe and the Americas, we will consider how realities and fantasies of  the South are represented, how a global South becomes a true fiction, and how  writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the realities of uneven development  and to their own barbarous or exotic status.     Readings will focus on the ways in which artists  develop and contest depictions of the South as places where crises over  nationhood and progress take place, and where the social \u201crealities\u201d of the  North cannot hold.      We  will question why writers explore lost worlds, or belatedly return to a  region\u2019s lost history to fictively reinscribe the  past. In so doing, we will explore the exceptional \u201crepresentational  burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how they negotiate their double bind  -- how they engage the biases and appetites of the North and at the same time  respond to the weight of history, self-hatred and loyalty in the South.   In our reading we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives  that \u201cexplain\u201d the South and those who live or pass through it, we will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage  of the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial  traveler, the ressentiment of the  exile, and the collecting and correcting anthropology of the political  and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between  geopolitics and regional mythology, we will  consider the enduring forms of this imaginary and ideological mapping,   how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and neo-colonialism, but  also how it continues to function in the political conflicts and cultural  markets of \u201cglobalization\u201d.      Primary  texts will include many of the following, with some revision:   Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The  Leopard   Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea   Albert Camus, The Stranger   Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralis\u201dt   Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician\u201d   William Faulkner, Go Down Moses, The Sound  and the Fury   Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise Blood ,   The Violent Bear It Away   Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, selections from Mules  and Men   Richard Wright, Black Boy ,  selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children   Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of Carolina   Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps   Juan Rulfo, Pedro P\u00e1ramo   Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One  Hundred Years of Solitude   Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao      Films  will include a selection from Salvatore Giuliano, La terra trema,  El Sur, El Norte, Birth of a Nation, The Emperor Jones, Baby Doll, Suddenly  Last Summer, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Gone With the Wind, Jezebel, The Little Foxes,  To Kill a Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Cool Hand Luke, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,  Mississippi Burning, Slingblade, Hell Has No Limits      Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Island Literature    Ross , 4 pts.   V29.0104 In this course we will examine the island as topos  and literary archetype in a variety of novels, plays, and films. Topics to include islands and western desire; nationalism and  insularity; islands and utopian fantasy; islands, femininity and exoticism.  The first half of the course will focus on canonical western texts (Homer to  Defoe); the second half will examine primarily 20th century cultural production  from the Caribbean. Course readings include The Odyssey (Homer), The Tempest   (Shakespeare), A Tempest (C\u00e9saire), Wide Sargasso Sea   (Rhys), Black Shack Alley (Zobel), and Last of the  African Kings (Cond\u00e9).

By having us follow  16 th -century French author Francois Rabelais into the gullet of his  fabled giant, Auerbach raises questions about the  notion of mimesis as \u201crepresentation of reality.\u201d He also entertains a  multiplicity of worlds interpretable as a challenge to the geographical,  cultural, and linguistic ambit of \u201cWestern Literature.\u201d With the goal of  goading Comparative Literature beyond these limits, we shall pursue Auerbach into Pantagruel\u2019s mouth,  and, with Rabelais inter alia as our companions, we shall travel among  different worlds in order to explore the concept of mimesis through writers of  Europe, the Caribbean and Africa. We shall thereby also attend to alternative  theories of literature that emphasize polyvocality,  and linguistic borrowing and creolization. In  addition to Auerbach and Rabelais, we will be reading  the ancients as well as the moderns, among whom Plato, Montaigne, Bakhtin, Derrida, Chamoiseau,  Coetzee, Mqhayi, and Memela.

How do these languages interact in us, how do they constitute what we are?  The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019 becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen and called. As these languages suggest, we are constituted as desiring subjects in relation to others, but who or what are those others? In this course we will reflect on the relationships between \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019, \u2018subject\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019, \u2018inside\u2019 and \u2018outside\u2019 as imagined in literary works by Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Shakespeare, Racine, Poe, Mallarm\u00e9, Melville, Lorca, Kafka, Borges, Rossetti and writings by Kant, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Althusser, Lacan, Levinas. Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s paintings will bring to view the enigma of our perspective: how are we to define our own viewpoint if our subject of study is no other than ourselves? How can we even be sure the other exists?     Topics in Caribbean Literature Brathwaite Mon/Thurs 9:30-10:45am V29.0132; V18.0780; V41.0770 Study of the literature and society of the Caribbean. Emphasizes the Anglophone Caribbean within a comparative framework of French/Haitian, Spanish, Dutch, and Surinamese Caribbean modes. Topics vary yearly, from a concentration on Caribbean poetry to other cultural forms and presentations. Readings of literature, history, and political theory supplemented with performance, music, film, and video. Subjects include women writers, orality, novels of childhood, and pioneer literary figures.  Reading and Representation in Early Modern Europe Lezra Mon 12:30-3:15pm V29.0162 Is there a distinctively modern way of seeing? Of reading? What sorts of objects are proper to each? Are viewers and readers the same sorts of subjects? How do changes in technology help to shape how we see and read, and in consequence who we are? Pressing for answers to these questions, this seminar tacks between Renaissance painting, philosophy, cartography, anatomy and narrative fiction, treating works by Giotto, Piero della Francesca, D\u00fcrer, Vasari, Vesalius, Cervantes, Descartes, Montaigne and Vel\u00e1zquez. Close attention to theories of perspective (early modern as well as contemporary), embodiment, the gaze, subjectivity, fetishism, and reflection. Additional readings from Freud, Damisch, Panofsky, Lacan, Cassirer, Foucault, Irigaray, Hockney, Mulvey and others. (NOTE: This is an Advanced Honors Course originating in CAS, however it can count as a Comp Lit 'core' course)   Topics in Film and Literature: The Invisible Tradition: Experimental and Clandestine Filmmaking in Barcelona Nadal Wed 12:30-3:15, 4 pts. V29.0300; V95.0951.002 The social and political imaginaries of Francoist Spain created a singular instance of dislocation in the Catalan filmic avant-garde of the 1960s and 70s. This course proposes an examination of the political, historical, and aesthetic conjunctures that allowed the emergence and survival of an often-clandestine experimentalism. The commitment to avant-garde practices, emerging from an established tradition in the Catalan context, pushed the envelope of political possibility by establishing an elective affinity and an affective transfer between the political and the aesthetic. By addressing this productive double enunciation through a transnational lens, this course seeks to shed new light both on European peripheral cinematic avant-gardes and on the historicization of political dissent in Francoist Spain.     Class will be in English. Students from the Spanish Department may do the readings and turn their papers in Spanish (or Catalan!).      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Collective Memory Maps: Spanish Civil War Nadal Tues 3:30-6:10pm 4 pts. V29.0190; V95.0951.003 Over the last ten years the construction of historical memory has taken center stage in the public debates surrounding the legacy of the Spanish Civil War. The concept of the \"lieux de m\u00e9moire\" poses epistemological as well as political questions that are reshaping the protocols of a constitutional nation that had prematurely decided to forget the past, through the so-called \"pacto del olvido\". To this one should add the silence and exile of the past enforced by forty years of Francoist rule. This course will analyze narratives, philosophical and historical texts, archives, films, websites, and other media in order to trace the paradigm shifts of historical memory in contemporary Spain and explore its symbolic capital within European leftist culture. Authors to be to be considered include: Merce Rodoreda, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, Max Aub, Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricoeur, Hanna Arendt, Mar\u00eda Zambrano, Joris Ivens, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Carlos Saura, and Ken Loach, among others.     Readings  and discussions will be in English. Students may do the readings and submit their papers in Spanish.      Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticism Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00- 12:15pm, 4 pts. V29.0104  Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century.  Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism.  Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad).  After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein.  The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution.  We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  List of books (editions still tentative):    Rousseau, The Confessions (Penguin) Goethe, The Sorrows of the Young Werther (Penguin) B\u00fcchner, Lenz (Archipelago)  (plus Woyzeck in pdf.) Goethe, Faust I (Penguin) Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (Norton) Blake\u2019s Poetry and Designs (Norton) Excerpts from Wordsworth\u2019s The Prelude (pdf.) Hugo, Bug-Jargal (Broadview) Bront\u00eb, Wuthering Heights (Norton) Flaubert, Madame Bovary (Norton) Films to be viewed in conjunction with the course: Herzog\u2019s Woyzeck, Branagh\u2019s Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Wyler\u2019s Wuthering Heights, Minelli\u2019s Madame Bovary. Course Requirements: Three papers (7-10pp.).      Enrollment limited to 20. Priority given to Comp. Lit. majors.       Junior Theory Seminar: Literature and Its Others Vatulescu Tues 12:30-3:15pm V29.0200 This seminar will approach the fundamental question of literary theory, \u201cWhat is literature?\u201d through a consideration of literature\u2019s relationship to a diverse cast of others\u2014politics, law, psychoanalysis, and other arts and media. The course will also consider literature\u2019s changing definitions and boundaries by tracking its relationship to extra-literary or \u201clower\u201d genres (some canonized in the meantime, some not) such as novels, letters, and diaries. However, before we learn about literature by observing how it plays with others, we will devote the first section of the course to the foundation of twentieth century literary theory\u2014Russian formalism and its attempts to understand literature on its own terms\u2014a revolutionary move whose theoretical, as well as political consequences we will continue to explore throughout the class.

Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.

Using works of fiction that experiment with temporality and  period, we will explore theoretical categories of temporality and historicity:  decadence, late style, fashion, the outmoded,  the chronotope, the cultural politics of periodization (or the problem of  Eurochronology), and the question of \u201cwhat is a century?\u201d Works studied will  include: Walter Benjamin\u2019s Paris Capital of the Nineteenth-Century and Theses on the Philosophy of History , Jacques Derrida\u2019s Given Time , George  Perec\u2019s Things: A Novel of the 60\u2019s ,  Don DeLillo\u2019s Mao II , W.G.

Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Novel and the City:    Literary Mappings of the Urban Landscape    Bahoora , 4 pts.    V29.0190.001 In the nineteenth century, European literary  narratives increasingly chronicled, through literary descriptions of changing  urban spaces, the material transformations that were a result of modernization.  Narratives of the simplicity and beauty of the countryside were replaced by  depictions of the alienating yet enticing space of the city. In this course, we  will undertake a comparative literary mapping of cities, first exploring  nineteenth century European urban narratives and subsequently expanding our  study to urban narratives of Arab cities. Beginning with paradigmatic novels  characterizing Paris and London , we will focus on the ways that the city  itself becomes a character in the modern novel, the space of the de-centering  and disorienting \u201cprogress\u201d associated with modernity.      After studying these seminal urban narratives, we will  explore how non-European (what some call Third World) cities and spaces have  been narrated through a literary exploration of the role of the city in Arabic  literature. As we move into the literature of the Arab world, we will consider  how discourses on modernization evoke the narratives of European authors, while  simultaneously revealing historically specific circumstances. These include  colonial and postcolonial figurations of space, rural to urban migrations and  the role of the peasant, the constructed binary between tradition and  modernity, uneven development, and increasingly, globalization. We will  historicize the development of these colonial and postcolonial urban spaces  while simultaneously exploring the mapping of the public and private, anonymity  and voyeuristic desires, the crowd, order and disorder, the native and the  European settler/tourist, and the city as the center of consumerism. We will  consider the wa ys that as  literature has given imaginative reality to the city, urban changes in turn  have helped to transform literary texts, producing a symbiotic relationship  between literary and material culture.      Topics in Caribbean Literature: Making of a (Caribbean) Poem    Brathwaite , 4 pts.   V29.0132, V18.0780, V41.0770      Topics in Film and Literature: Reading South by South:    Novel and Film    Dopico , 4 pts.   V29.0300.002, V95.0551.001, V30.0306.002 Reading  comparatively, south by south, this course considers the \u201cidea of the South\u201d as  a real and imagined territory, a potent ideological geography, where regional  mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural imperialism  together produce extraordinary narratives. This course looks to  literature, narrative, and film, to trace a history of ideas and imagination  that predates the urgency of current debates about the global south and the  problem of uneven development. We will be concerned with artists  who know the political imaginary and the fictive qualities assigned to the  South and its subjects. In reading across a wide range of works that  exalts or decries that ideological geography, we will examine how artists  remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and its fictions.      We  will consider works that reflect on different Souths  as both home and destination, and consider how they portray seductive,  dangerous, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures. In texts and films  from Europe and the Americas, we will consider how realities and fantasies of  the South are represented, how a global South becomes a true fiction, and how  writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the realities of uneven development  and to their own barbarous or exotic status.     Readings will focus on the ways in which artists  develop and contest depictions of the South as places where crises over  nationhood and progress take place, and where the social \u201crealities\u201d of the  North cannot hold.      We  will question why writers explore lost worlds, or belatedly return to a  region\u2019s lost history to fictively reinscribe the  past. In so doing, we will explore the exceptional \u201crepresentational  burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how they negotiate their double bind  -- how they engage the biases and appetites of the North and at the same time  respond to the weight of history, self-hatred and loyalty in the South.   In our reading we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives  that \u201cexplain\u201d the South and those who live or pass through it, we will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage  of the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial  traveler, the ressentiment of the  exile, and the collecting and correcting anthropology of the political  and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between  geopolitics and regional mythology, we will  consider the enduring forms of this imaginary and ideological mapping,   how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and neo-colonialism, but  also how it continues to function in the political conflicts and cultural  markets of \u201cglobalization\u201d.      Primary  texts will include many of the following, with some revision:   Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The  Leopard   Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea   Albert Camus, The Stranger   Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralis\u201dt   Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician\u201d   William Faulkner, Go Down Moses, The Sound  and the Fury   Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise Blood ,   The Violent Bear It Away   Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, selections from Mules  and Men   Richard Wright, Black Boy ,  selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children   Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of Carolina   Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps   Juan Rulfo, Pedro P\u00e1ramo   Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One  Hundred Years of Solitude   Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao      Films  will include a selection from Salvatore Giuliano, La terra trema,  El Sur, El Norte, Birth of a Nation, The Emperor Jones, Baby Doll, Suddenly  Last Summer, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Gone With the Wind, Jezebel, The Little Foxes,  To Kill a Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Cool Hand Luke, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,  Mississippi Burning, Slingblade, Hell Has No Limits      Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Island Literature    Ross , 4 pts.   V29.0104 In this course we will examine the island as topos  and literary archetype in a variety of novels, plays, and films. Topics to include islands and western desire; nationalism and  insularity; islands and utopian fantasy; islands, femininity and exoticism.  The first half of the course will focus on canonical western texts (Homer to  Defoe); the second half will examine primarily 20th century cultural production  from the Caribbean. Course readings include The Odyssey (Homer), The Tempest   (Shakespeare), A Tempest (C\u00e9saire), Wide Sargasso Sea   (Rhys), Black Shack Alley (Zobel), and Last of the  African Kings (Cond\u00e9).      Introduction to Comp Lit: Reading &amp; Writing the World    Sanders , 4 pts.   V29.0116.001    Plus Recitation:   V29.0116.002: Fri 9:30-10:45 Armillas-Tiseyra   V29.0116.003: Fri 11:00-12:15 Kramer   V29.0116.004: Fri 8:00-9:15 Piechocki When Erich Auerbach, venerated progenitor of the  Comparative Literature we know, shows us \u201cThe World in Pantagruel\u2019s  Mouth,\u201d he reaches two conceptual limits of his famous work Mimesis: The  Representation of Reality in Western Literature (1946). By having us follow  16 th -century French author Francois Rabelais into the gullet of his  fabled giant, Auerbach raises questions about the  notion of mimesis as \u201crepresentation of reality.\u201d He also entertains a  multiplicity of worlds interpretable as a challenge to the geographical,  cultural, and linguistic ambit of \u201cWestern Literature.\u201d With the goal of  goading Comparative Literature beyond these limits, we shall pursue Auerbach into Pantagruel\u2019s mouth,  and, with Rabelais inter alia as our companions, we shall travel among  different worlds in order to explore the concept of mimesis through writers of  Europe, the Caribbean and Africa. We shall thereby also attend to alternative  theories of literature that emphasize polyvocality,  and linguistic borrowing and creolization. In  addition to Auerbach and Rabelais, we will be reading  the ancients as well as the moderns, among whom Plato, Montaigne, Bakhtin, Derrida, Chamoiseau,  Coetzee, Mqhayi, and Memela.

How do these languages interact in us, how do they constitute what we are?  The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019 becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen and called. As these languages suggest, we are constituted as desiring subjects in relation to others, but who or what are those others? In this course we will reflect on the relationships between \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019, \u2018subject\u2019 and \u2018other\u2019, \u2018inside\u2019 and \u2018outside\u2019 as imagined in literary works by Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Shakespeare, Racine, Poe, Mallarm\u00e9, Melville, Lorca, Kafka, Borges, Rossetti and writings by Kant, Nietzsche, Freud, Heidegger, Althusser, Lacan, Levinas. Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s paintings will bring to view the enigma of our perspective: how are we to define our own viewpoint if our subject of study is no other than ourselves? How can we even be sure the other exists?     Topics in Caribbean Literature Brathwaite Mon/Thurs 9:30-10:45am V29.0132; V18.0780; V41.0770 Study of the literature and society of the Caribbean. Emphasizes the Anglophone Caribbean within a comparative framework of French/Haitian, Spanish, Dutch, and Surinamese Caribbean modes. Topics vary yearly, from a concentration on Caribbean poetry to other cultural forms and presentations. Readings of literature, history, and political theory supplemented with performance, music, film, and video. Subjects include women writers, orality, novels of childhood, and pioneer literary figures.  Reading and Representation in Early Modern Europe Lezra Mon 12:30-3:15pm V29.0162 Is there a distinctively modern way of seeing? Of reading? What sorts of objects are proper to each? Are viewers and readers the same sorts of subjects? How do changes in technology help to shape how we see and read, and in consequence who we are? Pressing for answers to these questions, this seminar tacks between Renaissance painting, philosophy, cartography, anatomy and narrative fiction, treating works by Giotto, Piero della Francesca, D\u00fcrer, Vasari, Vesalius, Cervantes, Descartes, Montaigne and Vel\u00e1zquez. Close attention to theories of perspective (early modern as well as contemporary), embodiment, the gaze, subjectivity, fetishism, and reflection. Additional readings from Freud, Damisch, Panofsky, Lacan, Cassirer, Foucault, Irigaray, Hockney, Mulvey and others. (NOTE: This is an Advanced Honors Course originating in CAS, however it can count as a Comp Lit 'core' course)   Topics in Film and Literature: The Invisible Tradition: Experimental and Clandestine Filmmaking in Barcelona Nadal Wed 12:30-3:15, 4 pts. V29.0300; V95.0951.002 The social and political imaginaries of Francoist Spain created a singular instance of dislocation in the Catalan filmic avant-garde of the 1960s and 70s. This course proposes an examination of the political, historical, and aesthetic conjunctures that allowed the emergence and survival of an often-clandestine experimentalism. The commitment to avant-garde practices, emerging from an established tradition in the Catalan context, pushed the envelope of political possibility by establishing an elective affinity and an affective transfer between the political and the aesthetic. By addressing this productive double enunciation through a transnational lens, this course seeks to shed new light both on European peripheral cinematic avant-gardes and on the historicization of political dissent in Francoist Spain.     Class will be in English. Students from the Spanish Department may do the readings and turn their papers in Spanish (or Catalan!).      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Collective Memory Maps: Spanish Civil War Nadal Tues 3:30-6:10pm 4 pts. V29.0190; V95.0951.003 Over the last ten years the construction of historical memory has taken center stage in the public debates surrounding the legacy of the Spanish Civil War. The concept of the \"lieux de m\u00e9moire\" poses epistemological as well as political questions that are reshaping the protocols of a constitutional nation that had prematurely decided to forget the past, through the so-called \"pacto del olvido\". To this one should add the silence and exile of the past enforced by forty years of Francoist rule. This course will analyze narratives, philosophical and historical texts, archives, films, websites, and other media in order to trace the paradigm shifts of historical memory in contemporary Spain and explore its symbolic capital within European leftist culture. Authors to be to be considered include: Merce Rodoreda, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite, Max Aub, Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricoeur, Hanna Arendt, Mar\u00eda Zambrano, Joris Ivens, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Carlos Saura, and Ken Loach, among others.     Readings  and discussions will be in English. Students may do the readings and submit their papers in Spanish.      Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticism Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00- 12:15pm, 4 pts. V29.0104  Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century.  Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism.  Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad).  After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein.  The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution.  We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  List of books (editions still tentative):    Rousseau, The Confessions (Penguin) Goethe, The Sorrows of the Young Werther (Penguin) B\u00fcchner, Lenz (Archipelago)  (plus Woyzeck in pdf.) Goethe, Faust I (Penguin) Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (Norton) Blake\u2019s Poetry and Designs (Norton) Excerpts from Wordsworth\u2019s The Prelude (pdf.) Hugo, Bug-Jargal (Broadview) Bront\u00eb, Wuthering Heights (Norton) Flaubert, Madame Bovary (Norton) Films to be viewed in conjunction with the course: Herzog\u2019s Woyzeck, Branagh\u2019s Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Wyler\u2019s Wuthering Heights, Minelli\u2019s Madame Bovary. Course Requirements: Three papers (7-10pp.).      Enrollment limited to 20. Priority given to Comp. Lit. majors.       Junior Theory Seminar: Literature and Its Others Vatulescu Tues 12:30-3:15pm V29.0200 This seminar will approach the fundamental question of literary theory, \u201cWhat is literature?\u201d through a consideration of literature\u2019s relationship to a diverse cast of others\u2014politics, law, psychoanalysis, and other arts and media. The course will also consider literature\u2019s changing definitions and boundaries by tracking its relationship to extra-literary or \u201clower\u201d genres (some canonized in the meantime, some not) such as novels, letters, and diaries. However, before we learn about literature by observing how it plays with others, we will devote the first section of the course to the foundation of twentieth century literary theory\u2014Russian formalism and its attempts to understand literature on its own terms\u2014a revolutionary move whose theoretical, as well as political consequences we will continue to explore throughout the class.

Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will explore how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves from one another throughout classical antiquity. Throughout our study we will take gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts construct and portray gender, how gender is deployed as an organizing principle, and how conceptions of gender are thereby developed and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators. All readings will be in translation; students with Greek/Latin are encouraged to refer to the original texts.  Junior Theory Seminar: Modernity  Iampolski   Modernity is a product of Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the culture of modernity. We will start with a founding document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new kinds of violence and social exclusion. The following subjects will be discussed: individual and masses in modern society; violence and modern war; totalitarianism; mechanization of life, alienation, machines; the emergence of subjectivity and the \"loss experience\"; market, capitalism, and many others.  Topics in 20th Century Lit: The Literature of Dictatorship in Spain and Latin America Matos-Martin This course will analyze representations of the traumatic dictatorial histories of Spain and the Southern Cone countries (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay) from a comparative perspective. We will focus on literary and visual sources such as short stories, novels, fiction films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Manuel Rivas, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Luisa Valenzuela, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Isaac Rosa, Mario Benedetti, Eduardo Galeano, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn Villaronga, and Ken Loach. Primary materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Theory of Narrative Sanders Have you wondered how a novel or short story guides you as a reader toward a particular interpretation? How is the meaning of a given work generated by the way in which the work is constructed? This is the central question posed by the theory of narrative. Addressing key narratological topics such as point of view, levels of narration, character and plot, and narrative time, we will read selected realist, modernist, and postmodernist works of growing narrative complexity from across the globe. With works by Balzac, Conrad, Robbe-Grillet, Coetzee, and Wicomb as our primary texts, we will explore how the theory of narrative may usefully complement deconstructive, psychoanalytic, feminist, and postcolonial approaches to reading fictional (and non-fictional) narrative texts. We shall also explore issues of filmic narrative as arise in the adaptation of novels for the screen. Our theoretical works will include writings by Mieke Bal, Roland Barthes, Fredric Jameson, and others.  Evolution of Literary Archetypes: Comparative Romanticisms Sieburth Virginia Woolf once quipped, \u201cOn or about December 1910, human character changed,\u201d but she was probably off by more than a century. Most cultural historians would instead locate this seismic shift in the late eighteenth-century with the emergence of the phenomenon loosely termed Romanticism. Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (posthumously published in 1782) are to our modernity what Augustine\u2019s were to Antiquity and provide the foundational text for what it sometimes called our contemporary Culture of Narcissism. Rousseau\u2019s writings, and in particular his emphasis on the individual\u2019s victimization by society, make possible Goethe\u2019s Storm-and-Stress hero, Werther (who commits suicide) and B\u00fcchner\u2019s Lenz and Woyzeck (both of whom go mad). After exploring these various figures of the Pariah, we will examine the Promethean Overreacher, embodied by Goethe\u2019s Faust and Mary Shelley\u2019s Victor Frankenstein. The social and political ferment that accompanied these emerging archetypes of the Romantic Hero finds its most violent expression in the ideal of Revolution. We will read the American and French Revolutions from the perspectives of Blake ( in his early prophecies), Wordsworth (in selections from The Prelude), and Hugo (in his gothic novel about the Haitian Revolution, Bug-Jargal). The final portion of the semester will be devoted to the Romantic Heroine, as depicted in Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights and Flaubert\u2019s Madame Bovary.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major. The Senior Thesis Seminar must be followed by Independent Study (COLIT-UA 997) to complete the honors thesis.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans Lezra \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.  Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory: Metropolis and World Literature Zhang As an introduction to the concept and discipline of comparative literature, this course examines how modern metropolises in different parts of the world nourish and challenge literary sensibilities, and how modern literature, by treating the city as both its environment and its hero, evolves from realism to modernism and beyond. Our goal is two-fold: On the one hand, and more immediately concerning literature, it seeks to revive Goethe\u2019s notion of Weltliteratur (world literature) in our own time, not by searching for an overarching theme of human experience and culture in which a universal definition of humanity can be reached once and for all, but only by going through different historical, social, and national situations which manifest themselves in terms of cultural and political differences and self-assertions. On the other hand, and regarding a broader interest in the city itself and its representation in the major works of world literature and film, the course is also intended to engage in common issues of our times such as individuality versus community and collectivity; locality versus globality; past versus present, as they are mediated and intensified by urban forms, experiences, and sensibilities. By hopping from city to city, we hope to construct a trajectory of world literature and its world-historical moments of intensity, which is often articulated through the self-images of the great cities. We will be particularly concerned with how the city and literary imagination interact with one another; how the city can be seen as a producer of cultures, subjectivities, diversity, dissent, and unity; and how the urban experience shapes our understanding of time, space, self, and other. The course is also an imagined field trip to some of the major cities on the literary and intellectual map of the modern world. We will visit London in Charles Dickens and T.S. Eliot; Paris in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Flaubert; Dublin in Joyce, Berlin in Water Benjamin; St. Petersburgh in Dostoyevsky and Andre Bely, New York in Dreiser and Fitzgerald, and finally, across the Pacific, Shanghai, and Beijing, the two urban centers that capture the imagination of modern China as they are portrayed in Lao She and Mao Dun, two leading writers of Chinese realist literature. The EuroAmreican and East Asian focus is by no means limiting. There will be a few classes reserved for students who are interested in reading and discussing other cities in other national literary and cultural traditions. Our readings will be centrally literary but some films will be introduced, both as a visual aid and more importantly a different regime of senses and symbolisms entangled with the city. Each class period will be divided into a short lecture and sustained discussions. Students are also expected to do class presentations and act as discussion leaders. Grades will be based on a 1-2 pp weekly journal on the assignment, and a 10pp final paper.
