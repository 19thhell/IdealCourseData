Faculty members are drawn from several departments and institutes of New York University and approach the region from a wide variety of disciplines and perspectives.

Applications for Fall 2015 are due no later than January 4, 2015. Note that the program will only be accepting MA applications for Fall 2015; no fellowships for the doctoral program have been allocated for this admissions cycle, and therefore no applications for the PhD program can be accepted .

Global Liberal Studies      Global Liberal Studies (GLS) is a four year degree program which offers a rigorous course of study in the liberal arts, the hallmark of which is a junior year in residence at one of NYU's international campuses in Africa, Asia, Europe, or Latin America. The curriculum emphasizes great works from around the globe, combining ideas, materials, and methodologies from multiple fields of inquiry, including literature, philosophy, foreign language, and more. Students may begin their freshman year studies at NYU's campus in New York or one of the Liberal Studies campuses in Paris, London, or Florence. The sophomore year in New York reinforces the global perspective infused throughout the core curriculum and prepares students to take full advantage of their junior year overseas. During their year of international study, students will not only begin independent research but also immerse themselves in their chosen international community through internships, community service, or fieldwork. Finally, the senior year in New York combines advanced        course work with a guided individual research project that integrates a truly cosmopolitan four years of study through NYU's global network of campuses and showcases students' understanding of an increasingly interconnected world.
