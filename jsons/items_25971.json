As monitors get larger so do their aspect ratios, the 960 pixel width offers University authors the ability to use more dynamic content and the site viewer more opportunity to view that content. It also changed our design and visual styles.     Design Foundations   The look of the NYU.edu reflects back on previous versions but looks forward to a more Web 2.0 design that is clean and free of too many flourishes, allowing the content to take the spotlight. After all NYU.edu would not exist if it were not for the content and work done at the university.   There was a process of a number of months to investigate the best design to meet all of the targeted needs and audiences. What has evolved is a strong foundation for the next chapter in NYU\u2019s online presence.        Color Palette   You're probably noticed that NYU's primary color is purple. It's a very specifc color of purple, to be exact. The specifics of &quot;NYU purple&quot; and the subsequent primary and secondary color pallettes is what you're going to see all throughout the NYU.edu site:         Official NYU Purple                               HEX: 57068c; CMYK: C85, M100, Y0, K0; RGB: R87, G6, B140           Primary Colors           Color Hex RGB   NYU Purple 57068c 87,6,140  Link Red d11255 209,18,85   Text Black 23241e 35, 36, 30        Secondary Colors           Color Hex RGB   Gray 818790 128, 135, 143  Blue 448ccb 69, 140, 204  Dark Cyan 005b7f 1, 91, 126  Green 0e7d8e 14, 125, 142  Cyan 0077a2 0, 119, 162  Brown 816c5d 130, 108, 94      Content Elements   Fonts   Gotham is the University's official font family and was created and is provided by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones .   The NYU.edu website uses Verdana as its main system font.   Headers   The NYU.edu site uses headers in logical hierarchy (ex: H2 is sub category of H1 and H3 is subcategory of H2 &amp; etc.). There is only one H1 per page as the page title. This H1 is as close to the convention of the page filename as possible to improve search engine optimization.   We have reserved H6 for accessibility (hidden/ off screen).                H1 HEADER         font-size: 37px   font-family: Gotham Book     H2 HEADER   font-size: 24px   font-family: Gotham Book   H3 HEADER   font-size: 19px   font-family: Gotham Medium   H4 HEADER   font-size: 13px   font-weight: bold   font-family: Verdana, Arial   H5 HEADER   font-size: 12px   font-family: Verdana, Arial                       Layout   Web pages always have a dominant element and a number of additional, peripheral elements. On content pages, the dominant element is always situated in the left top corner of a page. This is where the title and primary content is located. Everything else on the page is considered secondary to this main element, but secondary elements also have a hierarchy.   Separate Content: Defining what is &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot;   The informational content on a Web site can have various content types: It can be displayed as text, images, videos, multimedia presentations, audio files, slideshows, or promotions. Within every content type, it is important to separate the \u201cmost important\u201d from the \u201cleast important\u201d \u2013 or in our terms, \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d content \u2013 and classify the hierarchy of importance of what we would like to communicate to the public (site viewer).   Considering the interactive character of the internet and the limited space on the screen, it is important to wisely determine your site\u2019s most important goals when choosing to publish the content.   Main text content can have other related content. For example: photo galleries or videos, interactive forms, or multimedia presentations. It is up to the author to determine what the most important, related content is and its hierarchy within the page.   Making choices is the key to successful layout. Some believe every topic is important and so it may be hard to make these choices. However, they do have to be made, particularly when one subject leads into another, or because it is easier to read from primary to secondary content then reading an undistinguished block of the same size content.           Photography   Photography used on the NYU.edu site must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website.   We recommend using the NYU Photo Bureau for University photography needs to help ensure that you have both the appropriate level of quality and the permission to use images on the University website.        Graphics   While the use of graphics on the NYU.edu website is limited, any graphics used must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website, and must follow guidelines provided in the University Identity and Style Guide .   We recommend using high-quality graphics created by designers rather than line or clip art.         Videos   We recommend that videos on the web are no longer than 2 minutes in length and don't require proprietary software for site viewers to watch. We also strongly recommend that all videos contain captions.     NYU.edu uses the JW Player by LongTail as its local video player.

As monitors get larger so do their aspect ratios, the 960 pixel width offers University authors the ability to use more dynamic content and the site viewer more opportunity to view that content. It also changed our design and visual styles.     Design Foundations   The look of the NYU.edu reflects back on previous versions but looks forward to a more Web 2.0 design that is clean and free of too many flourishes, allowing the content to take the spotlight. After all NYU.edu would not exist if it were not for the content and work done at the university.   There was a process of a number of months to investigate the best design to meet all of the targeted needs and audiences. What has evolved is a strong foundation for the next chapter in NYU\u2019s online presence.        Color Palette   You're probably noticed that NYU's primary color is purple. It's a very specifc color of purple, to be exact. The specifics of &quot;NYU purple&quot; and the subsequent primary and secondary color pallettes is what you're going to see all throughout the NYU.edu site:         Official NYU Purple                               HEX: 57068c; CMYK: C85, M100, Y0, K0; RGB: R87, G6, B140           Primary Colors           Color Hex RGB   NYU Purple 57068c 87,6,140  Link Red d11255 209,18,85   Text Black 23241e 35, 36, 30        Secondary Colors           Color Hex RGB   Gray 818790 128, 135, 143  Blue 448ccb 69, 140, 204  Dark Cyan 005b7f 1, 91, 126  Green 0e7d8e 14, 125, 142  Cyan 0077a2 0, 119, 162  Brown 816c5d 130, 108, 94      Content Elements   Fonts   Gotham is the University's official font family and was created and is provided by Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones .   The NYU.edu website uses Verdana as its main system font.   Headers   The NYU.edu site uses headers in logical hierarchy (ex: H2 is sub category of H1 and H3 is subcategory of H2 &amp; etc.). There is only one H1 per page as the page title. This H1 is as close to the convention of the page filename as possible to improve search engine optimization.   We have reserved H6 for accessibility (hidden/ off screen).                H1 HEADER         font-size: 37px   font-family: Gotham Book     H2 HEADER   font-size: 24px   font-family: Gotham Book   H3 HEADER   font-size: 19px   font-family: Gotham Medium   H4 HEADER   font-size: 13px   font-weight: bold   font-family: Verdana, Arial   H5 HEADER   font-size: 12px   font-family: Verdana, Arial                       Layout   Web pages always have a dominant element and a number of additional, peripheral elements. On content pages, the dominant element is always situated in the left top corner of a page. This is where the title and primary content is located. Everything else on the page is considered secondary to this main element, but secondary elements also have a hierarchy.   Separate Content: Defining what is &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot;   The informational content on a Web site can have various content types: It can be displayed as text, images, videos, multimedia presentations, audio files, slideshows, or promotions. Within every content type, it is important to separate the \u201cmost important\u201d from the \u201cleast important\u201d \u2013 or in our terms, \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d content \u2013 and classify the hierarchy of importance of what we would like to communicate to the public (site viewer).   Considering the interactive character of the internet and the limited space on the screen, it is important to wisely determine your site\u2019s most important goals when choosing to publish the content.   Main text content can have other related content. For example: photo galleries or videos, interactive forms, or multimedia presentations. It is up to the author to determine what the most important, related content is and its hierarchy within the page.   Making choices is the key to successful layout. Some believe every topic is important and so it may be hard to make these choices. However, they do have to be made, particularly when one subject leads into another, or because it is easier to read from primary to secondary content then reading an undistinguished block of the same size content.           Photography   Photography used on the NYU.edu site must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website.   We recommend using the NYU Photo Bureau for University photography needs to help ensure that you have both the appropriate level of quality and the permission to use images on the University website.        Graphics   While the use of graphics on the NYU.edu website is limited, any graphics used must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website, and must follow guidelines provided in the University Identity and Style Guide .   We recommend using high-quality graphics created by designers rather than line or clip art.         Videos   We recommend that videos on the web are no longer than 2 minutes in length and don't require proprietary software for site viewers to watch. We also strongly recommend that all videos contain captions.     NYU.edu uses the JW Player by LongTail as its local video player.

Students initially move through foundational skills in layout, digital rendering and typography, employing industry standard tools and technologies. Additional courses are then taken in more advanced and experimental design utilizing the department&rsquo;s digital imaging, design, and fabrication studios, which are equipped with 2-D and 3-D design software, 3-D printers, laser cutters, and CNC routers. Courses also offer historical and theoretical components and examine current and emerging applications in the fields of design and technology.    Required courses include Introduction to Design I and II (8 points), modular courses which may be taken in any order or concurrently. Followed by Topics in Design courses (8 points). After completing Design I and II, along with one Topics course, a course may be taken outside of the Department of Art &amp; Art Professions to complete the minor. Sample course offerings from NYU Gallatin and NYU School of Engineering are listed below. Courses: ART-UE 401 Introduction to Design I (4 points): This course uses formal exercises of the Bauhaus to teach core digital foundations skills, including software-based design and digital fabrication strategies. Core techniques in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign will be explored, as will modeling strategies using digital sculpting and CAD based tools. Students will be introduced to and will experiment with digital fabrication technologies and techniques across a range of materials and processes. ART-UE 402 Introduction to Design II (4 points): This course provides the basic framework and principles for design across a wide range of media and design fields. Students will be introduced to critical observation and documentation techniques and will learn to conduct design-based research, conceptualize ideas, produce prototypes, and express and present design concepts. The class is primarily studio based though students will also examine the history, theory, and analysis of design and design practices. ART-UE 1430 Topics in Design (4 points): Topics vary from semester to semester and are chosen as a result of both faculty and student interest. Multiple &ldquo;Topics in Design&rdquo; courses will be offered each Fall and Spring semesters. Sample topics: Digital Fabrication This class connects 2D and 3D design processes to the physical world. Through the use of 2D/3D modeling software and additive and subtractive manufacturing processes, including laser cutting, CNC milling, and 3D printing, students will move from design conception to final product. Students will study the emergence of various digital fabrication tools and techniques and will be asked to consider the implications of these technologies on the social, cultural, environmental, and economic worlds. Typography This course serves to introduce the student to the topic of typography, both as letterform design and as a tool for creating larger text based design projects. Typography forms the basis of much of our contemporary communication. Whether a student wants to be a Graphic Designer, an Artist, an Industrial Designer, a FashionDesigner, a Web Designer, an Interactive Designer he/she will need to use typography. By understanding the basic building blocks of typography students will gain the tools to create stronger artwork and design both visually and conceptually.    Fashionable Technology and Wearable Computing In this course, students will study how technology can be used in fashion contexts as a means to complement the functions of the human body and enhance personal expression. The course covers product design, fashion design and prototype production. The course offers a theoretical introduction and foundation, which is iterated through practical course elements in the form of concept development and prototyping. Readings emphasize theoretical discourse on the relationships of the body, technology, fashion, social interactions, and environment. Interaction Design This course will provide students with an understanding of interaction design as an academic and creative discipline. Weekly readings and class discussions will focus on the study of interaction design principles across a variety of media application spaces and contexts. Projects will combine audio, video, imaging, animation, and other media formats and students will be asked to prototype and construct interactive products and systems. Environmental Art and Design Students in this course will use the local urban street as a primary site of ecological analysis, intervention and exhibition. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems. A special focus will be placed on design interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions and infrastructure, and the work of other non human organisms. Color Theory Introduces contemporary color theory and its significance to art and design. A series of exercises using individual subjectivity demonstrates the role of color in personal expression. The interrelatedness of color and meaning is emphasized along with effective graphic and digital communication.    Sample courses offered outside of the Department of Art &amp; Art Professions: DM 1143 Ideation and Prototyping In this class, the creative process will be investigated in order to generate ideas for art, design, technology, and business endeavors. The course will show how ideation, design research and thinking, and prototyping can inspire, inform, and bring depth to what one ultimately creates. Students will expand their arsenal of design research skills, learn how to think critically about their audience, content, form, and processes, as well as, understand the importance of utilizing more than one research and design strategy.    DM 2173 Motion Graphics Studio Motion graphics can be found in a wide range of media: broadcast, web, animation, and film to name a few. This course will allow students to explore the elements of time and space to convey messages and meaning through type, image, and sound for the screen. Individual creativity will be stressed as well as the understanding and use of industry-standard software for developing motion graphics.    DM 4193 Mobile Application Development Today's applications are increasingly mobile. This course teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android or iOS devices, as well as how to deploy them in app stores. The history of mobile computing is also explored.    DM 3153 Media in Game Design and Development This class moves into advanced technological implementations of 2D games. Taking designs from DM 2153 and working in teams, students create a complete game. Students are assigned individually to work in production areas ranging from sprite creation, mapping and level design to engine coding and interaction scripting. Students complete their assignments as if they were members of a professional game- development team.    IDSEM-UG1627 Green Design: From Geddes to Gore Students will explore the designers, cultures, and suppositions about the contemporary environmental movement. Who are the key figures that first ignited the green design revolution and its ensuing agenda? Who effectively promoted maxims such as \"energy crisis,\" \"climate change,\" and \"sustainability?\" Many books, films, projects, and actions contributed to the irresistible success of mainstream eco-values. Which readings initially established the core underpinning of this environmental debate&mdash;Hiroshima by John Hersey, Silent Spring by Rachel Carson, or Ecology of Freedom by Murray Bookchin--and how are they linked today? The class will review architecture and art, and unpack texts by thinkers such as Patrick Geddes, Henry David Thoreau, Ebenezer Howard, John Muir, Louis Sullivan, Ivan Illich, Buckminster Fuller, Sim Van der Ryn, Victor Papanek, Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, William McDonough, Marc Reisner, Jared Diamond, and Al Gore. In tandem, we acutely review seminal designs and works by Antoni Gaudi, Norman Bel Geddes, Bruce Goff, Rudolf Steiner, Samuel Mockbee, and others. The overall objective is twofold: to survey the lager historical context of ecological design and define specific contributions to the green movement.    For further information on Art Minors: Students are encouraged to meet with the Student Services Counselor, Alex Jovanovich, for advisement; it is helpful to bring artwork to this meeting. Students should first check with their major advisor to determine how these minors fit into their undergraduate curriculum.
