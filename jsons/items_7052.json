Were the \u2018Bone Wars\u2019 of the late 19th Century good for the study of paleontology? Is the atomic world deterministic or not? In the study of animal morphology does function dictate form or is it form that dictates function? What is the scale of our universe? These are some of the greatest debates that have gripped the scientific community over the past 350 years. Many of these debates have been restricted to a healthy dialog within the scientific community but on occasion they have sparked lively and even ad homonym exchanges between scientists. In this seminar we will explore the nature of these debates within their appropriate contexts. To grapple with these debates effectively we will need to examine primary and secondary source materials relating to the particular controversy, including biographical materials on their corresponding protagonists. As such, we will be studying works by scientists like: Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke, Georges Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, Thomas Henry Huxley, Samuel Wilberforce, Harlow Shapely, Heber Curtis, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope. Readings will include works by these protagonists as well as supporting secondary source material.

Description       Is light a wave, a particle, or both? Were the \u2018Bone Wars\u2019 controversies of the late nineteenth century good for the study of paleontology? Does quantum physics deny the existence of physical reality? Which is the more powerful driver: nature or nurture? Will the universe continue expanding forever or will it ultimately end in a fiery collapse? Tesla vs. Edison: is AC or DC more likely to cause death by electrocution? These are some of the greatest debates that have gripped the scientific community over the past two hundred and fifty years. Many of these debates have been restricted to a healthy dialogue within the scientific community but on occasion they have sparked lively and even\u00a0 ad hominem \u00a0exchanges between scientists. In this seminar we will explore the nature of these debates within their appropriate contexts. No mathematical or scientific background is necessary; a sincere interest in the subject matter is the only pre-requisite for this seminar. Students will write, workshop and revise three shorter expository essays and a longer literary critical essay. Readings may include works by: Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Thomas Henry Huxley, Samuel Wilberforce, Harlow Shapely, Heber Curtis, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope, Jill Jonnes, Manjit Kumar, Kevin Davies, Brenda Maddox, Edward Lawson, and Tom Rea.

Were the \u2018Bone Wars\u2019 of the late 19th Century good for the study of paleontology? Is the atomic world deterministic or not? In the study of animal morphology does function dictate form or is it form that dictates function? What is the scale of our universe? These are some of the greatest debates that have gripped the scientific community over the past 350 years. Many of these debates have been restricted to a healthy dialog within the scientific community but on occasion they have sparked lively and even ad homonym exchanges between scientists. In this seminar we will explore the nature of these debates within their appropriate contexts. To grapple with these debates effectively we will need to examine primary and secondary source materials relating to the particular controversy, including biographical materials on their corresponding protagonists. As such, we will be studying works by scientists like: Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke, Georges Cuvier, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, Thomas Henry Huxley, Samuel Wilberforce, Harlow Shapely, Heber Curtis, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope. Readings will include works by these protagonists as well as supporting secondary source material.
