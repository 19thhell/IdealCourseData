GPH is not a stand-alone major. NYU\u2019s Global Institute  of Public Health provides CAS students with instructors, advisors, and courses  drawn from the entire University.       The Global Public Health/Science combined major (which includes a Prehealth concentration)  provides a unique opportunity for students to explore cutting-edge science and  how those developments can help address some of the world\u2019s most complex health  challenges. One of three concentrations that a student may select within Global  Public Health/Science is Prehealth. Students will work closely with an advisor  to select the right mix of electives to compliment individual interests and  career paths. Global Public Health/Science graduates will be well prepared to  pursue professional studies in medicine, dentistry, public health, and  nutrition, as well as academic and research positions.      Students will take  required courses in the six core public health areas:     Health &amp; Society in a Global Context     Biostatistics for Public Health     Epidemiology for Global Health Health Policy in a Global World Environmental Health in a Global World Undergraduate Experiential Learning in Global Public Health Students will also take a  set of designated Prehealth courses, and then fill out their coursework with two combined major electives (in Global Public Health and/or Prehealth) and the advanced study of  a foreign language.
