The intellectual enterprise at NYU is characterized by a diversity of viewpoints, including voices of affirmation, of dissent, and of protest; at NYU a voice that is silent elsewhere is heard, and the value of the message is tested on its merit.   Although NYU's undergraduates and graduate students are diverse in background, they also have a lot in common. Each freshman class is full of enthusiastic learners whose goal is to become independent and creatives thinkers with the resourcefulness and social awareness necessary to excel in our constantly changing, increasingly global world.                continued below                                        This content requires the Macromedia Flash Player.

The intellectual enterprise at NYU is characterized by a diversity of viewpoints, including voices of affirmation, of dissent, and of protest; at NYU a voice that is silent elsewhere is heard, and the value of the message is tested on its merit.   Although NYU's undergraduates and graduate students are diverse in background, they also have a lot in common. Each freshman class is full of enthusiastic learners whose goal is to become independent and creatives thinkers with the resourcefulness and social awareness necessary to excel in our constantly changing, increasingly global world.                continued below                                        This content requires the Macromedia Flash Player.

NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.

Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.
