Current Visiting Doctoral Researchers   Academic Year 2013-2014       Roxana Banu  Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Toronto   Roxana Banu is an SJD candidate at the University of Toronto. Prior to commencing her SJD, she completed an LL.M. in International Bussiness and Trade Law at Fordham Law School in NY, with magna cum laudae, being awarded the Edward J. and Elizabeth V. Hawk Prize for the highest cumulative grade. Her first law degree was obtained in Germany at the Freie Universitaet Berlin, where she was awarded the DAAD Prize for outstanding results of a foreign student.   Roxana taught a seminar in Private International Law as one of the inaugural teaching fellows at Fordham Law School in 2010 and the Conflict of Laws course at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University (Toronto) as an Adjunct Faculty in 2012.   Her doctoral thesis sets up an analytical framework, which considers the interplay of four policy directions in the various Private International Law theories and methodologies: individualism, state-centrism, universalism and particularism. The aim of the framework is to better understand how different Private International Law theories manage or fail to conceptualize the various facets of inter-human legal relations in a globalized world, by underscoring one or several of the four policy directions. Through an analysis of Private International Law scholarship between the mid 19 th to the mid 20 th century, the thesis uncovers individualistic universalist perspectives which might prove useful when analyzing and attempting to offer solutions for various global governance concerns, including the extraterritorial tortious activities of multinational corporations, or the private and public law components of family relations in an international setting.       Maria Adele Carrai   Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Hong Kong   Maria Adele Carrai is a Ph.D. Fellow in Law and Swire Scholar at the University of Hong Kong, working under the supervision of Professor Albert Chen Hung-yee.   She holds a MA in Political Science from the University of Bologna, a MA in Asian Languages, Economics and Legal Institutions from Ca\u2019Foscari University of Venice, and a BA in Chinese Language and Culture from the University of Rome La Sapienza.   The topic of her Ph.D. research is \u201cState and Empire: China\u2019s World Views and Discourses of Sovereignty, From the Early Translation of Sovereignty to its Present Status as a Concept,\u201d in which she is studying the genealogy of the concept of sovereignty in China, from its systematic translation in the mid-19 th century to its present problematic use. Her general research interests include Western and Chinese legal and political philosophy, legal history, and international law and relations.         Stef Feyen  Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Belgium   Stef Feyen is a research fellow of the Flemish Research Foundation. He is a PhD researcher at with the Institute of Constitutional Law at Leuven University, and affiliated as promovendus with the Ius Commune Research School at Maastricht University. Stef\u2019s research interests include constitutional law, judicial politics and legal theory, all broadly conceived.   Under supervision of Andr\u00e9 Alen, President of the Belgian Constitutional Court, he is writing a dissertation about interpretation and application of law by several European constitutional courts. More concretely, he is investigating whether, and if so, how and to which extent French, German and Belgian scholars who reflect on interpretation and application of the constitution have faced the challenges posed by \u201crealist\u201d thought.   Stef holds a master\u2019s degree in law, as well as one in political science, both from the University of Leuven (both 2009). Next to that, he obtained an LL.M. degree from Harvard University (2010). He served as a law clerk at the Belgian Constitutional Court, and interned at Stibbe in Brussels. Stef published several articles in both Belgian and international journals, covering a range of topics including federalism, judicial politics and European Union law, some of which won awards. He furthermore published a book in 2013 ( Beyond Federal Dogmatics ) which was conceived as a preliminary study for his dissertation.       Zsuzsanna Gedeon  Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Hungary   Zsuzsanna Gedeon is an SJD candidate at Central European University in comparative constitutional law. She is working under the supervision of Professor Renata Uitz. Her main interests include political and legal philosophy, constitutionalism, separation of powers and the relationship between politics and law. Her dissertation is focusing on the limits on the fused executive and legislative powers in the US, France, the UK and Hungary. During her research at NYU she will continue to examine particular cases from the perspectives of the liberal, conservative and republican intellectual traditions.   Before joining the SJD program, Zsuzsanna graduated from the Faculty of Law at ELTE in Budapest, in 2010. She obtained her LLM degree in Comparative Constitutional Law from Central European University in 2011. The same year she was accepted to the SJD program at CEU. She was a Visiting Researcher at Georgetown University for three months in 2014. Zsuzsanna was awarded the Fulbright scholarship for the 2014/2015 academic year.       Bartosz Krzysztof Marciniak  Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Poland   Bartosz Krzysztof Marciniak is a Polish Ph.D. candidate at the European University Institute. He is conducting a research project which regards boundaries of legitimate constitutional authority, under the supervision of professors Mattias Kumm and Giovanni Sartor. The project\u2019s starting point is a recent practice of some Supreme and Constitutional Courts; these courts establish the unconstitutionality of constitutional amendments and laws on the grounds of their infringing upon \u2018the essence of the liberal democratic state governed by the rule of law\u2019. Courts do so even if the values and principles infringed are not enshrined within a constitution. Ultimately, the aim of the project is to determine whether one can speak of only one source of legitimate law - the so-called \u2018core of constitutionalism\u2019, the contents of which are beyond the reach of le pouvoir constituent .       Bartosz received his master\u2019s in Law from University of Warsaw (2010), a master\u2019s degree in Classics from University of Warsaw (2011) and an LLM degree from the European University Institute (2013). During his academic career, before being offered a position of Ph.D. researcher at the EUI, he studied law for one year at Federico II University of Naples, Faculty of Law (2008-09). He was twice a grantee of the Italian Government in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 he conducted research on the Italian constitutional jurisprudence (the position of Constitutional Court within the Italian legal system) at the University of Catania, Faculty of Law. In 2011 he conducted research on Roman law (the way Roman law was taught in antiquity) at Frederic II University of Naples, Faculty of Law. He worked as a law clerk in the Bureau of the Polish Ombudsman (XII Commission for Constitutional Affairs) and in the Legal Office of the Ministry of Polish Culture and Heritage.

Current Visiting Doctoral Researchers   Academic Year 2013-2014       Roxana Banu  Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Toronto   Roxana Banu is an SJD candidate at the University of Toronto. Prior to commencing her SJD, she completed an LL.M. in International Bussiness and Trade Law at Fordham Law School in NY, with magna cum laudae, being awarded the Edward J. and Elizabeth V. Hawk Prize for the highest cumulative grade. Her first law degree was obtained in Germany at the Freie Universitaet Berlin, where she was awarded the DAAD Prize for outstanding results of a foreign student.   Roxana taught a seminar in Private International Law as one of the inaugural teaching fellows at Fordham Law School in 2010 and the Conflict of Laws course at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University (Toronto) as an Adjunct Faculty in 2012.   Her doctoral thesis sets up an analytical framework, which considers the interplay of four policy directions in the various Private International Law theories and methodologies: individualism, state-centrism, universalism and particularism. The aim of the framework is to better understand how different Private International Law theories manage or fail to conceptualize the various facets of inter-human legal relations in a globalized world, by underscoring one or several of the four policy directions. Through an analysis of Private International Law scholarship between the mid 19 th to the mid 20 th century, the thesis uncovers individualistic universalist perspectives which might prove useful when analyzing and attempting to offer solutions for various global governance concerns, including the extraterritorial tortious activities of multinational corporations, or the private and public law components of family relations in an international setting.       Maria Adele Carrai   Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Hong Kong   Maria Adele Carrai is a Ph.D. Fellow in Law and Swire Scholar at the University of Hong Kong, working under the supervision of Professor Albert Chen Hung-yee.

Stef Feyen  Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Belgium   Stef Feyen is a research fellow of the Flemish Research Foundation. He is a PhD researcher at with the Institute of Constitutional Law at Leuven University, and affiliated as promovendus with the Ius Commune Research School at Maastricht University. Stef\u2019s research interests include constitutional law, judicial politics and legal theory, all broadly conceived.   Under supervision of Andr\u00e9 Alen, President of the Belgian Constitutional Court, he is writing a dissertation about interpretation and application of law by several European constitutional courts. More concretely, he is investigating whether, and if so, how and to which extent French, German and Belgian scholars who reflect on interpretation and application of the constitution have faced the challenges posed by \u201crealist\u201d thought.   Stef holds a master\u2019s degree in law, as well as one in political science, both from the University of Leuven (both 2009). Next to that, he obtained an LL.M. degree from Harvard University (2010). He served as a law clerk at the Belgian Constitutional Court, and interned at Stibbe in Brussels. Stef published several articles in both Belgian and international journals, covering a range of topics including federalism, judicial politics and European Union law, some of which won awards.

Before joining the SJD program, Zsuzsanna graduated from the Faculty of Law at ELTE in Budapest, in 2010. She obtained her LLM degree in Comparative Constitutional Law from Central European University in 2011. The same year she was accepted to the SJD program at CEU. She was a Visiting Researcher at Georgetown University for three months in 2014. Zsuzsanna was awarded the Fulbright scholarship for the 2014/2015 academic year.       Bartosz Krzysztof Marciniak  Visiting Doctoral Researcher  Poland   Bartosz Krzysztof Marciniak is a Polish Ph.D. candidate at the European University Institute. He is conducting a research project which regards boundaries of legitimate constitutional authority, under the supervision of professors Mattias Kumm and Giovanni Sartor. The project\u2019s starting point is a recent practice of some Supreme and Constitutional Courts; these courts establish the unconstitutionality of constitutional amendments and laws on the grounds of their infringing upon \u2018the essence of the liberal democratic state governed by the rule of law\u2019. Courts do so even if the values and principles infringed are not enshrined within a constitution. Ultimately, the aim of the project is to determine whether one can speak of only one source of legitimate law - the so-called \u2018core of constitutionalism\u2019, the contents of which are beyond the reach of le pouvoir constituent .       Bartosz received his master\u2019s in Law from University of Warsaw (2010), a master\u2019s degree in Classics from University of Warsaw (2011) and an LLM degree from the European University Institute (2013). During his academic career, before being offered a position of Ph.D. researcher at the EUI, he studied law for one year at Federico II University of Naples, Faculty of Law (2008-09). He was twice a grantee of the Italian Government in 2010 and 2011. In 2010 he conducted research on the Italian constitutional jurisprudence (the position of Constitutional Court within the Italian legal system) at the University of Catania, Faculty of Law. In 2011 he conducted research on Roman law (the way Roman law was taught in antiquity) at Frederic II University of Naples, Faculty of Law. He worked as a law clerk in the Bureau of the Polish Ombudsman (XII Commission for Constitutional Affairs) and in the Legal Office of the Ministry of Polish Culture and Heritage.
