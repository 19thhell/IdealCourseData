Their study included site visits to venues such as NYU, BAM, MoMA, Lincoln Center, the Dutch Consulate, Signature Theatre, and the Park Avenue Armory. They were able to hear from leaders at each venue about their varied histories of service through the arts to the New York and world communities.    This kind of service by NYU Steinhardt&rsquo;s Arts Administration Programs exhibits the growing international nature of arts management studies worldwide. The global initiative was hosted by Professor Carlo Lamagna, Senior Faculty of the Visual Arts Administration Program, Professor Alan Salzenstein, President of the Association of Arts Administration Educators, and Professor Brann J. Wry, Director of the Performing Arts Administration Program. Read more about the International Study Tour here .    Featured Courses    Creating Exhibitions in the Curatorial Practice course!    The VAA MA Program students in the Spring 2013 Curatorial Practice course were divided into three working groups. One group met with the department BFA students in their studios at 383 Lafayette Street in order to get to know their work. They organized an exhibition, The Poetics of Translation, installed on the 8th floor of NYU&rsquo;s Kimmel Center, which keyed off some of the themes that the BFA students have been working on this year. Another group from the Curatorial Practice course organized a six month exhibition at Takasago Corporation in midtown around the theme of wood (Takasago is a perfume company) &ndash; Takasago will be hosting a reception for the MFA students and studio faculty whose work is in this exhibition, and they want the artists and arts administrators to come and meet the perfumers. The third group in the Curatorial Practice course worked on organizing and mounting an exhibition at Maccarone Gallery (630 Greenwich Street below Chelsea) of the archival works of James Lee Byars, a prominent American conceptual artist. This exhibition, I Can&rsquo;t Stand to Look at the Earth, ran from June 7&ndash;July 19, 2013. Through these three projects, the Visual Arts Administration students in the Curatorial Practice course were able to apply theoretical classroom discussions about curating to actually organizing exhibitions. By using three different venues, the class was able to understand the various aspects of creating exhibitions for three very different spaces and select appropriate artwork from the studio artists in our department as well as work with the archives of an older artist.    In the Spring 2014 semester, the Curatorial Practice class will partner with the department's 80WSE Gallery to organize an exhibition and public programs that focus on the work of Delta blues singer and folk artist James \"Son Ford\" Thomas. The exhibition will be on view Summer 2014.    Learn how to Speak up for the Arts Arts Advocacy: Concept and Practice Arts organizations rely on the support and sponsorship of public and private agencies and individuals. This course focuses on current issues and approaches to public understanding and legislative support for the arts, and examines the context and growth of arts advocacy in the United States. Students develop hands-on skills to initiate and sustain effective relationships with policy makers and other arts stakeholders. Course session topics include: determining the value of the arts, arts funding as a market of cultural attitudes, the arts as an economic engine, political structures and lobbying, censorship and the arts, consortia and coalition building, advocacy through and for arts education, media advocacy and cultural diplomacy . Connecting the Past to New Audiences    Cultural Heritage Professor Carlo Lamagna has launched a new course on the principles, practices and interpretation of cultural heritage. his is a dynamic field that constantly requires reinvention of methods for identifying, preserving and analyzing heritage so that the voices of multiple stakeholders are acknowledged and heard, and a diverse audience is cultivated and engaged. The course examines the development of cultural heritage as a discipline or set of disciplines, including issues of advocacy, preservation, meaning making through heritage and heritage interpretation. A global perspective is incorporated with a focus on New York cultural organizations such as the South Street Seaport Museum, the New York Historical Society, the Tenement Museum, the Museum of Jewish Heritage, among others, for site visits.  Rethinking Arts Education in a Community Context    Contemporary Art and Community Museums In this fall course taught by Professor Rachleff Burtt students investigate interpretive strategies, including curatorial research, social justice theory, object-based interpretation and the broader cultural context surrounding contemporary art and local community audiences. Through critical reading and discussion students situate themselves into practitioner debates about museums as a site for cultural dialogues. The course partner for 2011 and 2012 was the Bronx Museum of the Arts. Students are required to observe programs at the museum and at other Bronx-based organizations throughout the semester and develop a proposal for a specific community art education project for the Museum. Praxis in Contemporary Art and Community Museums is the laboratory component of this course, given in the spring semester.  Strategic Planning Fair    Strategic Planning and Governance in the Visual Arts Midway through this course, also taught by Professor Rachleff Burtt, students are assigned to work in teams of three on a case study for a given organization. Each assignment is an actual challenge/problem facing a visual arts organization. Applying art history, theory/criticism, arts management, economic development, and educational assessment methodologies (which include the development of a survey,) students develop a plan to resolve their organization&rsquo;s challenge. The projects culminate in a Strategic Planning Fair at the end of the semester where students exchange information with their partnering organization and other organizations participating. Partners have included: Apex Art, Art in General, Artist Alliance/Cuchfritos Gallery, Bronx Museum of the Arts, Brooklyn Historical Society, Exit Art, Fourth Arts Block, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Museum of Biblical Art, Queens Museum of the Arts and South Street Seaport Museum, among others.

Connecting the Past to New Audiences    Cultural Heritage Professor Carlo Lamagna has launched a new course on the principles, practices and interpretation of cultural heritage. his is a dynamic field that constantly requires reinvention of methods for identifying, preserving and analyzing heritage so that the voices of multiple stakeholders are acknowledged and heard, and a diverse audience is cultivated and engaged. The course examines the development of cultural heritage as a discipline or set of disciplines, including issues of advocacy, preservation, meaning making through heritage and heritage interpretation. A global perspective is incorporated with a focus on New York cultural organizations such as the South Street Seaport Museum, the New York Historical Society, the Tenement Museum, the Museum of Jewish Heritage, among others, for site visits.  Rethinking Arts Education in a Community Context    Contemporary Art and Community Museums In this fall course taught by Professor Rachleff Burtt students investigate interpretive strategies, including curatorial research, social justice theory, object-based interpretation and the broader cultural context surrounding contemporary art and local community audiences. Through critical reading and discussion students situate themselves into practitioner debates about museums as a site for cultural dialogues. The course partner for 2011 and 2012 was the Bronx Museum of the Arts. Students are required to observe programs at the museum and at other Bronx-based organizations throughout the semester and develop a proposal for a specific community art education project for the Museum. Praxis in Contemporary Art and Community Museums is the laboratory component of this course, given in the spring semester.  Strategic Planning Fair    Strategic Planning and Governance in the Visual Arts Midway through this course, also taught by Professor Rachleff Burtt, students are assigned to work in teams of three on a case study for a given organization. Each assignment is an actual challenge/problem facing a visual arts organization. Applying art history, theory/criticism, arts management, economic development, and educational assessment methodologies (which include the development of a survey,) students develop a plan to resolve their organization&rsquo;s challenge. The projects culminate in a Strategic Planning Fair at the end of the semester where students exchange information with their partnering organization and other organizations participating. Partners have included: Apex Art, Art in General, Artist Alliance/Cuchfritos Gallery, Bronx Museum of the Arts, Brooklyn Historical Society, Exit Art, Fourth Arts Block, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Museum of Biblical Art, Queens Museum of the Arts and South Street Seaport Museum, among others.

Taking into account the cultural and economic impact of the visual arts, nationally and internationally, as well as the challenges facing the arts today, the program prepares students to become leaders in a broad range of arts organizations. The Visual Arts Administration MA program addresses the whole art ecology, including the cultural environment in which art and arts organizations operate; the role of the artist in society; how artwork is documented, presented and interpreted; the structure and management of organizations that display artwork &ndash; both non-profit and for-profit; and the role of art theorists, critics, curators, and collectors. The program curriculum also considers how education in arts organizations expands knowledge and builds audiences, the increasing role of art in urban development and public spaces, and new approaches and tools for encouraging access and participation. A strong emphasis is placed on acquiring the theoretical and practical tools for fundraising, financial management, marketing and knowledge of new media and technology in the visual arts. While the program is primarily oriented toward the non-profit segment of the field, it also offers a strong for-profit concentration. Emphasis is placed on collaboration across the visual arts administration field. The program takes advantage of its position in New York City to utilize the variety of arts organizations and professionals available through case studies, focus groups, site visits and examples of theory applied to practice. Using the program's extensive internship and alumni networks allows students access to a wide range of individuals and organizations in the field and increases the depth of their understanding of the complexities of this challenging area. Since its beginnings, the program has taken an extensive and integrated international outlook. The curriculum fosters a global perspective within course readings and discussions, and through several study abroad options. In London, for example, students analyze the exhibition and display of art in material culture through a dynamic curriculum that blends classroom sessions and site visits. In the Netherlands and Berlin, Performing Arts Administration and Visual Arts Administration students compare and contrast the management of cultural institutions in the U.S. and Europe, with an emphasis on cultural policy, cultural diplomacy, funding mechanisms, globalism and mobility, and cultural identity and diversity.    Student Learning Outcomes    Upon completion of our program, our students will:       Demonstrate an understanding of the creative process, how art and artists function in society    Analyze the economic, political and social environment in which artists and arts organizations operate, including legal, ethical and policy issues    Identify and evaluate how artwork is interpreted, presented, documented and archived    Critique and compare the structure, operations and management of organizations that present or produce artwork on various scales    Outline strategies for marketing, audience development, outreach and community development in the arts    Acquire business skills in accounting, finance, organizational theory and management as well as arts-related media and technology    Develop an expansive and inclusive world view of the field that values different global perspectives, identities, concerns and goals       For More Information    Grad Info Night Wednesday, October 29 6-8 pm 34 Stuyvesant Street Please RSVP .
