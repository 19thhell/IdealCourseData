A growing scholarship in film and media studies has identified the phenomenon within the rubric of \u201cnew independent cinema\u201d in Asia, focusing on the roles of new media and digital technologies in enabling new modes of production and the filmmakers\u2019 transnational trajectories in the global festival circuit. However, further exchanges of frameworks and experiences across the region are needed as we delve into the following questions: What keywords and concepts are useful to understand contemporary film and media practices in Asia and help us rethink pre-existing notions such as \u201cindependent film,\u201d \u201cAsian cinema,\u201d or \u201ctransnational cinema\u201d? How do we view film and media initiatives as social practice integral to local cultural networks, social movements, and political discourses, and what kinds of cultural and political interventions have been made? How have these new practices contributed to the representation of gender, sexuality, race, class, ethnicity, and religion? This workshop aims to foster dialogues between film and media scholars, practitioners, and activists from East and Southeast Asia to explore parallels, intersections, and future collaborations in the Trans-Asian context.

A growing scholarship in film and media studies has identified the phenomenon within the rubric of \u201cnew independent cinema\u201d in Asia, focusing on the roles of new media and digital technologies in enabling new modes of production and the filmmakers\u2019 transnational trajectories in the global festival circuit. However, further exchanges of frameworks and experiences across the region are needed as we delve into the following questions: What keywords and concepts are useful to understand contemporary film and media practices in Asia and help us rethink pre-existing notions such as \u201cindependent film,\u201d \u201cAsian cinema,\u201d or \u201ctransnational cinema\u201d? How do we view film and media initiatives as social practice integral to local cultural networks, social movements, and political discourses, and what kinds of cultural and political interventions have been made? How have these new practices contributed to the representation of gender, sexuality, race, class, ethnicity, and religion? This workshop aims to foster dialogues between film and media scholars, practitioners, and activists from East and Southeast Asia to explore parallels, intersections, and future collaborations in the Trans-Asian context.

Friday, May 1 7:30-9:30pm Screening: Independencia (The Philippines, 2009; dir. Raya Martin; 77 min.) Introduced by Luke Moses (NYU) Film description Independencia (Philippines, 2009, 77 min), a film by acclaimed director Raya Martin, was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Set in the Philippines during the start of the American Occupation in the early 1900s, the film revolves around three generations of a family who flees the conflict in the city and tries to survive in the jungle. The visual style of Independencia evokes the mode of filmmaking during the era and serves as a metaphor for the mythical history and identity of the Philippines. About the filmmaker Raya Martin, born in Manila, 1984, makes fictional features, documentaries, shorts, and installations. Some of his well-known films are How to Disappear Completely (2013), Independencia (2009), and Autohystoria (2007).

Asian Film and Media BA minor  New to the Department of Cinema Studies! Asian Film and Media BA minor  In response to increasing interest and demand in courses related to film and media in Asia and its diaspora, the new minor allows students to focus on and pursue in depth studies of both historical and contemporary formations of Asian film and media. The current BA in Cinema Studies introduces students to the history, theory, and aesthetics of film and the moving image. Though the existing curriculum is generally international in scope, there is no identifiable focus on the Asia-Pacific region and the Asian diaspora. The new program will complement the existing Cinema Studies BA major and minor. There is no other school or department that currently offers a comparable program. By consolidating faculty resources and relevant course offerings in TSOA and NYU as a whole, the new minor will attract students from other schools and departments to gain exposure to cinema and media studies through a focused study of Asia and its diaspora. Cinema Studies majors may elect to focus on this area of studies as an informal concentration. The program, an integral part of the Asian Film and Media Initiative involving teaching, learning, research and public outreach, will contribute to the consolidation and expansion of the community of NYU faculty and students interested in Asian film and media. The program faculty include full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty from TSOA, Steinhardt, and CAS, and more will join as the program evolves and grows. Course requirements, sequencing, credits Four courses including one introductory film course (Language of Film, Expressive Culture: Film or Intro to Film) and one core Asian Film and Media course are required, 16 credits in total. The introductory film course is the prerequisite to all other courses. The core course should be taken the first year the minor is declared. Sample courses Asian Film History and Historiography (core); Asian Media and Popular Culture (core); Indian Cinemas; Korean Cinema; Asian-American Cinema; Chinese Cinemas Japanese Anime and New Media; South Asian Media Cultures.
