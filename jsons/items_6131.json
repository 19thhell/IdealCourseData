Current News/Projects                            Updated August 2014 I am an evolutionary morphologist and paleoanthropologist with   primary research interests in the evolution of positional behavior   (posture and locomotion) during human evolution. My research focus is   not on a particular time period; rather, I am   interested in evolutionary transitions in the hominoid fossil record,   from 20 million-year-old extinct apes to modern human and ape variation   and the entirety of human evolution in between. The major focus of my   academic work has been on the primate postcranial skeleton and   specifically the vertebral column (spine). I have worked to describe and   analyze in a large comparative dataset the vertebral column of a new   species of early hominin, Australopithecus sediba . Late last   year, I was part of a team that excavated and cataloged a large number   of hominin fossils at Rising Star Cave in the Cradle of Humankind, South   Africa. I worked with an international team of researchers this summer   to describe what is likely a new and surprising species of hominin that   will undoubtedly alter the way we think about human evolution.      I continue to teach undergraduate courses like Human   Evolution, Human Origins, Problems and Perspectives in Human Evolution,   and Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior, along with graduate courses   like Interpreting Human Skeletal Morphology and Integrative   Paleoanthropology I. I hope to offer new graduate and undergraduate   courses in the future. I have also been invited to give talks, both   internally at NYU (Evening Evolution Group, Center for Genomics and   Systems Biology) and at other universities (Yale, Stony Brook, and   CUNY). In 2012 and 2013, I served on the American Association of   Physical Anthropologists Program Committee, and, since January 2014 I   have served as Associate Editor at the Journal of Human Evolution. I am   also a contributor to the Encyclopedia of Human Evolution (B.A. Wood, ed. 2013 and online).    In addition to continuing PhD students, Cody Prang and Jenny Eyre,   Dr. Gabrielle Russo worked with me as a post-doctoral researcher in the   Spring of 2014. We are currently finalizing several research projects on   fossil hominin vertebrae and a comparative study of the ursid (bear)   vertebral column, with implications for the evolution of convergent   traits in hominoids (apes). This fall, Alex DeCasien joins the PhD   program to work with me and Dr. James Higham on skeletal correlates of   sexual selection.

A major feature of developmental networks is their robustness (Masel &amp; Siegal 2009). That is, they are tolerant of both environmental and genetic perturbations. Our lab uses both experimental and computational approaches to understand the causes and evolutionary consequences of this robustness.          One major experimental focus in our lab is on the process of sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster and related flies. Sexual differentiation is a powerful model system for studying the evolution of development because many aspects of sexual morphology, physiology and behavior differ between closely related species, thereby enabling high-resolution comparative analysis. Despite this rapid divergence, sexual traits are highly robust within species and indeed are often diagnostic of species. We are using genomic and genetic approaches to identify and characterize regulatory pathways involved in genital development and function in D. melanogaster (e.g., Chatterjee et al. 2011). This will lay the groundwork for determining how these robust pathways diverged between closely related species.       A second major experimental focus is on directly identifying and characterizing genes that contribute to robustness of many traits. We have screened the genome of the laboratory yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for genes whose deletion increases the variation in the morphologies of individual, genetically identical cells. Yeast is advantageous for this work because of its wealth of genetic and genomic resources, and because it lends itself to high-throughput analyses. Hundreds of yeast genes increase morphological variation when deleted, and these genes tend to be highly connected in cellular networks (Levy &amp; Siegal 2008). We are currently testing whether the same genes also buffer genetic differences between cells, and whether the variation that is revealed by impairment of these genes is potentially beneficial. This work is complemented by theoretical investigations into the evolution of complex gene networks (e.g., Bergman &amp; Siegal 2003; Siegal et al. 2007), as well as bioinformatic analyses of regulatory networks (e.g., Chen et al. 2010), which give us predictions to test experimentally.

Current News/Projects                            Updated August 2014 I am an evolutionary morphologist and paleoanthropologist with   primary research interests in the evolution of positional behavior   (posture and locomotion) during human evolution. My research focus is   not on a particular time period; rather, I am   interested in evolutionary transitions in the hominoid fossil record,   from 20 million-year-old extinct apes to modern human and ape variation   and the entirety of human evolution in between. The major focus of my   academic work has been on the primate postcranial skeleton and   specifically the vertebral column (spine). I have worked to describe and   analyze in a large comparative dataset the vertebral column of a new   species of early hominin, Australopithecus sediba . Late last   year, I was part of a team that excavated and cataloged a large number   of hominin fossils at Rising Star Cave in the Cradle of Humankind, South   Africa. I worked with an international team of researchers this summer   to describe what is likely a new and surprising species of hominin that   will undoubtedly alter the way we think about human evolution.      I continue to teach undergraduate courses like Human   Evolution, Human Origins, Problems and Perspectives in Human Evolution,   and Evolution and Biology of Human Behavior, along with graduate courses   like Interpreting Human Skeletal Morphology and Integrative   Paleoanthropology I. I hope to offer new graduate and undergraduate   courses in the future. I have also been invited to give talks, both   internally at NYU (Evening Evolution Group, Center for Genomics and   Systems Biology) and at other universities (Yale, Stony Brook, and   CUNY). In 2012 and 2013, I served on the American Association of   Physical Anthropologists Program Committee, and, since January 2014 I   have served as Associate Editor at the Journal of Human Evolution. I am   also a contributor to the Encyclopedia of Human Evolution (B.A. Wood, ed. 2013 and online).    In addition to continuing PhD students, Cody Prang and Jenny Eyre,   Dr. Gabrielle Russo worked with me as a post-doctoral researcher in the   Spring of 2014. We are currently finalizing several research projects on   fossil hominin vertebrae and a comparative study of the ursid (bear)   vertebral column, with implications for the evolution of convergent   traits in hominoids (apes). This fall, Alex DeCasien joins the PhD   program to work with me and Dr. James Higham on skeletal correlates of   sexual selection.

A major feature of developmental networks is their robustness (Masel &amp; Siegal 2009). That is, they are tolerant of both environmental and genetic perturbations. Our lab uses both experimental and computational approaches to understand the causes and evolutionary consequences of this robustness.          One major experimental focus in our lab is on the process of sexual differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster and related flies. Sexual differentiation is a powerful model system for studying the evolution of development because many aspects of sexual morphology, physiology and behavior differ between closely related species, thereby enabling high-resolution comparative analysis. Despite this rapid divergence, sexual traits are highly robust within species and indeed are often diagnostic of species. We are using genomic and genetic approaches to identify and characterize regulatory pathways involved in genital development and function in D. melanogaster (e.g., Chatterjee et al. 2011). This will lay the groundwork for determining how these robust pathways diverged between closely related species.       A second major experimental focus is on directly identifying and characterizing genes that contribute to robustness of many traits. We have screened the genome of the laboratory yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for genes whose deletion increases the variation in the morphologies of individual, genetically identical cells. Yeast is advantageous for this work because of its wealth of genetic and genomic resources, and because it lends itself to high-throughput analyses. Hundreds of yeast genes increase morphological variation when deleted, and these genes tend to be highly connected in cellular networks (Levy &amp; Siegal 2008). We are currently testing whether the same genes also buffer genetic differences between cells, and whether the variation that is revealed by impairment of these genes is potentially beneficial. This work is complemented by theoretical investigations into the evolution of complex gene networks (e.g., Bergman &amp; Siegal 2003; Siegal et al. 2007), as well as bioinformatic analyses of regulatory networks (e.g., Chen et al. 2010), which give us predictions to test experimentally.

Its mission is to enhance and facilitate research on all fields of biological anthropology and archaeology that are broadly related to the study of human origins and evolution from a biological and cultural perspective. The aim is to foster and support multidisciplinary investigations, with an emphasis on the development of collaborative projects, international fieldwork, and state-of-the-art laboratory research. Faculty members associated with the Center currently work on aspects of primate and human paleontology, skeletal biology and comparative anatomy, molecular primatology, population genetics, primate socioecology and conservation, Paleolithic archaeology, zooarchaeology, and the origins of symbolism, complex societies, and cities and states. In addition to research, the Center also aims to promote a greater understanding and appreciation of the study of human origins among the academic community and the public at large through conferences, workshops, educational programs, and outreach activities.
