The service can be accessed directly at wikis.nyu.edu , or see the NYU Wikis pages for more information.      Peer-to-Peer File Sharing    Peer-to-peer file sharing applications are used to connect you directly to another person's computer   (and, frequently, to give them the ability to connect to your machine) in order to transfer files between the two   computers. NYU has specific recommendations and restrictions for the use of these applications on NYU's   network. See the Peer-to-Peer File Sharing page for details.      Live Audio Production    Faculty members interested in recording live audio for use in the classroom or for research can use the services available at the Fourth Street Academic Technology Center .

There are many free and legal sources of online digital media content    Click here to find out more.         The only types of servers that are       allowed on ResNet      are web servers. P2P programs that allow others to connect to      your machine are acting as a file server, and are therefore      not allowed.       If you use file sharing on NYU-NET or ResNet, NYU, as your      ISP, is obligated to forward to you any copyright complaints we receive      about activity on your computer.                 P2P File Sharing Overview    A large percentage of people who use the Internet have downloaded music or movies. And most of the individuals who download these files through paid services, file sharing applications, or peer-to-peer networks by now are aware of how prominent the issue of illegal downloading has become.    The University's stance on this issue is simple: downloading copyrighted material without permission is illegal, and you should not do it. You should also not use your computer to distribute copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder. Be aware: some applications for downloading music, movies and other files actually turn your computer into a server, allowing it to be used for distributing copyrighted material. If you are doing illegal downloads or distributions now or have done so, you should stop.    To better understand the multifaceted issues surrounding the issue of illegal P2P file sharing, click on any one of the panels above.      What is a peer-to-peer application?   Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications are used to connect you directly to another  person's computer, or \"peer\" (and, frequently, to give them the ability to connect to your machine)  in order to transfer files between the two computers. There are three key characteristics  that define a P2P application:     The ability to discover peers   The ability to query peers   The ability to share content with peers         What programs fall into this category?   The programs that fall into this category include Kazaa, iMesh, LimeWire, Gnutella, Azureus, Frostwire, Poisoned, Shareaza, BitTorrent, uTorrent, Vuze and many others.       Can I use P2P applications on ResNet?   You may not run any services (e.g., FTP services; listservers; publish mp3s using LimeWire, BitTorrent, etc.; publish files via generic file services) via NYU's wireless, NYURoam, or ResNet networks. You are allowed to run web (HTTP) servers on ResNet.         I'm using a \"paid premium content\" P2P service. Is that OK?   Certain P2P applications offer \"paid premium content,\" but in many cases the consumer is still illegally sharing copyrighted materials. Prior to being legally required to shutdown, the once popular Limewire P2P service noted the following in its copyright information section:    The program distributed by Lime Wire, \"LimeWire BASIC\" and \"LimeWire PRO\", is legal software, but like many legal things, it is possible to use it in illegal ways. Specifically, it is illegal for you to use LimeWire to share, distribute or download (all of which we call sharing) copyrighted files without permission, or to share unlawful pornographic materials...... Your use of LimeWire BASIC or purchase of LimeWire PRO does not constitute a license in or to share unauthorized or unlawful materials.     Moreover, ResNet policies forbid running any service (FTP, listservers, P2P file sharing servers, publishing files via generic file services, etc.) on the residential network service except web (HTTP) servers.       The RIAA has a list of \"approved\" P2P file sharing applications. Can I use those?   No, you may not. Unfortunately, these P2P applications still violate NYU ResNet policies.       Where can I find legally free or paid media content?   There are many legal alternatives for consuming audio and video media content. Often, this content is provided at little to no cost to the consumer. Visit the Educause Legal Sources of Online Content website for more information.

There are many free and legal sources of online digital media content    Click here to find out more.         The only types of servers that are       allowed on ResNet      are web servers. P2P programs that allow others to connect to      your machine are acting as a file server, and are therefore      not allowed.       If you use file sharing on NYU-NET or ResNet, NYU, as your      ISP, is obligated to forward to you any copyright complaints we receive      about activity on your computer.                 P2P File Sharing Overview    A large percentage of people who use the Internet have downloaded music or movies. And most of the individuals who download these files through paid services, file sharing applications, or peer-to-peer networks by now are aware of how prominent the issue of illegal downloading has become.    The University's stance on this issue is simple: downloading copyrighted material without permission is illegal, and you should not do it. You should also not use your computer to distribute copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright holder. Be aware: some applications for downloading music, movies and other files actually turn your computer into a server, allowing it to be used for distributing copyrighted material. If you are doing illegal downloads or distributions now or have done so, you should stop.    To better understand the multifaceted issues surrounding the issue of illegal P2P file sharing, click on any one of the panels above.      What is a peer-to-peer application?   Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing applications are used to connect you directly to another  person's computer, or \"peer\" (and, frequently, to give them the ability to connect to your machine)  in order to transfer files between the two computers. There are three key characteristics  that define a P2P application:     The ability to discover peers   The ability to query peers   The ability to share content with peers         What programs fall into this category?   The programs that fall into this category include Kazaa, iMesh, LimeWire, Gnutella, Azureus, Frostwire, Poisoned, Shareaza, BitTorrent, uTorrent, Vuze and many others.       Can I use P2P applications on ResNet?   You may not run any services (e.g., FTP services; listservers; publish mp3s using LimeWire, BitTorrent, etc.; publish files via generic file services) via NYU's wireless, NYURoam, or ResNet networks. You are allowed to run web (HTTP) servers on ResNet.         I'm using a \"paid premium content\" P2P service. Is that OK?   Certain P2P applications offer \"paid premium content,\" but in many cases the consumer is still illegally sharing copyrighted materials. Prior to being legally required to shutdown, the once popular Limewire P2P service noted the following in its copyright information section:    The program distributed by Lime Wire, \"LimeWire BASIC\" and \"LimeWire PRO\", is legal software, but like many legal things, it is possible to use it in illegal ways. Specifically, it is illegal for you to use LimeWire to share, distribute or download (all of which we call sharing) copyrighted files without permission, or to share unlawful pornographic materials...... Your use of LimeWire BASIC or purchase of LimeWire PRO does not constitute a license in or to share unauthorized or unlawful materials.     Moreover, ResNet policies forbid running any service (FTP, listservers, P2P file sharing servers, publishing files via generic file services, etc.) on the residential network service except web (HTTP) servers.       The RIAA has a list of \"approved\" P2P file sharing applications. Can I use those?   No, you may not. Unfortunately, these P2P applications still violate NYU ResNet policies.       Where can I find legally free or paid media content?   There are many legal alternatives for consuming audio and video media content. Often, this content is provided at little to no cost to the consumer. Visit the Educause Legal Sources of Online Content website for more information.    Page last reviewed: December 3, 2010"}]}]
