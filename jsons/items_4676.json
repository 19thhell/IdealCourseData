It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in U.S.-European relations in the twentieth century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multi-faceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which U.S. history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies. The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g. with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.   Bio   Martin Klimke studied at the University of Goettingen, Amherst College, and the University of Heidelberg.

It is dedicated to the role of America in the world with an emphasis on processes of transnational exchange in U.S.-European relations in the twentieth century, and more particularly in the period of the Cold War. Klimke analyzes the multi-faceted impact \u201cAmerican\u201d ideas and cultural practices have had once adopted in different sociopolitical settings, and the ways in which U.S. history has become intertwined with other countries\u2019 politics and societies. The increasingly global cultural, political, and military presence of the United States, especially after World War II, as well as the country\u2019s complex entanglement with the forces of globalization, are at the center of his scholarly interests. A special focus of his research is transnational protest movements, processes of cultural transfer, and global networks of dissent, e.g. with respect to 1960/70s protest movements, the African American freedom struggle in the 20th century, or the grassroots activism of the 1980s.   Bio   Martin Klimke studied at the University of Goettingen, Amherst College, and the University of Heidelberg.

Explores how people in  France grappled with questions of race, religion, and gender during  the 20th century. It begins with the Dreyfus Affair, a national  convulsion over anti-Semitism and a miscarriage of justice that  influenced debates over prejudice in France for decades thereafter.  It then turns to the experiences of women and men during the First  World War, including soldiers and workers recruited from the  colonies. After examining the dynamics of discrimination against  Jews, colonial subjects, and women during World War II, the course  concludes with the French-Algerian war (1954\u201362), when issues of  race, religion, and gender surfaced with explosive force in  metropolitan France, as well as in Algeria.      Liberal Visions of  Empire   HIST-UA 195 Offered  every other year. Sartori. 4 points.   A lecture course  exploring the changing relationship between British liberal thought  and Britain\u2019s expanding empire from the 17th to the 20th centuries.  Liberal conceptions of equality and freedom are generally understood  to be fundamentally anti-imperialistic in impulse, as historically  complicit with imperialist agendas, and as inherently and logically  disposed to imperialist domination. The course attempts to put these  different claims into historical context and to periodize their  applicability.      Women in European  Society Since 1750   HIST-UA 196 Identical  to SCA-UA 716. Offered every other year. Nolan. 4 points.   Examines critically the  public and private lives of European women from 1750 to the present.  An introduction discusses the theory and methods of using gender as a  category in history and proceeds to a chronological survey of women\u2019s  experience from both a social and a political viewpoint. Women are  examined as participants in war and revolution, as well as workers,  consumers, and mothers in everyday life. The focus is primarily on  France, Germany, and England, with some reference to women\u2019s  experience in America.      Gendering the Middle  Ages   HIST-UA 197 Offered  every fourth year. Bedos-Rezak. 4 points.   Takes up questions  about the identity and agency of women and about the performative  nature of gender in Western culture and society during the Middle  Ages. In exploring medieval texts and images, and the interpretive  body of scholarship that made it its task to recover and to make  visible ways that medieval women acted in history, we pay specific  attention to interactions between women and men in order to  understand how assumptions about male and female nature informed and  gendered the very possibility of action, expression, empowerment, and  subjectivity.      The History of Western  Medicine   HIST-UA 202 Offered  every other year. Appuhn. 4 points.   Covers the history of  Western medicine and medical thought, from antiquity to the present.  It familiarizes students with basic questions and concepts in the  history of medicine, models for understanding the historical  development of medical thought; the varied historical relationships  between medicine and other healing practices such as religion,  alchemy, and homeopathy; the influence of culture and politics on the  development of medical thought; and the role that the emergence of a  medical profession characterized by formal training and a coherent  scientific viewpoint played in the development of Western societies.    Italian Colonialism   HIST-UA 286 Identical  to ITAL-UA 167, EURO-UA 161. Offered every two to three years.  Ben-Ghiat. 4 points.

History of the Byzantine Empire II, 10th-15th Centuries HIST-UA 305 Offered every year. 4 points. The course surveys the main political developments in Byzantium from the end of the 9th century to the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453. Parallel to the study of the historical framework, the course adopts a diachronic approach to examine some of the essential concepts, institutions, and cultural themes of Byzantium, such as imperial ideology, church and monasticism, family and women, the economy, and the cultural and artistic revivals of the middle and late periods.      United States  History Lectures      European Migration to  America: The Irish and Jewish Experiences   HIST-UA 186 Identical  to HBRJD-UA 686. Offered every other year. Diner, Scally. 4 points.   Looks at the  comparative experiences of two immigrant groups to the United States,  the Irish and the East European Jews. Explores the forces that  propelled the migrants out of their homes and the ways in which they  created communities and new identities in America. Because of its  comparative nature, this course asks students to seek both  similarities and differences in those migrations. Additionally, there  have been numerous points of interaction between the Jews and the  Irish. This course focuses on how these two groups understood and  related to each other.    North American Environmental History HIST-UA 595 Offered every other fall. 4 points. This lecture and discussion course introduces students to the major themes, events, scholars, and ways of thinking that together make up American environmental history as an academic field. Environmental history is the study of the ways in which humans have interacted with, shaped, and been shaped by their physical environments in the past. It takes as a central premise that nature, too, has a history, one profoundly shaped by human beings, and that the record of the human past is incomplete without some account of the role the physical world has played in human events.    Environmental History  of New York City   HIST-UA 596 Offered  every other year. Needham. 4 points.   Investigates topics in  the environmental history of New York City from the 1600s to the  present. From the city\u2019s origins as a harbor city at the  intersection of the Hudson River and the Atlantic, to the Manhattan  bedrock that anchors modern skyscrapers, natural geography has  determined urban possibility. Infrastructure that has become \u201csecond  nature\u201d brings water and electricity to the city and carries its  waste to distant landfills. The park lands that dot the city have  become both playgrounds where New Yorkers seek green space and  battlefields where they fight over the proper ways to enjoy those  spaces. Through readings, site visits, and original research, the  course introduces students to the environmental history of New York.

Seminar: Topics in  History   HIST-UA 401 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      European History  Colloquium: Rome, Constantinople, Istanbul HIST-UA 160 Offered every other year. 4 points. This   course proposes a comparative study of the cities of Rome,   Constantinople and Istanbul, the capitals of the most powerful empires   of the Mediterranean from antiquity to the modern period. Beyond the   history and architecture of these cities, we will also explore key   issues of urban history, including the role of cities as stages for the   projection of imperial ideology, the position of religion with the   cities, professions, neighborhoods, women, minorities and marginals,   revolts, disease and healthcare, and finally, entertainment. Seminar: Italian  Fascism HIST-UA 171 Identical  to ITAL-UA 165. Offered every two to three years. Ben-Ghiat, Ferrari.  4 points. An interdisciplinary  examination of the cultural production of the fascist period.  Students examine the image that the fascist regime produced of itself  through the study of popular novels, architecture, film, and  political speeches.      Seminar: Culture and  Communism in Eastern Europe   HIST-UA 263 Offered  every other year. Wolff. 4 points.   Studies the history of  communism in Eastern Europe since World War II and especially focuses  on issues of intellectual history\u2014that is, the ways in which the  intellectuals of Eastern Europe, as representative of their national  cultures, responded to the crises, challenges, and constraints of  communism between 1945 and 1989. Issues include the nature of  political dissidence under authoritarian governments in Eastern  Europe. Focuses on writers from Poland, the former Czechoslovakia,  and the former Yugoslavia. The format of the course is a discussion  colloquium, with weekly assigned readings.      Seminar: Crusade and  Trade: Western Expansion in the Eastern Mediterranean, 11th to 15th  Centuries   HIST-UA 265 Offered  every other year. Smyrlis. 4 points.   Examines Western  expansion in the Eastern Mediterranean from the 11th to the 15th  century, focusing on the two main, peaceful or violent, ways of  Western penetration in the East. Topics include Western Europe in the  period leading to the Crusades; the creation of overseas states (by  the Franks) and of commercial empires (by the Italians); the  Easterners\u2019 reaction to the presence of the Westerners; and the  latter\u2019s influence on the social, political, economic, and cultural  traditions of the East.    Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union. This course traces the evolution of European capitalism   during the twentieth century, from a laissez-faire to a social market   economy. Throughout the semester we will study key themes and turning   points that shaped Europe's economic development: the Great Depression;   the World Wars; alternative ways of organizing an economic life under   fascism and communism; the stagnation of the 1970s; and European   economic integration.    Colloquium: Topics in  Early Modern Europe   HIST-UA 279 Identical  to MEDI-UA 279. Offered every year. Appuhn, Shovlin. 4 points.   The specific subjects  treated in this colloquium vary according to student need and instructor  interest.      Seminar: European  Enlightenment: A Revolution of the Mind   HIST-UA 286 Offered  every other year. Shovlin. 4 points.   Students examine  classic texts in Enlightenment studies as well as interpretations of  the Enlightenment that place these texts in cultural context and  larger historical perspective. Topics include the philosophes and the  gods, the social and political sciences, ethical thought, utopian  literature, and popular culture.      Seminar: Origins of  World War I   HIST-UA 288 Offered  every third year. Berenson. 4 points.   Explores the causes of  and responsibility for the war. Topics include the diplomatic crises  before 1914, the internal situation of Austria, the assassination of  the Archduke Ferdinand, and the varying interpretations of the causes  of the war.      Seminar: The Russian  Revolution   HIST-UA 291 Offered  every other year. Kotsonis. 4 points.   This seminar has two  objectives: (1) an in-depth survey of the events, personalities, and  interpretations of the Russian Revolution through a close analysis of  numerous and varied sources and (2) a workshop in the writing of  history through the preparation and criticism of short papers and  written exercises.      Seminar: 19th-Century  France   HIST-UA 302 Offered  every other year. Berenson. 4 points.   Social and political  history of France from the French Revolution to the late 19th  century. Topics include the French Revolution and its legacy; the  Empire; movements of the right and the left; urbanization; the  Revolution of 1848 and the Paris Commune; the Dreyfus Affair;  colonization; and the question of nationhood, citizenship, and the  emergence of a French identity.

Topics  include nationalism, socialism, labor conflict, economic crisis, war  and collaboration, colonialism and decolonization, student uprising,  immigration, the establishment of a presidential regime, and regional  and ethnic militancy. Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.      Seminar: Topics in  Medieval History   HIST-UA 441   Bedos-Rezak, Griffiths. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Topics in  European Intellectual History   HIST-UA 443   Geroulanos, Shovlin. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Britain since  World War II   HIST-UA 451 Open to  history majors who have completed Historical Studies: Theories and  Practice (HIST-UA 101), or by permission of the instructor. Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.    Colloquium: The Place of Regions in U.S. History HIST-UA 414 Offered every year. 4 points. In this research seminar, students will explore how the concept of region and the meanings of regional differences have changed throughout U.S. history. Course readings will move between regions and through time as we explore themes including environment, geography, economics, politics, and culture. While class discussions will focus on a series of secondary readings, students are encouraged to draw on a wide range of materials, ranging from music, films, and physical objects to political reports and historical monographs, in writing a research paper that will explore some aspect of regional history in the United States.    Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.   Explores the history of  history writing in the United States, examining national histories  written in the 19th and 20th centuries as part of American  intellectual history. Focuses on theme, interpretation, points of  view, and style in the work of past historians.    Liberalism and Conservatism since the New Deal HIST-UA 418 Offered every year. 4 points. This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.      Seminar: Constructions  of Race in U.S. History   HIST-UA 680 Hodes. 4  points.   Explores the ideas of  race and how racial classifications have changed over time and across  regions and cultures in the United States. Themes include language,  color, law, science, slavery, mixed ancestries, and white identity.      Seminar: Race, Civil  War, Reconstruction   HIST-UA 683 Hodes. 4  points.   The American Civil War  punctuated the 19th century and transformed the nation. This seminar  explores the experiences of slaves and former slaves, politicians and  community leaders, civilians and families, soldiers and veterans, and  proceeds from the premise that slavery and race were central to the  war\u2019s causes and consequences.      Seminar: Ideology and  Social Change in American History   HIST-UA 684 Offered  every other year. 4 points.   Explores classical  arguments in American history concerning social behavior. Central  themes: the power of cultural conditioning, the role of schooling and  other acculturating institutions, the uses of \u201cuplifting\u201d reform  and organizational benevolence, and the intervention of professional  experts into social policymaking. Special attention to the role of  ethnic and racial leaders, proponents of success and socialization,  critical investigations of family and femininity, and analysis of  distinctive generational responses to these and related issues.      Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.   Explores the historical  issues of the Great Depression and the New Deal years, 1933\u20131941,  by discussing several relevant works on this period. Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.      Seminar: Topics in  Latin American History   HIST-UA 471 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.      Seminar: Topics in  Japanese History   HIST-UA 474 Offered  every other year.

Examines 20th-century  Taiwan and China in their interrelationship and their divergent  paths. It is not a diplomatic or international history course.  Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.    Colloquium : Gender and  Radicalism in Modern China   HIST-UA 536 Identical  to EAST-UA 536. Offered every year. Karl. 4 points.   Examines the  interrelated rise of political, ideological, and cultural radicalisms  and of gender issues as a major subject and object of transformative  social activity in 19th- and 20th-century China. Introduces  approaches to gender theory and historical analysis through the use  of primary and secondary sources on China, as well as through films  and other visuals. Emphasis is on synthesizing contradictory material  and on historical analytical issues. Includes a heavy writing and  class-discussion component.

The period covered extends from  the New Kingdom in Egypt (1550 B.C.E.) to the forest kingdoms of West  Africa on the eve of the Atlantic slave trade in the mid-15th  century.      Seminar: Japan and  World War II in Asia   HIST-UA 710 Identical  to EAST-UA 710. Offered every other year. 4 points.   Takes up a watershed  event in Japanese history, the greatest single preoccupation of  Japanese historians. The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Global and Special  Topics Seminars    History of the Body HIST-UA 310 Offered every two years. 4 points. History of the Body from Birth to Death. Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture. Readings will range from the seventeenth to the twentieth century and will focus primarily, but not exclusively on Europe and the United States. Topics will include the study of the production and consumption of particular commodities; middle-class and working-class consumer cultures in the nineteenth century; and mass production and mass consumption in the twentieth century. We will look at protests and popular movements organized around issues of consumption; examine how products from the non-European world transformed European and American consumption; and how European, and especially American patterns of consumption shaped consumption elsewhere.
