M-Th 9:30-10:45 TBA 002. M-Th 3:30-4:45, TBA Introduction to the essentials of Latin, the language of Vergil, Caesar, and Seneca. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Latin rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 006, Intermediate Latin I: Reading Prose 001. M, T, Th 9:30-10:45, TBA 002. M, T, W 3:30-4:45, TBA Teaches second-year students to read Latin prose through comprehensive grammar review; emphasis on the proper techniques for reading (correct phrase division, the identification of clauses, and reading in order); and practice reading at sight. Authors may include Caesar, Cicero, Cornelius Nepos, Livy, Petronius, or Pliny, at the instructor's discretion. CLASS-UA 007, Elementary Ancient Greek I, M-Th 11:00-12:15, TBA Introduction to the complex but highly beautiful language of ancient Greece--the language of Homer, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato. Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabul ary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek I: Plato , M,T,W 2:00-3:15, David Sider Reading of Plato\u2019s Apology and Crito and selections from the Republic. The purpose of the course is to develop facility in reading Attic prose. Supplements readings in Greek with lectures on Socrates and the Platonic dialogues. CLASS-UA 202, The Body in Antiquity , M&amp;W 2:00-3:15, Claire Bubb This course considers the body in the ancient world. It will focus on scientific understanding of physiological function as well as contemporary cultural, religious, and legal attitudes to the corpse and the living body. We will begin with mummies and the medical texts of Ancient Egypt and move chronologically through Greek and Roman periods, ending with Arabic transmission and interpretation of Classical thought. Scientific topics will include the developing understanding of the vascular system and the so-called \u201cfailure\u201d to discover circulation, philosophical and physiological discussions of cognitive function and the soul-body interface, and the ongoing debate between head- and heart-centric theories. Cultural topics will include burial practices, the early Christian view of the body, the body as class signifier in Roman law, and the body in literature from Homer to Greek and Arabic novels. CLASS-UA242, identical to HIST-UA 200, HEL-UA 242 Greek History from the Bronze Age to Alexander, T&amp;Th 12:15-1:145, Barbara Kowalzig Until a few decades ago, Greek history began with Homer and dealt narrowly with the Greek world. Thanks to archaeology, the social sciences, and other historical tools, the chronological and geographical horizons have been pushed back. The history of the Greeks now starts in the third millennium B.C.E. and is connected to the civilization that lay to the east, rooted in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This course traces Greek history from the Greeks' earliest appearance to the advent of Alexander. CLASS-UA 292, History of Ancient Law , M&amp;W 11:00-12:15, Michael Peachin Examines the development of law and legal systems and the relationships of these to the societies that created them, starting with some ancient Near Eastern systems and working down to the Roman period. The main focus is on the fully developed system of Roman law. CLASS-UA 291.000, Teachers, Students, and the Curriculum in the Greek and Roman World , T&amp;TH 2:00-3:15, Raffaella Cribiore                           Was ancient education open to all? Did ancient students have homework, vacations, and report cards? How was the curriculum of a liberal art education? This course will cover these and many others questions concerning going to school in antiquity, from Plato to late Roman times. It will cover the three basic levels from elementary to grammatical and rhetorical education. Particular emphasis will be put on rhetorical education and students will learn to compose declamations. The course will be based on literary and archaeological sources, and on the educational material from Greco-Roman Egypt. Most of the readings will be posted on Blackboard. Attendance is mandatory. There will be midterm and final exams and a short paper. CLASS-UA 351, Archaeologies of Rome and the Empire , T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Sebastian Heath In this course we examine the visual and material culture of ancient Rome - including objects, images, buildings and sculpture - in order to gain a better understanding of how it functioned as an imperial system. The chronological range is the later centuries BCE, when Rome took control of overseas lands, through the fourth century CE, by which time military pressure and Christianity are changing the nature of the Roman state. In this long timespan, Rome created a spectacularly successful territorial empire that is expressed in material forms. The course will progress chronologically while pausing on particular topics, such as the effect on the capital of Rome's first conquests, the role of imperial propaganda and economic integration in cities such as Pompeii and Troy, and the creation of multi-cultural societies on Rome's eastern frontier. We'll look at large-scale art such as imperial portraits while also taking account of archaeological finds, such as Roman pottery on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Our goal is to let the objects speak for themselves while making use of our modern vocabulary of imperial hegemony and the response of conquered peoples. CLASS-UA 700, identical to PHIL-UA 122, HEL-UA 700, Greek Thinkers , M&amp;W 3:30-4:45, David Sider Western theorizing begins with the Greeks, who can be said to have invented or introduced all manner of thinking about the universe and human nature.Illustrative texts from the presocratics, mathematicians, philosophers, historians, and tragedians will be read. CLASS-UA 701, identical to COLIT-UA 852, Socrates and His Critics , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15, Vincent Renzi Despite having written nothing himself, Socrates is\u2014if not the most influential\u2014certainly one of the most influential intellectual figures in the Western tradition, for it is with Socrates, we are told, that \u201cphilosophy\u201d seems first to move from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. Indeed, so great is the magnitude of this change that we continue to term earlier thinkers \u201cpre-Socratic philosophers.\u201d His stature is marked again in the name given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic discourse, and an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the so-called Socratic method. In antiquity, importantly, he inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond those thinkers stretching to influence in Rome and Judea...and four centuries before the presumed time of Jesus, Socrates had already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political and religious views. In modernity, his life both fascinates and repels the attention, notably, of Nietzsche; though criticisms of his mode of existence he had already endured in his own time at the hands of the comedian Aristophanes, among others. Given the state of the evidence, one can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to try to recover any sense of the \u201chistorical Socrates\u201d; but we must likewise ask whether he does not perhaps exert a greater influence as a result of the reception of the doxography itself than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates never existed, would not the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?  CLASS-UA 876, Advanced Latin: Confessions, M&amp;W 9:30-10:145, Adam Becker This course will consist of close reading in Latin of selections from Augustine\u2019s Confessions . Composed in the late fourth century, the Confessions provides an excellent introduction to the cultural world of the later Roman Empire. We will examine Augustine\u2019s ideas and the idiosyncrasies of his language, and also consider how his text is in conversation with Classical literature. Through supplementary readings and occasional lectures students will learn about the background and context of the author and his work. Broader topics will include the early Christian reception of Classical Antiquity, Neoplatonism, Manichaeism, the cult of the saints, the emergence of monasticism, early Christian notions of the body and sexuality, Christian interpretation of scripture, and the creation of a new Christian literary culture. CLASS-UA 973, Advanced Greek: Sophocles' Trachiniae, T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Anne Carson A study of Sophokles' Trachiniai with attention to different modes and styles of translation. I am interested in having the class create (communally) a new translation to be presented as a staged reading at the end of term, perhaps for the delectation of the rest of the department.

Bio &amp; Publications                  About the course   You may think you know ancient Israel quite well, or you may be sure you know nothing. In either case, this course is designed to make the acquaintance from scratch. My ancient Israel is strange, sometimes shocking, diverse, and mostly hidden. It can be approached from archaeology and non-biblical writing as well as from the Bible as its most famous artifact. I am a biblical scholar and student of ancient literature, so this class will lean toward what is written, embracing the Bible as a source. In a broadly chronological framework, we will ask what I hope to be unfamiliar questions, trying to get you to see things you had not considered before. The course assumes no prior knowledge, and all knowledge is built from the ground up based on \u201cprimary evidence,\u201d the actual material from the ancient world \u2013 including the Bible. Every full-class meeting will involve conversation in response to some piece of primary evidence, with expectation that students have as much right as any scholar to figure out who these people are for themselves.

M-Th 9:30-10:45 TBA 002. M-Th 3:30-4:45, TBA Introduction to the essentials of Latin, the language of Vergil, Caesar, and Seneca. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Latin rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 006, Intermediate Latin I: Reading Prose 001. M, T, Th 9:30-10:45, TBA 002. M, T, W 3:30-4:45, TBA Teaches second-year students to read Latin prose through comprehensive grammar review; emphasis on the proper techniques for reading (correct phrase division, the identification of clauses, and reading in order); and practice reading at sight. Authors may include Caesar, Cicero, Cornelius Nepos, Livy, Petronius, or Pliny, at the instructor's discretion. CLASS-UA 007, Elementary Ancient Greek I, M-Th 11:00-12:15, TBA Introduction to the complex but highly beautiful language of ancient Greece--the language of Homer, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato. Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabul ary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek I: Plato , M,T,W 2:00-3:15, David Sider Reading of Plato\u2019s Apology and Crito and selections from the Republic. The purpose of the course is to develop facility in reading Attic prose. Supplements readings in Greek with lectures on Socrates and the Platonic dialogues. CLASS-UA 202, The Body in Antiquity , M&amp;W 2:00-3:15, Claire Bubb This course considers the body in the ancient world. It will focus on scientific understanding of physiological function as well as contemporary cultural, religious, and legal attitudes to the corpse and the living body. We will begin with mummies and the medical texts of Ancient Egypt and move chronologically through Greek and Roman periods, ending with Arabic transmission and interpretation of Classical thought. Scientific topics will include the developing understanding of the vascular system and the so-called \u201cfailure\u201d to discover circulation, philosophical and physiological discussions of cognitive function and the soul-body interface, and the ongoing debate between head- and heart-centric theories. Cultural topics will include burial practices, the early Christian view of the body, the body as class signifier in Roman law, and the body in literature from Homer to Greek and Arabic novels. CLASS-UA242, identical to HIST-UA 200, HEL-UA 242 Greek History from the Bronze Age to Alexander, T&amp;Th 12:15-1:145, Barbara Kowalzig Until a few decades ago, Greek history began with Homer and dealt narrowly with the Greek world. Thanks to archaeology, the social sciences, and other historical tools, the chronological and geographical horizons have been pushed back. The history of the Greeks now starts in the third millennium B.C.E. and is connected to the civilization that lay to the east, rooted in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This course traces Greek history from the Greeks' earliest appearance to the advent of Alexander. CLASS-UA 292, History of Ancient Law , M&amp;W 11:00-12:15, Michael Peachin Examines the development of law and legal systems and the relationships of these to the societies that created them, starting with some ancient Near Eastern systems and working down to the Roman period. The main focus is on the fully developed system of Roman law. CLASS-UA 291.000, Teachers, Students, and the Curriculum in the Greek and Roman World , T&amp;TH 2:00-3:15, Raffaella Cribiore                           Was ancient education open to all? Did ancient students have homework, vacations, and report cards? How was the curriculum of a liberal art education? This course will cover these and many others questions concerning going to school in antiquity, from Plato to late Roman times. It will cover the three basic levels from elementary to grammatical and rhetorical education. Particular emphasis will be put on rhetorical education and students will learn to compose declamations. The course will be based on literary and archaeological sources, and on the educational material from Greco-Roman Egypt. Most of the readings will be posted on Blackboard. Attendance is mandatory. There will be midterm and final exams and a short paper. CLASS-UA 351, Archaeologies of Rome and the Empire , T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Sebastian Heath In this course we examine the visual and material culture of ancient Rome - including objects, images, buildings and sculpture - in order to gain a better understanding of how it functioned as an imperial system. The chronological range is the later centuries BCE, when Rome took control of overseas lands, through the fourth century CE, by which time military pressure and Christianity are changing the nature of the Roman state. In this long timespan, Rome created a spectacularly successful territorial empire that is expressed in material forms. The course will progress chronologically while pausing on particular topics, such as the effect on the capital of Rome's first conquests, the role of imperial propaganda and economic integration in cities such as Pompeii and Troy, and the creation of multi-cultural societies on Rome's eastern frontier. We'll look at large-scale art such as imperial portraits while also taking account of archaeological finds, such as Roman pottery on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Our goal is to let the objects speak for themselves while making use of our modern vocabulary of imperial hegemony and the response of conquered peoples. CLASS-UA 700, identical to PHIL-UA 122, HEL-UA 700, Greek Thinkers , M&amp;W 3:30-4:45, David Sider Western theorizing begins with the Greeks, who can be said to have invented or introduced all manner of thinking about the universe and human nature.Illustrative texts from the presocratics, mathematicians, philosophers, historians, and tragedians will be read. CLASS-UA 701, identical to COLIT-UA 852, Socrates and His Critics , T&amp;TH 11:00-12:15, Vincent Renzi Despite having written nothing himself, Socrates is\u2014if not the most influential\u2014certainly one of the most influential intellectual figures in the Western tradition, for it is with Socrates, we are told, that \u201cphilosophy\u201d seems first to move from natural history to an explicit concern for human affairs. Indeed, so great is the magnitude of this change that we continue to term earlier thinkers \u201cpre-Socratic philosophers.\u201d His stature is marked again in the name given to a distinctive form of philosophical literature, the Socratic discourse, and an approach to philosophical inquiry and instruction, the so-called Socratic method. In antiquity, importantly, he inspired Plato, Xenophon, the Stoics, the Skeptics, and the Cynics, beyond those thinkers stretching to influence in Rome and Judea...and four centuries before the presumed time of Jesus, Socrates had already suffered martyrdom for his idiosyncratic political and religious views. In modernity, his life both fascinates and repels the attention, notably, of Nietzsche; though criticisms of his mode of existence he had already endured in his own time at the hands of the comedian Aristophanes, among others. Given the state of the evidence, one can look only to the history of the reception of his thought to try to recover any sense of the \u201chistorical Socrates\u201d; but we must likewise ask whether he does not perhaps exert a greater influence as a result of the reception of the doxography itself than for his actual intellectual contributions. In short, had Socrates never existed, would not the tradition essentially have had to create him, in its move from its origins to ethics and political philosophy? Even given that he did actually live, is what we have of him really just such a necessary fiction?  CLASS-UA 876, Advanced Latin: Confessions, M&amp;W 9:30-10:145, Adam Becker This course will consist of close reading in Latin of selections from Augustine\u2019s Confessions . Composed in the late fourth century, the Confessions provides an excellent introduction to the cultural world of the later Roman Empire. We will examine Augustine\u2019s ideas and the idiosyncrasies of his language, and also consider how his text is in conversation with Classical literature. Through supplementary readings and occasional lectures students will learn about the background and context of the author and his work. Broader topics will include the early Christian reception of Classical Antiquity, Neoplatonism, Manichaeism, the cult of the saints, the emergence of monasticism, early Christian notions of the body and sexuality, Christian interpretation of scripture, and the creation of a new Christian literary culture. CLASS-UA 973, Advanced Greek: Sophocles' Trachiniae, T&amp;TH 9:30-10:45, Anne Carson A study of Sophokles' Trachiniai with attention to different modes and styles of translation. I am interested in having the class create (communally) a new translation to be presented as a staged reading at the end of term, perhaps for the delectation of the rest of the department.
