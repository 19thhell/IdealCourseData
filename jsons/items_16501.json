Teaching Opportunities Students also will be provided with opportunities to gain teaching experiences by working as teaching assistants in courses offered by the department. Compensation for teaching is in addition to the normal PhD program stipend. The PhD Training program This full-time Doctor of Philosophy Program in Biology (with a guaranteed paid stipend for living expenses), is designed to develop independent research scientists. Students undertake independent research under the guidance of faculty sponsors and have access to state-of-the-art laboratories, sophisticated instrumentation and advanced computer facilities, and extensive library and e-journal holdings. Weekly pre-doctoral colloquia enable students to present their own work to a broad audience, while symposiums and seminars by distinguished visitors, speaking on a variety of topics, add breadth to the educational programs offered by the department. The MS Training program The Master of Science degree program , designed for full-time and part-time students, provides a comprehensive foundation in modern biology. Specialized master's-level tracks in biological sciences, bioinformatics and systems biology, oral biology, and recombinant DNA technology are available. The M.S./M.B.A. program, offered jointly by the Graduate School of Arts and Science and the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, leads to an M.S. degree in biology (GSAS) and an M.B.A. (Stern). This program meets a need for academic preparation and training of scientist-managers and research directors for the biotechnology and pharmacology industry, academic industrial liaison personnel, and investment specialists for the financial sector. Global Opportunities         Students entering NYU\u2019s Graduate Program in Biology will have the option to participate in opportunities to perform thesis research projects at NYU\u2019s global sites in Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) and Shanghai (NYUSH).
