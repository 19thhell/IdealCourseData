Future research is needed to explore if the general principles extracted from this model are applicable to more complex categorizations.\u201d   Wang conducted the study with Tatiana Engel, a postdoctoral associate at the time of the study, and Jah Chaisangmongkon, a doctoral candidate in his group, in collaboration with experimentalist David Freedman, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago. Freedman had previously developed a behavioral paradigm for investigating electrical activity of single-neurons that are correlated with category memberships of visual stimuli.   In this neural-circuit model, which incorporates what we know about the organization and neurophysiology of the cortex, lower-level neural circuits send information about visual stimuli to a higher-level neural circuit where an analog stimulus feature (like the direction of a random pattern of moving dots) is classified into binary categories (A or B). The researchers\u2019 results showed that the model captured a wide range of experimental observations and yielded specific predictions that were confirmed by an analysis of single-neuron electrical activity recorded in a category-learning experiment.    Interestingly, the researchers found that learning a correct category boundary (dividing the continuous feature into A and B) requires top-down feedback projection from category-selective neurons to feature-coding neurons.   Since the pioneering work by NYU\u2019s J. Anthony Movshon, Stanford\u2019s William Newsome, and others, it has been well known that feature-coding sensory neurons reflect an animal\u2019s choice about categorical membership (A or B) of a stimulus in a probabilistic way (quantified as \u201cchoice probability\u201d). The common belief was that this is because a category choice is influenced by stochastic, or random, activity of sensory neurons through bottom-up, sensory-to-category pathways.   The new model, reported in the Nature Communications article, suggests a novel interpretation, namely that such \u201cchoice probability\u201d results from category-to-sensory, top-down signaling.   This finding offers new insights into feedback projections in the brain whose functional significance had previously been a long-standing puzzle, the researchers note.
