Gilbert All Rights Reserved     Course Description  Students will learn basic MIDI (Music Instrument Digital Interface) configurations and applications. Students will demonstrate a fundamental understanding of MIDI through applications of sequencing, music notation, and editing as learned in class and applied in studio sessions. Open to all students. No Pre-requisites.   Course Objectives:   1. Students will understand and be able to draw schematics of simple MIDI configurations in connecting instruments, interfaces, and computers.   2. Students will understand basic concepts of sound synthesis and sound sampling through the creation of several voices or instruments on the computer using the editing modes of synthesizers.   3. Students will understand the basics of a computer operating system and will demonstrate use of the sequencing soft ware through the creation of multi-timbral computer music works.   4. Students will understand the basics of a computer operating system and will demonstrate use of the music notation software through the creation of three scores: (1) piano/vocal, (2) choral, and (3) instrumental ensemble.
