Now more than ever, we need scientists who can navigate easily across these boundaries.   With this in mind, the PhD in Materials Chemistry program cultivates an interdisciplinary exchange between students and faculty. Together you collaborate on the latest in cutting-edge research &mdash; from the synthesis of polymeric materials to properties of synthetic and biological macromolecules. Our faculty specializes in the integration of biotechnology to create catalysts, sensors, and macromolecules for a variety of uses.   As a materials chemistry student, you&rsquo;ll examine how combinations of molecules and materials result in different properties. You&rsquo;ll see how this knowledge leads to the synthesis of new materials, with applications in superconductors, artificial organs, and other devices.
