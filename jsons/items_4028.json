I abhor party hats and noisemakers. Resolutions are for suckers. Maybe thats why Im a huge party pooper this time of year. I hate New Years Eve.    Dont get me wrong. I love parties. On Sunday morning, the first thing I think about is all of the fun I am going to have the following weekend. But New Years Eve is the one night of the year I would much rather head to bed early than party all night. I never really understood why I hated the holiday until a friend from college and I spent one rather long phone call discussing what she calls forced fun.    The reality: any event where fun is expected (i.e. New Years Eve) can never live up to expectations. Every year I would believe everyones hype and head to bars or parties (usually billed as the party of the century). The days leading to Dec. 31 would be filled with phone calls to friends about wardrobe and most importantly, who we were seeking out for that all important midnight kiss. The kiss, if you believe the hype, can be an indicator of your love life for the rest of the year.    New Years Eve is a night for singles: A night where you can kiss a stranger without regret. But it rarely happens the way you hope. According to the 2000 census, which is the most recent, there are about 60,000 men in Manhattan ages 25 to 29 that have never been married. I bet you can take a huge chunk out of that for the guys who have girlfriends or who are engaged. And dont forget to remove the gay guys from the equation. Im sure some spend New Years Eve out of town. There are about 63,000 women in that same age group who, according to the same census, are single. Finding the right person for that magical moment at midnight isnt that easy.    I almost always ended up disappointed. I have fun but not as much fun that would validate calling something the party of the century. Like the one year when I forgot to bring a sweater and ended up freezing all night in a tank top or like the years when Ive been hiding in a corner or a bathroom to avoid any awkward midnight moments.    Last year was my first New Years Eve while living in Manhattan. Growing in the suburbs outside of New York, I had taken the train in the past, but last year I knew that there were no crowded train rides home with men who smelled like theyd bathed in booze. It was my first New Years as an adult. I didnt mind that my neighborhood was infiltrated by tourists waiting to see the ball drop. I accepted an invitation to a friends party and shopped for a new outfit (no sequins, I swear). I was optimistic that the night wouldnt let me down.    I bought booze and braved the crowd walking to my friends apartment. Then it hit me. I was exhausted. All the primping and preparing had left me completely spent. On the elevator ride up, I knew that all the optimism in the world wasnt going to recharge my batteries.    I received a little boost of adrenaline as my friend introduced me to an attractive single guy (my friend and I had the kiss discussion before the party). After a few minutes of pleasant conversation, another girl came up beside me and put her arms around him. She was obviously drunk (most of the people were). She marked her territory, and I clearly had no shot after I spied them making out about five minutes later.    That was my last disappointment of the night. My friends are fun and it was great to spend time with people that I care about. But I still woke up the next day feeling let down by the holiday once again.    This year I received my first New Years Eve invitation somewhere between late October and early November. At Thanksgiving the inevitable, What are you doing for New Years? talks began. I tried to sidestep the question.    Then people started filling me in on their plans. One of my friends is having a party while others tried coaxing me into going on a booze cruise. Then it was my turn to seek out different groups to find out their plans. This usually takes up the bulk of December.    I had planned on staying in this year with my roommates. But ever the optimist, I decided to blow the dust of my party hat and give New Years Eve one more try. It may have taken some prodding by friends (including emails and phone calls), but I bought a ticket for a party at a bar Ive never been to which will most likely hold a lot of people I dont know.    Im too broke to buy a new outfit. But Im arming myself with something Ive never had before: A back-up plan. If all else fails and midnight magic doesnt happen, Im heading to another party not too far away. Ill head home to my apartment. That way when I wake up I can be happy that I have 364 days until I do it again.                    margaretbristol@hotmail.com (914) 393-4002                                        Home | Using Livewire Articles | Contributors | Submissions | Contact Us"}]},

For three decades, NYU has prepared students for successful careers as archivists, manuscript curators, documentary editors, oral historians, cultural resource managers, historical interpreters, and new media specialists.

In addition, internships are integrated with coursework, contributing to a professionalized and constructive learning environment.    See the Program page for information on application procedures and requirements, financial aid, advanced certificates in archives and public history, and the dual-degree program with Long Island University. See also the program brochure . For additional information, contact the director of the program, Professor Peter J. Wosh .    Advanced Certificates: Students who already hold M.A. degrees in the humanities or social sciences may attain advanced certificates in either Archives or Public History. The program requires satisfactory completion of 20 points in either concentration. You may find information about federally-mandated Gainful Employment Disclosure here .
