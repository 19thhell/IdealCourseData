a library of the classic works of Arabic Islamic literature and culture in parallel-text editions -- Arabic and English running texts on facing pages. The translations, which will be produced in a clear, modern idiom, will be accessible by general readers and academics alike. LAL will be a standing project with the long-term goal of translating a substantial library in the coming years. The project includes an international editorial board of leading Arabic scholars from around the world, each of whom will discuss their work at public workshops and lectures at NYU Abu Dhabi and other Abu Dhabi schools.

Like many pre-modern Arabic anthologies it aims at being both entertaining and informative. It ranges from the early Bedouin poems with their evocation of desert life to refined urban lyrical verse, from tender love poetry to sonorous eulogy or vicious lampoons, and from the heights of mystical rapture to the frivolity of comic verse. The prose contains anecdotes, entertaining or edifying tales and parables, a fairy-tale, a bawdy story, samples of literary criticism, and much more.     With this anthology, distinguished Arabist Geert Jan van Gelder brings together well-known texts as well as less familiar pieces that will be new even to scholars in the field. Many recent studies and anthologies of Middle Eastern literatures are primarily interested in Islam and religious matters\u2014an emphasis that leads to the common misconception that almost everything in the region was and is dominated by religion. Classical Arabic Literature instead brings to life the rich variety of pre-modern Arabic social and cultural life, where secular texts happily coexisted with religious ones. This masterful anthology, in English only, will introduce this vibrant literary heritage to a wide spectrum of new readers.     _______   Geert Jan van Gelder was Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford from 1998 to 2012. He is the author of several books on classical Arabic literature, including Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem and Of Dishes and Discourse: Classical Arabic Literary Representations of Food .                                 The Epistle on Legal Theory            Al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b   Edited and translated by Joseph E. Lowry     The Epistle on Legal Theory is the oldest surviving Arabic work on Islamic legal theory and the foundational document of Islamic jurisprudence. Its author, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b (d.204H / 820AD), was the eponymous founder of the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b legal school, one of the four rites in Sunni Islam. This fascinating work offers the first systematic treatment in Arabic of key issues in Islamic legal thought. These include a survey of the importance of Arabic as the language of revelation, principles of textual interpretation to be applied to the Qur\u2019an and prophetic Traditions, techniques for harmonizing apparently contradictory precedents, legal epistemology, rules of inference, and situations in which legal interpretation is required. The author illustrates his theoretical claims with numerous examples drawn from nearly all areas of Islamic law, including ritual, commercial law, tort law, and criminal law.     The text thus provides an important window into both Islamic law and legal thought generally and early Islamic intellectual history in particular. The Arabic text has been established on the basis of the two most important critical editions and includes variants in the notes, while the English text is a new translation by a leading scholar of Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b and his thought. The Epistle on Legal Theory represents one of the earliest complete works on Islamic law, one that is centrally important for the formation of Islamic legal thought and the Islamic legal tradition.     ________   Joseph E. Lowry is Associate Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. His books include Early Islamic Legal Theory: The Ris\u0101la of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b . His research and publications focus on the Qur\u2019an, Islamic law, and Arabic literature. Before becoming an academic he was an attorney in private practice in Washington, D.C.                                   A Treasury of Virtues: Sayings, Sermons and Teachings of \u02bfAl\u012b with the One Hundred Proverbs, attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93            Al-Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b al-Qu\u1e0d\u0101\u02bf\u012b     Edited and translated by Tahe ra Qutbuddin     A Treasury of Virtues is a collection of sayings, sermons, and teachings attributed to \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib (d. 40H/661AD), cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, and fourth caliph. \u02bfAl\u012b was an acknowledged master of Arabic eloquence and a renowned sage of Islamic wisdom. Through proverbs and aphorisms, sermons and speeches, prayers and supplications, epistles and contracts, testimonials and homilies, verse and dialogues, it provides instruction on how to be a decent human being. And it combines these ethical teachings with religious exhortations and preparation for eternal life in the hereafter. Moreover, the lessons of the text are clothed in the cadenced parallelisms of a consummate oral culture, and the vivid metaphors of the Arabian desert. Appealing to the addressee\u2019s  higher nature, they also beguile his aesthetic sensibilities, integrating art and edification in an exquisite package of verbal ingenuity.     Of the many compilations of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words, A Treasury of Virtues arguably possesses the broadest compass of genres, and the largest variety of themes. The shorter One Hundred Proverbs is also a compilation of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words. Attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 (\u201cthe father of Arabic prose\u201d), it has a celebrity status in its own category and its pithy one-liners are quotable quotes of the finest order. This volume presents the first English translation of both these important texts, with a new critical edition based on several original manuscripts.

a library of the classic works of Arabic Islamic literature and culture in parallel-text editions -- Arabic and English running texts on facing pages. The translations, which will be produced in a clear, modern idiom, will be accessible by general readers and academics alike. LAL will be a standing project with the long-term goal of translating a substantial library in the coming years. The project includes an international editorial board of leading Arabic scholars from around the world, each of whom will discuss their work at public workshops and lectures at NYU Abu Dhabi and other Abu Dhabi schools.

Like many pre-modern Arabic anthologies it aims at being both entertaining and informative. It ranges from the early Bedouin poems with their evocation of desert life to refined urban lyrical verse, from tender love poetry to sonorous eulogy or vicious lampoons, and from the heights of mystical rapture to the frivolity of comic verse. The prose contains anecdotes, entertaining or edifying tales and parables, a fairy-tale, a bawdy story, samples of literary criticism, and much more.     With this anthology, distinguished Arabist Geert Jan van Gelder brings together well-known texts as well as less familiar pieces that will be new even to scholars in the field. Many recent studies and anthologies of Middle Eastern literatures are primarily interested in Islam and religious matters\u2014an emphasis that leads to the common misconception that almost everything in the region was and is dominated by religion. Classical Arabic Literature instead brings to life the rich variety of pre-modern Arabic social and cultural life, where secular texts happily coexisted with religious ones. This masterful anthology, in English only, will introduce this vibrant literary heritage to a wide spectrum of new readers.     _______   Geert Jan van Gelder was Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford from 1998 to 2012. He is the author of several books on classical Arabic literature, including Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem and Of Dishes and Discourse: Classical Arabic Literary Representations of Food .                                 The Epistle on Legal Theory            Al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b   Edited and translated by Joseph E. Lowry     The Epistle on Legal Theory is the oldest surviving Arabic work on Islamic legal theory and the foundational document of Islamic jurisprudence. Its author, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b (d.204H / 820AD), was the eponymous founder of the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b legal school, one of the four rites in Sunni Islam. This fascinating work offers the first systematic treatment in Arabic of key issues in Islamic legal thought. These include a survey of the importance of Arabic as the language of revelation, principles of textual interpretation to be applied to the Qur\u2019an and prophetic Traditions, techniques for harmonizing apparently contradictory precedents, legal epistemology, rules of inference, and situations in which legal interpretation is required. The author illustrates his theoretical claims with numerous examples drawn from nearly all areas of Islamic law, including ritual, commercial law, tort law, and criminal law.     The text thus provides an important window into both Islamic law and legal thought generally and early Islamic intellectual history in particular. The Arabic text has been established on the basis of the two most important critical editions and includes variants in the notes, while the English text is a new translation by a leading scholar of Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b and his thought. The Epistle on Legal Theory represents one of the earliest complete works on Islamic law, one that is centrally important for the formation of Islamic legal thought and the Islamic legal tradition.     ________   Joseph E. Lowry is Associate Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. His books include Early Islamic Legal Theory: The Ris\u0101la of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b . His research and publications focus on the Qur\u2019an, Islamic law, and Arabic literature. Before becoming an academic he was an attorney in private practice in Washington, D.C.                                   A Treasury of Virtues: Sayings, Sermons and Teachings of \u02bfAl\u012b with the One Hundred Proverbs, attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93            Al-Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b al-Qu\u1e0d\u0101\u02bf\u012b     Edited and translated by Tahe ra Qutbuddin     A Treasury of Virtues is a collection of sayings, sermons, and teachings attributed to \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib (d. 40H/661AD), cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, and fourth caliph. \u02bfAl\u012b was an acknowledged master of Arabic eloquence and a renowned sage of Islamic wisdom. Through proverbs and aphorisms, sermons and speeches, prayers and supplications, epistles and contracts, testimonials and homilies, verse and dialogues, it provides instruction on how to be a decent human being. And it combines these ethical teachings with religious exhortations and preparation for eternal life in the hereafter. Moreover, the lessons of the text are clothed in the cadenced parallelisms of a consummate oral culture, and the vivid metaphors of the Arabian desert. Appealing to the addressee\u2019s  higher nature, they also beguile his aesthetic sensibilities, integrating art and edification in an exquisite package of verbal ingenuity.     Of the many compilations of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words, A Treasury of Virtues arguably possesses the broadest compass of genres, and the largest variety of themes. The shorter One Hundred Proverbs is also a compilation of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words. Attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 (\u201cthe father of Arabic prose\u201d), it has a celebrity status in its own category and its pithy one-liners are quotable quotes of the finest order. This volume presents the first English translation of both these important texts, with a new critical edition based on several original manuscripts.

Oh, woe is he!      The poet&rsquo;s affliction is a familiar one, but his identity&mdash;to English readers, at least&mdash;might come as a surprise. He was not a chivalrous Arthurian knight or lovesick Elizabethan dandy, but rather the 8th-century bard Dhu l-Rummah, considered by Arabic scholars to be the last of the great Islamic Bedouin desert poets. Reflecting on tribal politics, the rigors of desert life, and, of course, the agonies of love, Dhu l-Rummah and his predecessors&mdash;beginning in the 6th century, with an oral tradition stretching back even earlier&mdash;developed a system of meter and rhyme as complex as anything within the European literary canon.       But owing to the difficulty of translation, this poetry has remained, like most premodern Arabic   works, virtually unknown to English readers. For the nonfluent, fleeting encounters with Arabic    literature have historically come in the form of translations of the Koran or, perhaps, hackneyed   adaptations of stories from One Thousand and One Nights . But these small tastes are hardly   representative of a rich literary tradition that includes everything from theological treatises    to ribald tales. Now, a group of scholars led by Philip F. Kennedy, associate professor of Middle   Eastern and Islamic studies, has set out to fill that gap by building a comprehensive library of    classical Arabic works. The Library of Arabic Literature (LAL)&mdash;an NYU Abu Dhabi Intitute    project&mdash;will present some 35 volumes ranging from pre-Islamic poetry to a 19th-century     proto-novel with Arabic alongside the English translation on facing pages.              Producing new editions  involves the painstaking work  of tracking down and studying original manuscripts.           The first book in the series, an anthology of classic works selected and translated by University of Oxford Arabic professor emeritus Geert Jan van Gelder, was released in December. Two others&mdash; A Treasury of Virtues , a collection of sayings and teachings attributed to &rsquo;Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad, and 9th-century  legal scholar Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi&rsquo;i&rsquo;s The Epistle on Legal Theory , believed to be the oldest surviving document on Islamic jurisprudence&mdash;followed in February. &ldquo;Part of our aim for the series is to publish broadly in the various different fields that constitute Arabic heritage: literature, belles lettres, law, history, biography, travel literature, geographical literature, theology&mdash;a broad array of what was written back in the premodern era,&rdquo; says Chip Rossetti, managing editor of the series, which is being published by NYU Press.   The series may be read as a response in part to a recent uptick in interest among English readers, post-9/11, in the language and culture of the Arabic world. Kennedy and Rossetti envision that one day it may serve as a kind of Arabic analogue to Harvard University Press&rsquo;s renowned Loeb Classical Library of Greek and Latin literature&mdash;the idea being that future generations of English readers will now be able to study the Arabic classics alongside Homer and Cicero.   The first offering, van Gelder&rsquo;s anthology, Classical Arabic Literature , provides a sampling of the wide array of themes and genres that will be covered in the larger series, including wine poems, popular science, and even erotica. Though the authors  of the pieces in the anthology lived hundreds of years ago, Rossetti notes that their chosen &ldquo;topics are also very recognizable: love, petty annoyances, human relations.&rdquo;   Some of the works, such as Egyptian writer Ahmad al-Tifashi&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Young Girl and the Dough Kneader,&rdquo; which van Gelder describes as a &ldquo;moderately pornographic&rdquo; story designed to &ldquo;simulate the girl&rsquo;s breathless monologue,&rdquo; will no doubt raise eyebrows&mdash;which the editors paused to consider. &ldquo;Some readers might prefer not to encounter the bawdy and erotic in a representation of Arabic literature,&rdquo; Kennedy says. &ldquo;We just want, and feel obligated, to be honest.&rdquo;    Because most of the works to be included in the LAL series date from before the dawn of printing in   Arabic, producing new editions involves the painstaking work of tracking down and studying original   manuscripts. An eight-member editorial board of Arabic and Islamic studies scholars from various    universities meets twice a year to oversee the selection, editing, and translation of these texts.   Some stories might seem familiar: &ldquo;A Visit to Heaven and Hell,&rdquo; an excerpt from the    satirical The Epistle of Forgiveness by 11th-century writer Abu  l-&rsquo;Ala&rsquo; al-Ma&rsquo;arri, is considered by some as a forerunner to Dante&rsquo;s Divine Comedy .    Al-Ma&rsquo;arri&rsquo;s work has contemporary resonance as well. The writer&rsquo;s Syrian homeland has been in the news a lot lately. &ldquo;We hear about the Arab Spring, but it&rsquo;s important to balance political news with more of this,&rdquo; Kennedy says. That&rsquo;s not to say that Arabic literature can provide easy answers to thorny 21st-century questions about power and peace. Rossetti warns against the tendency to &ldquo;read Arabic as sort of a sociological text&mdash;as something that can inform contemporary politics.&rdquo; Instead, he says, the series will have succeeded when people begin reading Arabic literature the way they read Russian or French poetry and prose in translation&mdash;&rdquo;as real literature with its own merits.&rdquo; Kennedy shares the sentiment:  &ldquo;I envision the series being a physical thing, where you can walk into a bookstore and see those rows of books&mdash;and people can see that there&rsquo;s this huge tradition.&rdquo;"}]},

a library of the classic works of Arabic Islamic literature and culture in parallel-text editions -- Arabic and English running texts on facing pages. The translations, which will be produced in a clear, modern idiom, will be accessible by general readers and academics alike. LAL will be a standing project with the long-term goal of translating a substantial library in the coming years. The project includes an international editorial board of leading Arabic scholars from around the world, each of whom will discuss their work at public workshops and lectures at NYU Abu Dhabi and other Abu Dhabi schools.

Like many pre-modern Arabic anthologies it aims at being both entertaining and informative. It ranges from the early Bedouin poems with their evocation of desert life to refined urban lyrical verse, from tender love poetry to sonorous eulogy or vicious lampoons, and from the heights of mystical rapture to the frivolity of comic verse. The prose contains anecdotes, entertaining or edifying tales and parables, a fairy-tale, a bawdy story, samples of literary criticism, and much more.     With this anthology, distinguished Arabist Geert Jan van Gelder brings together well-known texts as well as less familiar pieces that will be new even to scholars in the field. Many recent studies and anthologies of Middle Eastern literatures are primarily interested in Islam and religious matters\u2014an emphasis that leads to the common misconception that almost everything in the region was and is dominated by religion. Classical Arabic Literature instead brings to life the rich variety of pre-modern Arabic social and cultural life, where secular texts happily coexisted with religious ones. This masterful anthology, in English only, will introduce this vibrant literary heritage to a wide spectrum of new readers.     _______   Geert Jan van Gelder was Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford from 1998 to 2012. He is the author of several books on classical Arabic literature, including Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem and Of Dishes and Discourse: Classical Arabic Literary Representations of Food .                                 The Epistle on Legal Theory            Al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b   Edited and translated by Joseph E. Lowry     The Epistle on Legal Theory is the oldest surviving Arabic work on Islamic legal theory and the foundational document of Islamic jurisprudence. Its author, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b (d.204H / 820AD), was the eponymous founder of the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b legal school, one of the four rites in Sunni Islam. This fascinating work offers the first systematic treatment in Arabic of key issues in Islamic legal thought. These include a survey of the importance of Arabic as the language of revelation, principles of textual interpretation to be applied to the Qur\u2019an and prophetic Traditions, techniques for harmonizing apparently contradictory precedents, legal epistemology, rules of inference, and situations in which legal interpretation is required. The author illustrates his theoretical claims with numerous examples drawn from nearly all areas of Islamic law, including ritual, commercial law, tort law, and criminal law.     The text thus provides an important window into both Islamic law and legal thought generally and early Islamic intellectual history in particular. The Arabic text has been established on the basis of the two most important critical editions and includes variants in the notes, while the English text is a new translation by a leading scholar of Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b and his thought. The Epistle on Legal Theory represents one of the earliest complete works on Islamic law, one that is centrally important for the formation of Islamic legal thought and the Islamic legal tradition.     ________   Joseph E. Lowry is Associate Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. His books include Early Islamic Legal Theory: The Ris\u0101la of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b . His research and publications focus on the Qur\u2019an, Islamic law, and Arabic literature. Before becoming an academic he was an attorney in private practice in Washington, D.C.                                   A Treasury of Virtues: Sayings, Sermons and Teachings of \u02bfAl\u012b with the One Hundred Proverbs, attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93            Al-Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b al-Qu\u1e0d\u0101\u02bf\u012b     Edited and translated by Tahe ra Qutbuddin     A Treasury of Virtues is a collection of sayings, sermons, and teachings attributed to \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib (d. 40H/661AD), cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, and fourth caliph. \u02bfAl\u012b was an acknowledged master of Arabic eloquence and a renowned sage of Islamic wisdom. Through proverbs and aphorisms, sermons and speeches, prayers and supplications, epistles and contracts, testimonials and homilies, verse and dialogues, it provides instruction on how to be a decent human being. And it combines these ethical teachings with religious exhortations and preparation for eternal life in the hereafter. Moreover, the lessons of the text are clothed in the cadenced parallelisms of a consummate oral culture, and the vivid metaphors of the Arabian desert. Appealing to the addressee\u2019s  higher nature, they also beguile his aesthetic sensibilities, integrating art and edification in an exquisite package of verbal ingenuity.     Of the many compilations of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words, A Treasury of Virtues arguably possesses the broadest compass of genres, and the largest variety of themes. The shorter One Hundred Proverbs is also a compilation of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words. Attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 (\u201cthe father of Arabic prose\u201d), it has a celebrity status in its own category and its pithy one-liners are quotable quotes of the finest order. This volume presents the first English translation of both these important texts, with a new critical edition based on several original manuscripts.

Oh, woe is he!      The poet&rsquo;s affliction is a familiar one, but his identity&mdash;to English readers, at least&mdash;might come as a surprise. He was not a chivalrous Arthurian knight or lovesick Elizabethan dandy, but rather the 8th-century bard Dhu l-Rummah, considered by Arabic scholars to be the last of the great Islamic Bedouin desert poets. Reflecting on tribal politics, the rigors of desert life, and, of course, the agonies of love, Dhu l-Rummah and his predecessors&mdash;beginning in the 6th century, with an oral tradition stretching back even earlier&mdash;developed a system of meter and rhyme as complex as anything within the European literary canon.       But owing to the difficulty of translation, this poetry has remained, like most premodern Arabic   works, virtually unknown to English readers. For the nonfluent, fleeting encounters with Arabic    literature have historically come in the form of translations of the Koran or, perhaps, hackneyed   adaptations of stories from One Thousand and One Nights . But these small tastes are hardly   representative of a rich literary tradition that includes everything from theological treatises    to ribald tales. Now, a group of scholars led by Philip F. Kennedy, associate professor of Middle   Eastern and Islamic studies, has set out to fill that gap by building a comprehensive library of    classical Arabic works. The Library of Arabic Literature (LAL)&mdash;an NYU Abu Dhabi Intitute    project&mdash;will present some 35 volumes ranging from pre-Islamic poetry to a 19th-century     proto-novel with Arabic alongside the English translation on facing pages.              Producing new editions  involves the painstaking work  of tracking down and studying original manuscripts.           The first book in the series, an anthology of classic works selected and translated by University of Oxford Arabic professor emeritus Geert Jan van Gelder, was released in December. Two others&mdash; A Treasury of Virtues , a collection of sayings and teachings attributed to &rsquo;Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin and son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad, and 9th-century  legal scholar Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi&rsquo;i&rsquo;s The Epistle on Legal Theory , believed to be the oldest surviving document on Islamic jurisprudence&mdash;followed in February. &ldquo;Part of our aim for the series is to publish broadly in the various different fields that constitute Arabic heritage: literature, belles lettres, law, history, biography, travel literature, geographical literature, theology&mdash;a broad array of what was written back in the premodern era,&rdquo; says Chip Rossetti, managing editor of the series, which is being published by NYU Press.   The series may be read as a response in part to a recent uptick in interest among English readers, post-9/11, in the language and culture of the Arabic world. Kennedy and Rossetti envision that one day it may serve as a kind of Arabic analogue to Harvard University Press&rsquo;s renowned Loeb Classical Library of Greek and Latin literature&mdash;the idea being that future generations of English readers will now be able to study the Arabic classics alongside Homer and Cicero.   The first offering, van Gelder&rsquo;s anthology, Classical Arabic Literature , provides a sampling of the wide array of themes and genres that will be covered in the larger series, including wine poems, popular science, and even erotica. Though the authors  of the pieces in the anthology lived hundreds of years ago, Rossetti notes that their chosen &ldquo;topics are also very recognizable: love, petty annoyances, human relations.&rdquo;   Some of the works, such as Egyptian writer Ahmad al-Tifashi&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Young Girl and the Dough Kneader,&rdquo; which van Gelder describes as a &ldquo;moderately pornographic&rdquo; story designed to &ldquo;simulate the girl&rsquo;s breathless monologue,&rdquo; will no doubt raise eyebrows&mdash;which the editors paused to consider. &ldquo;Some readers might prefer not to encounter the bawdy and erotic in a representation of Arabic literature,&rdquo; Kennedy says. &ldquo;We just want, and feel obligated, to be honest.&rdquo;    Because most of the works to be included in the LAL series date from before the dawn of printing in   Arabic, producing new editions involves the painstaking work of tracking down and studying original   manuscripts. An eight-member editorial board of Arabic and Islamic studies scholars from various    universities meets twice a year to oversee the selection, editing, and translation of these texts.   Some stories might seem familiar: &ldquo;A Visit to Heaven and Hell,&rdquo; an excerpt from the    satirical The Epistle of Forgiveness by 11th-century writer Abu  l-&rsquo;Ala&rsquo; al-Ma&rsquo;arri, is considered by some as a forerunner to Dante&rsquo;s Divine Comedy .    Al-Ma&rsquo;arri&rsquo;s work has contemporary resonance as well. The writer&rsquo;s Syrian homeland has been in the news a lot lately. &ldquo;We hear about the Arab Spring, but it&rsquo;s important to balance political news with more of this,&rdquo; Kennedy says. That&rsquo;s not to say that Arabic literature can provide easy answers to thorny 21st-century questions about power and peace. Rossetti warns against the tendency to &ldquo;read Arabic as sort of a sociological text&mdash;as something that can inform contemporary politics.&rdquo; Instead, he says, the series will have succeeded when people begin reading Arabic literature the way they read Russian or French poetry and prose in translation&mdash;&rdquo;as real literature with its own merits.&rdquo; Kennedy shares the sentiment:  &ldquo;I envision the series being a physical thing, where you can walk into a bookstore and see those rows of books&mdash;and people can see that there&rsquo;s this huge tradition.&rdquo;"}, {"content": "Course Offerings    | MEIS | NYU                                                                Back to  previous page                                Course Offerings Language Courses Note: Language examinations are held before the first week of the fall and spring semesters and on a regular basis during the academic year.
