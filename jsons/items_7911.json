Other research is focused on the phylogenetic relationships among organisms using molecular tools. Researchers in this area have initiated strong working relationships with NYU's Department of Anthropology , the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) , the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) , and the NYC Aquarium . The investigators from these institutions have affiliated appointments in the NYU Biology Department. One of these alliances is the BRIDGES track, which provides a rare opportunity for students to study evolutionary mechanisms in a wide range of organisms. Regular Regional Molecular Evolution Meetings bring together molecular evolutionists from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania to discuss their research and share ideas.
