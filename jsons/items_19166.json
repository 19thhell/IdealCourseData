A successful employee is reliable, listens carefully, works diligently, and ensures that all sensitive information is kept confidential. Confidential information regarding students, alumni, employees, parents, and all departmental activities and correspondence should not be shared with NYU students or the community. In addition, NYU supervisors expect that all student employees work well with others, make contributions to the department, and maintain a positive attitude.          NYU myTime   NYU myTime is a University-wide, web-based timekeeping system that provides NYU with a system for tracking time worked, time off balances, and work study balances (if applicable).

While NYU CareerNet lists many available positions. It is not the only way to find and secure employment. We encourage all students interested in working on-campus to call, email, or visit NYU employers of interest to see if they have any openings available.              Register to Work On Campus     On-Campus Employment forms and instructions are available by logging onto Albert and selecting &quot; Wasserman On-Campus Student Employment Registration &quot; at the bottom-right of the screen.   You will need to complete the Initial Appointment Form B on Albert and visit the Wasserman Center in person to have your forms approved, if:     You have NOT worked at NYU before   It has been more than three years since you have worked at NYU   You are a School of Engineering (SOE) student who has NOT worked at NYU/SOE since 12/31/12     You will need to submit the Reappointment Form A via Albert , but are not required to visit the Wasserman Center in person or submit another Form I-9 if:     You have worked at NYU within the past 3 years, AND are a US Citizen or Permanent Resident   You are an SOE student who has worked at NYU/SOE since January 1, 2013, AND is a US Citizen or Permanent Resident   Note: Returning international student employees must visit the office to show documentation. Acceptable documentation may be in the instructions on Albert .            Required Documents   If you have not worked at NYU before, or if it has been more than three years since you have worked at NYU, you must bring in original, signed, unexpired documents within three business days of your start date for I-9 processing. Acceptable forms of identification may be found here .   The I-9 must be completed within three business days of your start date. If you do not have the documents handy within that time frame, you cannot work. Therefore, it is important that you bring your documents with you when you visit the Wasserman Center to have your forms approved.     By law , the Wasserman Center is required to see original, signed, unexpired documents in person when completing our portion of the I-9. We can not accept copies under any circumstances.     New York Wage Theft Prevention Act   Effective 4/9/11, the New York Wage Theft Prevention Act amends and strengthens Section 195 of the Labor Law. Upon hire, all student employees will receive and sign a notice from the NYU hiring department. This notice will include employer information, the employee's rate of pay, frequency of pay, and overtime pay rate.          Professional Expectations   Similar to jobs and internships, professional behavior is expected for all on-campus positions. A successful employee is reliable, listens carefully, works diligently, and ensures that all sensitive information is kept confidential. Confidential information regarding students, alumni, employees, parents, and all departmental activities and correspondence should not be shared with NYU students or the community. In addition, NYU supervisors expect that all student employees work well with others, make contributions to the department, and maintain a positive attitude.          NYU myTime   NYU myTime is a University-wide, web-based timekeeping system that provides NYU with a system for tracking time worked, time off balances, and work study balances (if applicable). It provides administrators, staff, and hourly student employees with online access to vacation, sick, and personal time balances. You should follow the clock in / out procedures designated by the school / unit in which you work.       For additional information about myTime including FAQs, training, schedules, etc. please visit the myTime website and review the myTime guide .                                              On-Campus Employment        FAQs                                                 Finding Part-Time Work                                                                  Eligibility   Students must be enrolled in a minimum of three (3) credits OR have Full-Time Equivalency to be eligible for On Campus Student Employment.   Earnings     Student employment positions' hourly salaries vary based on a number of factors, including: the hiring department's budget, the student's number of hours worked, the student's current Federal Work-Study funds, etc. Student employment positions pay a minimum of $8.75 per hour, which is the current NY State minimum wage. On average, most student employment positions pay $9-15 per hour. Graduate and Doctoral student pay can reach up to $40+/hour.   Hours   When classes are in session students may work up to 20 hours per week. When classes are not in session (i.e. Winter Break, Spring Break, and Summer Break) students may work up to 35 hours per week, which is the standard NYU full-time work week.   Students are allowed to hold multiple positions on campus, but may not exceed the maximum hours allowed per week as described above.   Receiving Your Paycheck   Student employees are paid bi-weekly and are strongly encouraged to use NYU Payroll's direct deposit , as it is the fastest, most convenient, and most secure way to receive payroll. Note: this is separate from the Bursar's tuition reimbursement direct deposit enrollment . As an alternative, student employee paychecks can be distributed to your supervisor at your NYU department.   It is extremely important that you give a copy of your approved On Campus Student Employee Application to your supervisor as soon as possible, because it contains vital information that they will need to enter you into NYU's Payroll system. From the time that your supervisor submits your paperwork for processing, it generally takes 4-6 weeks before you receive your first check               Contact Us     Main Office   133 East 13th Street, 2nd Floor  (212) 998-4730 | career.development@nyu.edu     Brooklyn Office   311 Bridge Street (The Wunsch Building)  (718) 260-3650 | career.development@nyu.edu   School of Professional Studies Office   7 East 12th Street, Suite 829  (212) 998-7205 | sps.wasserman@nyu.edu   www.sps.nyu.edu/career     Meet our staff                  Follow Us                                                                                        NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

What happens after I submit my application and resume in the system?                                                       Once your application is in the system, it will be reviewed by the recruitment team or the hiring supervisor or manager from the respective unit with the vacancy. You will hear from the hiring department directly should they be interested in setting up an interview. Due to the high volume of resumes we receive, it is not possible to respond directly to all applicants, only to those whose candidacy is being pursued. In addition, the length of the recruitment process varies based on the unit\u2019s needs. Traditionally, the process takes approximately 2-8 weeks Therefore, your patience is greatly appreciated.                                                                                                                                                                            How long do you keep applications on file?                                                       Your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for job opportunities for one year.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grant-funded position?                                                       A grant-funded job is based upon funding from an agency external to New York University and is therefore contingent on the agency's continued support at a full level of funding throughout the duration of the appointment. If a position is grant-funded, it will be noted in the job posting on our website.

Academic positions (faculty and research scientists) are advertised in a variety of venues (e.g., The Chronicle of Higher Education, The New York Times, professional journals) by individual schools and/or academic departments within NYU. Therefore, all inquiries should be directed specifically to the appropriate school or department.

Apply for Jobs @ nyucareers.com                                With NYU's automated application system, the process for applying for jobs is fast and efficient.     Within the application you have the opportunity to &quot;cut and paste&quot; your resume and cover letter or upload your resume into the system.   Once you have completed the online application, you will receive a confirmation message. This verifies your application is now in the system.   Resumes of qualified applicants will become part of our general database for future consideration, and will enable us to review qualifications as positions become available.   If you are contacted by a Human Resources representative, you will be asked to sign the Application for Employment at the time of the interview.   Please note that the application process is competitive. Applications are screened and only those applicants who appear to most closely fit the job requirements will be contacted for interviews. In the event you are not contacted, your resume will remain active for searches in our database for consideration for other job opportunities for one year.   In addition to interviews, further screening is conducted for some positions. This may include testing for knowledge of specific software packages or extensive background investigations depending on the type of position.   Should you encounter difficulty in accessing the system or should you require any further assistance, please contact PeopleLink, NYU's new integrated service center for HR, Benefits, and Payroll inquiries, at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .   We do not accept faxed or mailed resumes.     Thank you for your interest in our &quot;commitment to excellence&quot; and applying for a position at NYU.
