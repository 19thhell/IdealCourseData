The statements were  written by the library&#39;s subject specialist librarians in consultation  with the teaching faculty. The process of writing the statements has  served to help all those involved in building the collection articulate  clear goals for its development. The ultimate goal of the Library&#39;s  collection development program is to ensure that the collection provides  strong support for the teaching and research programs of the University.  The policy statements are, therefore, not static documents. Rather,  they are revised as necessary to reflect changes in the curriculum and  the collection.

It describes the  scope of the collection, the types of materials included and excluded  and an analysis of the collection&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. The statement  also identifies other collections that complement the one in Bobst Library.  Finally, the statements list the subject areas collected and rate existing  collection strength (ECS) and current collecting intensity (CCI) according  to the following scale.

No works are acquired on   this topic or in this area with the possible exception of a few fundamental   reference works.       Level A. Basic level. This level describes a highly   selective collection, including introductory background, and fundamental   material and basic reference works, that serve to introduce and define   the subject and to indicate the varieties of information available   elsewhere. It includes major dictionaries and encyclopedias, selected   editions of important works, historical surveys, important bibliographies,   and a few major periodicals.       Level B. Study level: MA and Undergraduate. This   level is intended to support undergraduate or graduate course work,   or sustained independent study, i.e., which is adequate to maintain   knowledge of a subject required for limited or generalized purposes   of less than research intensity. It includes a wide range of basic   monographs, complete collections of the works of important writers,   selections from the works of secondary writers, a selection of representative   journals, and the reference tools and fundamental bibliographical   apparatus pertaining to the subject.       Level C. Research level. This level is intended   to support ongoing research or likely future leading to the Ph.D.   It includes the major published source materials required for dissertations   and independent research, all important reference works and a wide   selection of specialized monographs and other secondary literature   as well as an extensive collection of journals.       Level D. Advanced research level. This level is   intended to support doctoral and post-doctoral research with a high   degree of adequacy. In addition to printed and microform material,   it may include manuscripts and other special materials if they are   appropriate and within the library&#39;s financial capabilities. It allows   for indefinite expansion of the research program both at the level   of faculty and post-doctoral, and Ph.D. research.       Level E. Intensive level. This level describes   the effort to acquire so far as is reasonable all available significant   works of recorded knowledge for a necessarily defined and limited   field, i.e., an intensive effort to acquire manuscript, archival and   ephemeral materials, etc., in addition to published sources. This   level creates or maintains a special collection; the aim, if not the   achievement, is exhaustiveness.      Bobst Library participates in local, regional and national cooperative  efforts that help stretch its resources. We are fortunate to be located  in a city with incomparable library collections and we collaborate with  our colleagues at other institutions to maximize local resources. It  remains our goal, however, to build a strong local collection in those  areas that are central to the University&#39;s programs of teaching and  research. These policies serve as a plan and a tool to help us achieve  that goal.

Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This course will explore a range of issues relating to U.S. housing and community development policy, including the role housing plays in building and strengthening neighborhoods and communities. Topics to be covered are the structure of housing and related financial markets; the economic and social bases for government to intervene in these markets; and the relative merits and demerits of the different tools available to intervene in these markets including: subsidization, both directly and through the tax system; regulation of financial institutions, e.g. the Community Reinvestment Act; FHA/Ginnie Mae and government sponsored enterprises; zoning; and regulation of lands and rents. The course will also examine the role of the legal system to enforce laws and regulations and set the agenda for housing and community development policy.
