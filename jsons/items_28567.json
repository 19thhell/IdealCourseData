The Perfect Medium                      Response to Healthy Soil Microbes, Healthy People                   Recent Comments  Meta   Log in                                               Citizen Science and Documentation          Through-out this class, citizen science has been a re-occuring theme. A premise and process that we are all meant to embrace but can feel quite overwhelming at times. Our tiny apartments and lack of ideal laboratory conditions can make it feel like our ability to contribute to larger scientific knowledge is virtually impossible. Technology in general often feels like something we use but do not really understand or have the capacity to understand. Digital cameras now come equipped with hundreds of settings and filters, each one designed in a slightly different way so that as consumers we feel a perpetual lack of mastery. This creates brand loyalty, and it also creates the illusion that modern technology is beyond the layman&#8217;s understanding.   One of the most empowering aspects of this class is breaking down barriers and feeling free to experiment, construct and iterate. This is a process that is fully embedded in the ITP program but as a food studies student I think it is incredibly helpful in thinking about how we can break into what feels like impenetrable worlds of the food system and be willing to experiment with technology and other means to create new spaces, conversation and tools.   \u00a0   Also, I think documentation as practice has been an important takeaway for me in this class. No matter what we are working on, documenting the process and progress along the way is invaluable. This allows us to work more consistently and see where errors in data may exist. It is a practice that can be applied to writing a research paper, running a cheese cave, making a piece of artwork or conducting a citizen science project. The how is not as important as the consistency, where one writes it down, snaps a photo, or creates drawings. It is a skill I am still trying to master, but I leave this class with a better understanding of its value and necessity.               Posted on April 28, 2015  Author amc924                  Making Microbes Visible          Though I find the topic of microbes fascinating, I find it difficult to write about. Why? While microbial life is hugely relevant to the lives of human beings and the rest of the planet, the language of science in which the microbiome is discussed is often so dry, technical and devoid of imagination. Our interest is perhaps monetarily piqued by the scatalogical intersection or the promise of saving ourselves from ecological disaster. Our discomfort with bodily functions or the visceral reaction to the notion of our skin teeming with bugs fades in contrast to the difficult endeavor of understanding an invisible world. Is it possible to open our minds to exploring the microbial world in the same way that we were able to do with space in the 1950 and 60\u2019s?   Language is a key component in the way we talk, write and choose to study this new world. An invisible world that surrounds us can not just become a world understood in terms of how it benefits human health or will save us from natural disaster. What we are learning about microbiomes has philosophical implications much like quantum physics and the multiverse. The mere fact that we carry around three and half pounds of microbial life and that there are more microbes in a teaspoon of soil than there are people on the planet illuminates our insignificance, population-wise, as organisms. We have undoubtedly done catastrophic damage to the planet, but the microscopic world being revealed through the melting sheet of ice in the Arctic as well as California scientist is a comforting reminder that life will survive our most vehement attempts to distort the planet for human means. While I find the world of microbes mystifying, I feel skeptical that they are being seen as one more material, a commodity to be used to extend human consumption. It is the mystery of this mostly unknown world and its displacing of our human-centric viewpoint \u00a0which I find the most thought-provoking and meaningful. The task of translating mystery, through visual and other creative means, would be a far more difficult task than, at this at this point in science, sequencing a 100 dollar personal microbiome.             Posted on April 28, 2015  Author amc924                  EXPERIMENT.What does NYC tap water vs. Poland Spring bottled water do to you mouth&#8217;s microbial environment?          MOTIVATION:   Western people\u2019s consumption of heavy CO2 emitting bottled water has risen exponentially since the 1970\u2019s. My motivation for this project is to find another good reason to avoid the wasteful and expensive bottled water. That reason being related to your microbyome and health, which is exactly how these companies of the bottled water advertises their products   HYPOTHESIS:   Tap Water is more &#8220;dirty&#8221; with good microbes, making a healthier microbial environment in your mouth as well as your gut, than when drinking bottled water (Poland Spring). This would be monitored by the growth of radish seeds in the medium.   My motivation for the experiment derives from a couple of danish research and articles claiming tap water is much better quality than bottled water. But what does this exactly mean? The article refers to much lower levels of different \u00a0 when   METHOD:   Time   4 days experiment: 2 days with Poland Spring Water, 2 days with TAP water. 3 liters each day.   Consistency   Diet   As ones microbial environment in the gut and the mouth (as well as the microbyome) is strongly related to your diet, I wanted to ensure as much consistency as possible in my diet in the days I was swabbing my mouth. In the below schema my diet is shown.   Experiment   Since I want to measure something very particular, my mouths bacteria\u2019s influence on the growth of radish seeds, I want to be as much clear from contaminators and varying external conditions, such as temperature and light. Therefore I cleaned each tool and material I used in the experiment, including my hands.   Conclusion:   The experiment has not yet evolved the set of bacteria that was expected to be seen in the mediums. The radish seeds on the other side, is sprouting in all mediums with seemingly same pace. The experiment\u2019s results will depend on the following days growth of the bacteria and how these are going to affect the continuing growth of the radish seeds.             Posted on April 27, 2015  Author Nikolaj Petersen                  The Perfect Medium          Background &amp; Thesis:   The importance of soil in food production and security is receiving national and global momentum. The United Nations designated the year 2015 as the \u201cYear of Soils\u201d to bring awareness on the important role soil undertakes in maintaining food production, mitigating climate control, ensuring food security, along with a host of other reasons. Composting is an excellent tool to provide depleted soils with necessary amendments that feed both the plant and the soil. Generating awareness and support is necessary for the success of these municipal initiatives and this project intends to incorporate art, science, and food waste to indicate the beauty of decomposition and the benefits healthy soil has on our planet and selves.   I propose that soil with high microbial activity content should be the best medium for growing plants, with higher germination and seedling survival rates, that there will be different microbial formations that can be used as a tool to explain the beauty of the bounty of microbes in soil.   Process (additional procedural material available):   For the experiment I used an Tryptic Soy Agar mixture and the four different types of soil: compost from a vermiculture bin, a sample from New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park, potting soil from Crest Hardware, and sterilized potting soil.   Soil as the medium:     Measure two tablespoons of each soil type, twice, in and place separately in each petri dish   Spray 5 times with sterile water.   With sterile tweezers, place six seeds of Basil and in a separate dish, six seeds of Echinacea for each soil sample (totaling eight petri dishes \u2013 2 per swab)   Mist each petri dish 5 times with sterile water. Repeat every morning for five days.   Close and keep in dark place (basil seeds on top)     Agar as the medium:     One tablespoon of soil mixed with two tablespoons of purified water   Spread the liquid evenly over agar mixture using sterile pipet   With sterile tweezers, place six seeds of Basil and in a separate dish, six seeds of Echinacea for each soil swab (totaling eight petri dishes \u2013 2 per swab)   Close and place in dark place, upside-down (basil seeds on top) \u00a0     Conclusions :     Variations in seed growth \u2013 NYC parks soil and compost had quickest germination rates \u2013 basil in three days and Echinacea in four.   Variations in bacteria growth\u2013 potting soil had bulbous growth while soil that had been exposed to live microbial growth   Increased microbial activity (with moisture levels controlled as best as possible) allows for quicker germination rate and water retention for some seeds. Basil was more receptive to compost and NYC parks seeds while Echinacea seeds thrived in the sterile and potting soil.     Future Research/Application:   Incorporate micro and macro imagery of soil into a social media and educational campaign \u201cSoil: Larger Than Life.\u201d Connect the microscopic with the bigger picture via narratives and images.             Posted on April 26, 2015  Author abb395                  Response to Healthy Soil Microbes, Healthy People          One of the things that Amaranthus et. al. uncover in their article, I find to be yet another terrifying exemple of the human paradigmatic exploitation of nature. Advanced science in bio chemistry has made western agriculture able to streamline production resulting in larger yields when using production methods like Round UP as well as monocropping.\u00a0   I wonder what they must have thought when they introduced the new wonder drug of crops. &#8220;Lower production costs, lower prices on consumer products, everybody wins. This is too good to be true\u201d &#8211; And it was.\u00a0   Now that we have become used to get our hamburgers, corn sirup soda and mac n cheese at prices that has been unnaturally dumped, there is no way back, as maintaining these prices (as well as production methods) is essential to business\u00b4s existence.   But the result of decades with agricultural standards as exemplified above, is now showing ist ugly face. Decreases in yields, assumedly gluten intolerance, obesity, etc.\u00a0   And in contrast to issues with climate change, which often cannot be seen in our everyday life, the consequences of deflated soil, a widespread issue in western society agriculture, seems to be much more present and tangible as previously thought.   As awareness of these issues has appeared in our (scientific) conversations, same advanced science is finally being funded towards sustainability. One of the discoveries is microbiological maintenance in soil by adding certain cultures.   Nikolaj             Posted on April 21, 2015  Author Nikolaj Petersen                  Fermentation: both a savior and a trap          It\u2019s interesting to reflect upon how disturbing it strikes us (generalizing from the reactions in the articles) to eat cheese made from breast milk or use cultures (bacteria) derived from humans for cheesemaking, but we regularly eat cheese made from animal milk using a variety of animal derivatives in the process. I tend to have the same reactions, despite how illogical they are \u2013 though I suppose the same argument could be made for meat and the idea that we eat meat of other animals. Yet the fact remains that we are the only species that eats another\u2019s milk and its derivatives, whereas plenty of species eat others\u2019 meat. Perhaps the link into making this unique practice reconcilable was, as the article about cheese points out, the fermentation \u2013 it allows even those who are lactose intolerant to benefit nutritionally from animal milk\u2019s fat, calories, and protein. As a cheese lover, I appreciate the idea that cheese and similar dairy foods had a special role to play in the evolution of how humans ate, bridging the gap from a food that would otherwise be challenging for many of us to enjoy (fluid milk) into one of the great earthly delights that bacteria and fermentation can bring us (cheese).   As we consider joys of fermentation, however, it is important to also consider potential risks. In both the articles about cheese and kombucha, the issue of food safety and good bacteria winning out over bad came up, as well as the \u201cmagical elixir\u201d principles championed by the proponents of each, particularly raw cheese as opposed to pasteurized. Although I tend to agree with proponents that warnings about food safety in this context can easily be overblown at a major cost to taste and possibly health, I proceed with caution when it comes to these issues. The kombucha expert pointed out that sloppy, dirty kombucha production can yield a harmful brew \u2013 just as sloppy cheese production can. I worry sometimes, in the context of a wholehearted, unfettered embrace of all things fermented, that adherents will miss the memo about cleanliness. The good cheesemakers I know, especially those working with raw cheeses, are also the most obsessive cleaners I know; cleaning and sanitizing the cheesemaking rooms and equipment takes as much time as the cheesemaking itself. As recent listeria outbreaks have shown us, food contamination is real and can cause major harm. Artisanal producers are not immune to risk, just as industrial producers are not, and must take just as many precautions to produce safe food. Raw-milk and similar fans should be aware of these risks and know their producers well before trusting them, because even well-meaning producers who don\u2019t have the right training cannot, with just their belief in fermentation, fight off the worst of the pathogens.             Posted on April 19, 2015  Author jab988                  Human Cheese &amp; Funky Tea          If they made cheese out of me, I\u2019d want it to be cheddar\u2026   Making cheese from bacteria derived from the human body is really fascinating because, as biologist Christina Agapakis mentions, it forces people to rethink their relationships with microorganisms. Some of the microbes present in cheese are in fact very similar to the ones found in places on the human body, such as feet. Making cheese from humans is slightly disgusting, but Agapakis points out that this is not cheese made for eating, but for thinking. Hopefully, people will begin to better appreciate microbes and just how complex and wonderful a piece of cheese really is.   The Science of Cheese Is Weirder Than You Think highlights just some of the intricacies of the cheese world. Cheese is commonly understood to be a value-added product, in that the fermenting of milk creates a more nutritious and lasting food. What I find most interesting is the concept of terroir , the French word for \u201cland.\u201d Terroir is an important characteristic of cheese in that the flavor of the cheese, depending on the climate, season, and bacteria involved, can be so distinct, even if the variety of cheese is the same.   Now, on the Kombucha\u2026   Kombucha, a drink made from fermented tea, is thought to have really great health benefits including aiding in digestion as well as boosting the immune system. The article Kombucha: Magical Health Elixir or Just Funky Tea , by Patti Neighmond, takes a skeptical view of the drink, claiming that its benefits are yet to be proven and yet it is becoming a more and more popular beverage. I have been drinking Kombucha for a while, admittedly for the taste and if there really are all these great benefits, than that\u2019s just a plus. Considering, however, the increasing studies that emphasize the importance of healthy gut microbes, I would think Kombucha is a little more than just \u201cfunky tea.\u201d             Posted on April 19, 2015  Author lam639                  feeding our soil, feeding our planet          What would we be if we applied the \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d mantra to the core of our food system, soil? Would our bodies resemble a small industrial chemical factory? The many public conversations that address the myriad of problems in the food system and effecting public health have fallen short on the importance of soil health and the long-term implications for our food web and bodies. The notion by the Irish artists to use biases in taste and acceptable microbes in food could be applied to educate about soil health.   The current soil and crop management environment is spraying fertilizers to feed the plants and blanket application of herbicides and pesticides to manage weeds, pests, and other \u201cnoxious\u201d life forms. Almost all life is eradicated in these chemical applications with consequences that could have long-lasting effects on the micro and macro environment that are yet to be fully understood.   What constitutes healthy soil? Healthy soil requires microbial activity and humus facilitates that life underground. Biodiversity of microbes in the soil can help deter pests and pathogens and improve the general soil structure. The use of organic material contributes to good tilth (associated with soil composition), which also has many environmental and agricultural benefits. Good tilth of the soil and soil organic material aid in water absorption- using the microscopic holes in the soil make-up to store water for later use. The humus is more absorbent than many other elements used in soil composition, like sand, while providing sufficient nutrients and minerals to the roots of the plants. These nutrients are then transferred to animals and humans through consumption of said plants.   Soil microorganisms have a huge role in ecosystem maintenance. In addition to improving water absorption and the improved nutrient access to plants and animals, microbial activity has been associated with soil erosion prevention, aiding in water filtration, and even as a means to sequester carbon. By destroying these microscopic ecosystems we are eliminating a regulatory body that has been around for millions of years.   To connect the importance of soil health to the implications on our food, scientists and artists can conduct a similar exhibit using the techniques used by the Irish artists. This could be used as a tool to educate variation between healthy and unhealthy soils via microbial inoculation to cheeses. Some cheeses could be cured with microbes found in healthy soil, rich in organic matter and thus microbial activity, and others with soil that receives consistent application of fertilizers (and likely other chemicals) and has little to no microbial activity. The variation in smells, appearances, and likely textures will visually illuminate the stark differences between healthy soil and dead soil. I imagine few individuals would consider tasting a cheese that has been inoculated with microbes from soil that received a healthy dose of roundup a few weeks earlier.   The artistic application of healthy versus unhealthy soil could also help generate conversations on what is happening to our soils in a tangible manner. Smelling, feeling, and seeing the differences can allow people to connect to the realities of our agricultural system and hopefully, create movement to demand greater stewardship of our soils.             Posted on April 16, 2015  Author abb395                  Week 4 Response          The article, \u201cGut Punch: Monsanto Could be Destroying your Microbiome,\u201d by Tom Laskawy looked at the possible effects of Monsanto\u2019s Roundup not just as having a direct impact on human cells and our health, but as having a more direct impact on the microbes inside us and the health of our microbiome. This is an interesting approach, and perhaps not as straightforward, because studies that strive to link the health of our microbiota to our overall health is relatively new. Laskaway argues that we are just beginning to understand our microbiome and its connection with disease prevention. While humans may not be absorbing Roundup when ingested, it is suggested that we are exposing our microbes to it, many of which can have their metabolic processes disrupted by the chemical. This article was written in response to recent legislation that increases the allowable limits of Roundup residue on our food as well as on animal feed. What has always confounded me is this: why does there always seem to be an \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d ideology inherit in the GRA (generally regarded as safe) label blessed by the FDA? How could allowable limits of chemicals be increased at a time when evidence suggesting that these chemicals can disrupt the health of our microbiome, which ultimately impacts our overall health, is growing?   In \u201cMicrobes Will Feed the World, or Why Real Farmers Grow Soil, Not Crops,\u201d Brian Barth suggests soil rich in beneficial microbes can be the sustainable solution to feeding the 9 billion humans that are expected to populate the Earth by 2050, which will require farmers to increase their yields by 70 to 100 percent. My question is this: assuming it were possible to produce tons more food by harnessing the power of microbes, would our global economy allow the food to reach the people it needs to reach, considering that so much food currently goes to waste because allowing it to enter the market would jeopardize prices?   The research presented in \u201cPanda Poop Microbes Could Make Biofuels of the Future\u201d proposed that many of the microbes present in the feces of the Giant Panda could be used to easily and inexpensively break down plant waste for ethanol production. Pandas have a relatively short digestive track, and thus they require microbes that can efficiently and quickly break down the lignocellulose present in bamboo, microbes that could be used to break down plant waste such as cornhusks.   The Smithsonian article titled, \u201cA New Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Resistant Bacteria\u201d suggests that microbes found in soil, such as teixobactin, can efficiently ward off harmful, disease-causing bacteria without wrecking havoc on the human microbiome. The article also suggests that it would take decades before pathogens would be able to develop a resistance to them. I wonder how feasible introducing such antibiotics into the market would be without heavy resistance and retaliation from the pharmaceutical industry\u2026   &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;   For my project, I will be testing the effects of various sweeteners on the health of microbes. This will be done by preparing several Petri dishes will an agar solution, each one containing a different type of sweetener, such as honey (local versus processed), sugar (white, refined versus minimally processed cane), high fructose corn syrup, and artificially sweeteners (Splenda and Sweet N\u2019 Low). I do not want to introduce too many variables into this project by testing too many ingredients, but I am really interested to see how each sweetener affects the growth and health of each microbial community (this will be tested according to how well seeds can sprout under the different conditions and what types of microbes will be present). I am particularly interested in seeing the effects on the dishes containing the artificially sweeteners considering how many people opt to use them in their diets in an attempt to avoid sugar thinking they are a more healthful option.             Posted on April 12, 2015  Author lam639                  Response to &#8220;A New Antibiotic Found in Dirt Can Kill Drug-Res&#8230;&#8221;          An interesting thing to point out in the article A new Antibiotic can kill Drug resistant Bacteria is, that the finding of the antibiotic was a result of very simple idea that didn\u2019t require 100\u2019s of hours of research by expensive paid scientist.\u00a0   Because it is so hard to match the environment conditions that allows for certain bacterias growth in a laboratory, why dont just bring the experiment and cultivation to the natural conditions that we know the bacterias are multiplying in.\u00a0   This example shows, that sometimes, a simple idea and a motivation to \u2018hack\u2019 one\u2019s way to a result, can be the driver for a significant finding, potentially representing a solution to overcome the problem with multi resistant bacteria.\u00a0   /Nikolaj             Posted on April 12, 2015  Author Nikolaj Petersen              Posts navigation     Page 1   Page 2   Page 3   Next page                             Proudly powered by WordPress"}]}]
