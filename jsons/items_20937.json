This course introduces a selection of key ideas, experiences, and planning practices that shaped the contemporary city, and those that contend to shape the future city. In a lecture-seminar format, it examines important cases drawn from major cities around the world such as Mumbai, Paris, New York, Shanghai, and Detroit. Topics include megacities and megaslums, sustainable cities, \"cybercities,\" and some of the most important planning interventions and visions from the past. The aim of the course is three-fold: To develop a critical reading of a selection of urban spaces, planning efforts, and texts; to provide a vocabulary of some of the major urban plans, ideas, and spaces: and to identify crucial issues that planners and designers now confront.

Her research is on cognition and learning in commercial entertainment games and games designed for impact. In 2011-2012, she served as Senior Policy Analyst in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) where she advised on national initiatives related to games. Policy work there included the coordination of cross-agency efforts to leverage games toward national priority areas (e.g. childhood obesity, early literacy, STEM education) and the creation of new partnerships to support an ecosystem for more diversified innovation in commercial and non-commercial games. She also played a central role in recent meetings through the Vice President&rsquo;s office on videogames and violence.    Constance&rsquo;s current research interests include neuroscience and games (particularly in the areas of attention and emotional and social well-being), learning analytics (informal scientific reasoning, problem-solving, and the role of failure), and mixed methods (game community discourse and literacy). Her work has been funded by the MacArthur Foundation, the National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation, the Gates Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. She has published over twenty peer reviews publications on games and learning, three edited books three special issues of peer reviewed academic journals focused on the intellectual life of games, and the 2009 National Academies of Science report entitled Learning Science: Computer Games, Simulations, and Education. Current game titles under development include Tenacity and Crystals of Kaydor.
