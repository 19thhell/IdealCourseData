RUSSN-UA 810-001 COLIT-UA 810 Ostashevsky Thurs 4:55-7:25 pm Russian       Desde Cuba: Culture, Politics and Civil Society in the Last Two Cuban Decades  Dopico In the last twenty years, Cuban culture has challenged and contradicted the projects and frames of revolutions, cold wars, embargos, exiles, and exceptionalism. Beyond the sex tourism, the art exhibits, the new affluence, and state reforms, a new generation of writers, artists, filmmakers, reporters, and new cohorts of bloggers, political cartoonists, photographers, essayists, lawyers, and critics reclaim the nation and address the state, insisting on freedom of expression, the rule of law, the politics of remembering, and the notion of civil society. These persistent claims are made through videos, graffitti, newssites, blogs, cartoons, music videos, and photography, through features and documentaries, through petitions and civil actions. Although they vary in political philosophies, these new voices and artists demand both universality and contingency: an agenda of that mixes the politics of human rights, Cuban values, and the unfinished projects of the republic and the revolution. This course will examine how a new generation of Cubans, and an old-fashioned claim on the guarantees of the constitution and the socialist state are producing an extraordinary new explosion of Cuban culture. These reimagine the nation with new works and media that stress conscience, dignity, responsibility, humor, respect, self-determination, and a tenderness for citizens and national memory. We will read the blogosphere, listen to new political musical forms, including hip hop, timba and regaetton, we will look at visual art from graffitti to installations to paintings, we will consider performance art and political demonstrations, we will watch recent videos and feature films, we will read newswebsites and contemporary criticism and literature, cartoons and comedy. This will include the work of blogger Yoani Sanchez, the blogs and work of the blog site Desde Cuba, graffitti and performance artist El Sexto, musicians Silvito el libre, Eskuadron Patriota, Aldo y los Aldeanos, the video newssite Estado de Sats, the work of Antonio Jose Ponte, films like the Cuban zombie film, Juan de los muertos and videos and art from recent Havana bienals.
