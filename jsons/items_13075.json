I have written extensively on Beckett, Genet, Ionesco, Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon and the New French Novel, as well as Sartre, Camus, Duras, Cocteau, Giraudoux, and Anouilh. My current work continues my longstanding passion for Beckett, as I focus on his use of conventions, his (self)-translations, and his increasing concern with the theme of death. I also continue my interest in the relationship between realism and anti-realism, have taught a number of courses relating to this subject and view it as a major aspect of 20th century writing in French--with anti-realism increasingly the expression of modernity. I have also written on--and taught--the relationship of culture and politics in France as well as Franco-American relations. My books include Le Passeur d'oc\u00e9an--Carnets d'un ami am\u00e9ricain; From the Left Bank: Reflections on the Modern French Theater and Novel; Pirandello and the French Theater; a critical edition of Sartre's Huis clos; the Cahier de l'Herne, Samuel Beckett. For 33 years I chaired the French Department during which time I helped it become one of the great departments in the U.S. Currently as director of our Center for French Civilization and Culture, I organize conferences and numerous French cultural events, represent NYU at the meetings of some 15 leading American universities recognized by the Cultural Services if the French Embassy as Centers of Excellence, and am responsible for raising funds for these activities. I hold the Florence Gould Chair of French Literature since its creation in the 1970s.

I have written extensively on Beckett, Genet, Ionesco, Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon and the New French Novel, as well as Sartre, Camus, Duras, Cocteau, Giraudoux, and Anouilh. My current work continues my longstanding passion for Beckett, as I focus on his use of conventions, his (self)-translations, and his increasing concern with the theme of death. I also continue my interest in the relationship between realism and anti-realism, have taught a number of courses relating to this subject and view it as a major aspect of 20th century writing in French--with anti-realism increasingly the expression of modernity. I have also written on--and taught--the relationship of culture and politics in France as well as Franco-American relations. My books include Le Passeur d'oc\u00e9an--Carnets d'un ami am\u00e9ricain; From the Left Bank: Reflections on the Modern French Theater and Novel; Pirandello and the French Theater; a critical edition of Sartre's Huis clos; the Cahier de l'Herne, Samuel Beckett. For 33 years I chaired the French Department during which time I helped it become one of the great departments in the U.S. Currently as director of our Center for French Civilization and Culture, I organize conferences and numerous French cultural events, represent NYU at the meetings of some 15 leading American universities recognized by the Cultural Services if the French Embassy as Centers of Excellence, and am responsible for raising funds for these activities. I hold the Florence Gould Chair of French Literature since its creation in the 1970s.
