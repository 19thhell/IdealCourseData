Back to top    MSMS-GA 2222 Conservation and Collections Management Elective. 4 points. This seminar combines classroom discussion with museum visits to provide an understanding of preventive care, collections conservation, and collections management. It covers the historical and philosophical drive to preserve cultural objects for the future, and value conflicts that arise between professionals and non-professionals with stakes in how material culture is exhibited. The seminar addresses concerns of living artists as well as indigenous groups and others with claims to the disposition and care of cultural materials. It also covers collections management policies and procedures, including environmental management, disaster management, and collections documentation. Students perform condition assessments and conduct research leading to short writing assignments and a term paper.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 2223 Historic Sites, Cultural Landscapes and the Politics of Preservation Elective. 4 points. This course will examine the cultural politics that influence reuse of historic spaces for museums and other public purposes. Through course readings, site visits and individual archival research, students will explore sites ranging from historic houses and period rooms presented as museum installations to restored villages and communities to dramatic reuse of historic space for cultural tourism. Students will pay particular attention to the social and political contexts in which original use and subsequent reuse took place, and analyze primary documents that illustrate both motivations and strategies for interpretation. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 1 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and the Law Elective. 4 points. Legal issues pervade so many aspects of the world of museums. The law can both constrain and enable the behavior of museum staff, administration, and others who work with these cultural organizations. Therefore, it is difficult to work in, for and with museums without some training in or familiarity with the law. In this course, we will examine how museums are affected by a variety of legal regulations, including cultural heritage legislation, intellectual property issues, such as copyright, trademark and moral rights, first amendment and censorship claims, work-place hazards, contracts, and nonprofit and tax laws, such as valuation, charitable transfers, payments in lieu of taxes and the unrelated business income tax. Readings will consist of case law and secondary sources detailing the most pressing legal issues facing different types of museums, and group discussions will be supplemented by mock case studies and negotiation exercises. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 2 Topics in Museum Studies: Anthropology in and of Museums Elective. 4 points. This course considers \"the museum\" as an object of ethnographic inquiry, examining it as a social institution embedded in a broader field of cultural heritage that is perpetually under negotiation. We reflect on how museum principles of classification, practices of collection and exhibition, uptake of media, technology, and archiving have influenced the ways in which knowledge has been formed, presented, and represented; and interrogate the role of museums as significant social actors in broad anthropological debates on power, materiality, value, representation, culture, nationalism, circulation, aesthetics, science, history, and \"new\" technologies. The museum is never simply a repository of arts, cultures, histories, or scientific knowledges, but also a site of tremendous creativity and a field of complex social relations.    Relying on case studies as a springboard for discussion of broader theoretical interventions, this course is structured according to four overlapping themes. We think about museums as nodes in the traffic in art and culture, a metaphor for the transnational circulation of objects and competing regimes of value illuminating histories of colonialism, power relations, and intercultural production. Secondly, we interrogate the relationships between Indigenous people and museums, including national recognition of diversity, counter-narratives of history and belonging, performances of the other, and the intersections of Indigenous knowledge and various legal frameworks. Throughout the semester, we will think about the strategies and tools through which museums produce understandings of tangible artifacts (photographs, scientific specimens, artworks) and inspire reconsideration of preservation, archives, and memory. Finally, while the social lives of museums are always in flux, we conclude with developments in digital technologies. By the end of the semester, students will have gained both historical and ethnographic perspectives on how museums help us to know and reproduce ourselves and \"others,\" and how these institutions craft, control, and circulate cultural heritage.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 3 Topics in Museum Studies: Debates, Challenges and Collaborations in Art Museum Curating Elective. 4 points.   In this seminar we will examine the historical development of the role of the modern art museum curator, as well as practical and ethical challenges. Among the topics to be considered are: museum curating and canon formation, efforts to reactivate permanent collections through re-hanging, working with new or renovated buildings; collaborations with registrars, conservators and other colleagues; ethical aspects of working with artists; and issues related to museum fundraising and the art market. Inter-cultural issues such as the development of international branch museums; Latin American and Non-Western art collecting and exhibiting will be discussed. Current exhibitions in New York area will be used as some of the case studies, and museum visits are required for course assignments. There will be extensive historical and recent readings in the fields of museum studies, art history, history of exhibitions, texts by curators, museum directors, and critics. Although we will refer to exhibitions in the New York area in several lectures, you are encouraged to discuss museums outside the city and the US in your assignments. Note that in some of my class presentation case studies, I draw on my own professional experience and academic areas of specialization: Spanish and Latin American art. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 4 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Political Conflict Elective. 4 points. In contemporary Museum Studies, it is often said that museums are inherently political institutions. But how do politics actually happen in museums? What has \"politics\" meant for key exhibitions and collections and what avenues of political theory emerge from the museum in general? In this seminar, we will move beyond the general to examine how specific political concepts took shape in historic exhibitions and museum practices from the 1930s to the present. As such, our challenge will be twofold. On the one hand, we will consider how political movements have used the museums as an implement for advancing power and influence. On the other hand, we will consider how museum practices have \"taken up\" various kinds of politics: how museum objects and officials have engaged and advocated the agendas and outcomes of political parties, governments, policies, revolutions, and elections. Case studies will include: Degenerate Art (1937), Paris World Exhibition (1937), Rivera's \"Man at the Crossroads\" (1934), The Guggenheim Museum (1959), Yad Vashem (1965), Harlem on my Mind (1969), The Perfect Moment (1990), The Last Act (1994), The Jewish Museum of Bologna (1998), Sensation (1999), The Apartheid Museum (2001), Holocaust Cartoons (2006), among others. Through these case studies, students will examine the museum's role in the public sphere and the process whereby exhibitions contribute to-- or undermined--key aspects of deliberative democracy. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 5 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Community Elective. 4 points. There has been a turn towards community engagement in recent museum practice. Museum programming today includes civic activism, community participation, and even community organizing in its core activities. This trend manifests in all aspects of museum practice, including exhibition, education, research, and collections care. This seminar investigates the theoretical underpinnings of community engagement along with its practical outcomes. It builds an understanding of community programming in the context of critical museum theory. Collaborative student projects include a critique of existing museum programs and the design of a proposed community-based program at a museum.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 3332 Exhibition Planning and Design Elective. 4 points. This course focuses on the planning, development and design of exhibitions, permanent, temporary and traveling. It is a participatory class where students learn basic exhibition design techniques, including spatial layouts and the use of graphics, audio-visual aids, lighting, colors, materials, and fabrication methods. Students gain insight into exhibition planning and development and the roles played by various museum professionals. There are visits to designers to discuss their work and to museums and other venues to analyze exhibition design techniques. Individual student projects provide hands-on experience. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3335 Museums and Contemporary Art Elective. 4 points. This course investigates historical, theoretical, and practical aspects of the collecting and exhibiting of contemporary art in museums. Topics include curatorial strategies for exhibition and collection development, biennialism, the art market, conservation issues, artworks that take the museum as subject, public and relational art, and conflicts of interest that arise for museum staff and trustees. A familiarity with international contemporary art is required. Assignments include two short essays, class presentations, and a final paper. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3915 Research in Museum Studies Elective. 1-4 points. Independent research on a topic determined in consultation with the program director. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3990 Internship Required Course. 2 points. (Open to the Museum Studies students only) M.A. and Advanced Certificate students spend a minimum of 300 hours over one or more semesters in a project-oriented internship at a museum or other suitable institution.

The answer is YES!      A landscape is any outdoor space, planted or not. NYU has a great variety of urban landscapes that link academic and housing facilities here in Greenwich Village. NYU Landscaping is responsible for the design, installation, and maintenance of outdoor spaces enjoyed by NYU and the surrounding community.     Did you know you don\u2019t have to leave NYU\u2019s campus to see a Tulip tree, a Sweetgum, American hornbeam, or European Beech tree? You can even see, right here at NYU, a rare plant like Dutchman\u2019s Breeches, which was identified by the Weilikia Project as being present on Manhattan Island before European settlement back in 1609!                                   Dutchman's Breeches                                 American Hornbeam                                 Northern Sea Oats           Part of the vitality of today\u2019s cities has come from a new view of ecology\u2014urban ecology, which recognizes that cities are natural systems with the potential for making urban life more livable through new efforts to enhance nature in the urban realm. New York City, a world leader in this field since the construction of Central Park in the 19th Century, remains at the cutting edge of landscape design with sites like the Highline, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Gantry Plaza, Hudson River Park, and Battery Park City Parks.     Staying true to its founder\u2019s vision of a university \u201cin and of the city,\u201d NYU\u2014which has no walls and no gates\u2014remains inextricable from the fabric of New York City.     In accordance with the University's motto, &quot;a private university in the public service,&quot; NYU Landscaping serves both the University community and the historic neighborhood of Greenwich Village by designing, installing, and maintaining the urban landscapes that welcome people to the Washington Square campus. Our objective is to unify our eclectic campus with green spaces that combine the aims of urban restoration ecology with high aesthetic standards in design. We seek a deserving place for NYU within the time-honored horticultural tradition of Greenwich Village while keeping pace with the exciting new trends that make New York City a world model for high performance urban landscapes. NYU Landscaping aims to reflect the values of a global research university engaged in public service.                              NYU&#039;s Secret (and Not-So-Secret) Gardens                                                              NYU's graceful green spaces do more than beautify our campus\u2014they also provide countless passersby a brief respite from the grueling pace of city life. On this contemplative tour of the small plots tucked between NYU buildings, Supervisor of Landscaping George Reis explains how plants bring quiet dignity to an urban existence.                            NYU Sustainable Landscaping Projects                                                   Native Woodland Garden                                 238 Thompson Rooftop Garden                                 Mercer Plaza             Sustainable Landscaping Practices     The NYU Landscaping is committed to adding an ecological dimension to Washington Square campus garden areas. To achieve this, the NYU Landscaping has implementing the following sustainable gardening practices:       Adherence to NOFA Standards of Organic Landcare   Eliminating the use of neonicotinoids   Using native plants in formal garden designs   Composting garden waste   Employing native plants to support local pollinators            Introduction of Native Plant Species     Biodiversity promotes resilience to pest problems in the landscape.   Trees, shrubs, and perennials that evolved in our local area require fewer inputs over time than exotic species.   Choosing the right plants for the conditions of the site results in healthy plants that won't need chemical fertilizers or pesticides.   Native plants offer food and cover for local pollinators like bumble bees and endangered species like the Monarch butterfly.       LINKS:   New York Flora Atlas   National Wildlife Federation - Gardening for Wildlife          Eliminating chemical fertilizers     Petrochemical based, high nitrogen fertilizers can be damaging to the environment and cause rapid plant growth that attracts pests and disease.   A combination of good soil management, plant selection, using organic fertilizer and integrated pest management techniques will allow us to eliminate the use of all synthetic chemical fertilizers.     LINKS:   Organic Gardening   NOFA Organic Land Care Program   Stuyvesant Cove Park   Society for Organic Urban Land Care           Integrated Pest Management (IPM)     Biological, mechanical, and cultural controls that take into account a pest's life cycle and minimizes the need for pesticides. We can virtually eliminate chemical pesticide use by combining IPM with other sustainable gardening practices.     LINKS:    New York State Integrated Management Program    Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticides    Green Methods          Water Conservation     Low volume, micro irrigation reduces water usage by delivering moisture directly to an individual plant\u2019s root system. Flow rates are measured in gallons per hour and not gallons per minute as in conventional sprinkler systems. This results in significant savings in water consumption.            Reduction of lawn areas     Lawns should be used to promote healthy activities like exercise and relaxation, but overuse of lawn as a purely aesthetic landscape element has been shown to be expensive in a variety of ways. Current thinking in landscape sustainability aims to reduce unnecessary lawn area to diminish heavy inputs of water, fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, pesticides, and gas-powered mowing.   \u201cLow Mow\u201d or \u201cNo Mow\u201d native grass species like Carex pennsylvanica can replace conventional lawns, reducing environmental and maintenance costs.            Sustainable soil management with double digging, composting, and mulching     Microbial action in the soil is essential for healthy plant nutrient, oxygen, and water intake as well as disease suppression.   Soil management that maintains correct organic matter content feeds soil microbes and keeps plants healthy, thereby eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides.            Eliminating Gasoline Powered Maintenance Tools     Using hand tools such as rakes, hedge shears, and cultivators whenever feasible eliminates the air and noise pollution of gasoline-powered leaf blowers and other garden maintenance equipment.            Benefits of Sustainable Landscaping at NYU     NYU sustainable landscaping offers positive environmental and health benefits to the University community as well as the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood. Through the efficient use of local resources and sustainable gardening practices, the NYU Landscaping has contributed to the reduction of air, noise, and water pollution in the Washington Square area.          Ecology     Biodiversity in plant habitats fosters a more balanced, disease-resistant ecosystem.   Local fauna populations can rebound when supported by plant communities they share an evolutionary history with.   Gardens reduce noise, air pollution, and storm water runoff.   Organic fertilizers are made from renewable sources and are non-toxic.     LINKS:   Ecological Landscaping Association          Personal Health     Studies show that seeing a garden every day reduces stress.   Chemical-free gardens reduce people\u2019s exposure to toxins.            Education     Research opportunities for NYU\u2019s programs in Environmental Studies and Food Systems.   Sustainable gardening at NYU can become an example to home gardeners seeking methods to reduce their water use and eliminate the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.   Native plants evoke the natural history of our area.

Back to top    MSMS-GA 2222 Conservation and Collections Management Elective. 4 points. This seminar combines classroom discussion with museum visits to provide an understanding of preventive care, collections conservation, and collections management. It covers the historical and philosophical drive to preserve cultural objects for the future, and value conflicts that arise between professionals and non-professionals with stakes in how material culture is exhibited. The seminar addresses concerns of living artists as well as indigenous groups and others with claims to the disposition and care of cultural materials. It also covers collections management policies and procedures, including environmental management, disaster management, and collections documentation. Students perform condition assessments and conduct research leading to short writing assignments and a term paper.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 2223 Historic Sites, Cultural Landscapes and the Politics of Preservation Elective. 4 points. This course will examine the cultural politics that influence reuse of historic spaces for museums and other public purposes. Through course readings, site visits and individual archival research, students will explore sites ranging from historic houses and period rooms presented as museum installations to restored villages and communities to dramatic reuse of historic space for cultural tourism. Students will pay particular attention to the social and political contexts in which original use and subsequent reuse took place, and analyze primary documents that illustrate both motivations and strategies for interpretation. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 1 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and the Law Elective. 4 points. Legal issues pervade so many aspects of the world of museums. The law can both constrain and enable the behavior of museum staff, administration, and others who work with these cultural organizations. Therefore, it is difficult to work in, for and with museums without some training in or familiarity with the law. In this course, we will examine how museums are affected by a variety of legal regulations, including cultural heritage legislation, intellectual property issues, such as copyright, trademark and moral rights, first amendment and censorship claims, work-place hazards, contracts, and nonprofit and tax laws, such as valuation, charitable transfers, payments in lieu of taxes and the unrelated business income tax. Readings will consist of case law and secondary sources detailing the most pressing legal issues facing different types of museums, and group discussions will be supplemented by mock case studies and negotiation exercises. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 2 Topics in Museum Studies: Anthropology in and of Museums Elective. 4 points. This course considers \"the museum\" as an object of ethnographic inquiry, examining it as a social institution embedded in a broader field of cultural heritage that is perpetually under negotiation. We reflect on how museum principles of classification, practices of collection and exhibition, uptake of media, technology, and archiving have influenced the ways in which knowledge has been formed, presented, and represented; and interrogate the role of museums as significant social actors in broad anthropological debates on power, materiality, value, representation, culture, nationalism, circulation, aesthetics, science, history, and \"new\" technologies. The museum is never simply a repository of arts, cultures, histories, or scientific knowledges, but also a site of tremendous creativity and a field of complex social relations.    Relying on case studies as a springboard for discussion of broader theoretical interventions, this course is structured according to four overlapping themes. We think about museums as nodes in the traffic in art and culture, a metaphor for the transnational circulation of objects and competing regimes of value illuminating histories of colonialism, power relations, and intercultural production. Secondly, we interrogate the relationships between Indigenous people and museums, including national recognition of diversity, counter-narratives of history and belonging, performances of the other, and the intersections of Indigenous knowledge and various legal frameworks. Throughout the semester, we will think about the strategies and tools through which museums produce understandings of tangible artifacts (photographs, scientific specimens, artworks) and inspire reconsideration of preservation, archives, and memory. Finally, while the social lives of museums are always in flux, we conclude with developments in digital technologies. By the end of the semester, students will have gained both historical and ethnographic perspectives on how museums help us to know and reproduce ourselves and \"others,\" and how these institutions craft, control, and circulate cultural heritage.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 3 Topics in Museum Studies: Debates, Challenges and Collaborations in Art Museum Curating Elective. 4 points.   In this seminar we will examine the historical development of the role of the modern art museum curator, as well as practical and ethical challenges. Among the topics to be considered are: museum curating and canon formation, efforts to reactivate permanent collections through re-hanging, working with new or renovated buildings; collaborations with registrars, conservators and other colleagues; ethical aspects of working with artists; and issues related to museum fundraising and the art market. Inter-cultural issues such as the development of international branch museums; Latin American and Non-Western art collecting and exhibiting will be discussed. Current exhibitions in New York area will be used as some of the case studies, and museum visits are required for course assignments. There will be extensive historical and recent readings in the fields of museum studies, art history, history of exhibitions, texts by curators, museum directors, and critics. Although we will refer to exhibitions in the New York area in several lectures, you are encouraged to discuss museums outside the city and the US in your assignments. Note that in some of my class presentation case studies, I draw on my own professional experience and academic areas of specialization: Spanish and Latin American art. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 4 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Political Conflict Elective. 4 points. In contemporary Museum Studies, it is often said that museums are inherently political institutions. But how do politics actually happen in museums? What has \"politics\" meant for key exhibitions and collections and what avenues of political theory emerge from the museum in general? In this seminar, we will move beyond the general to examine how specific political concepts took shape in historic exhibitions and museum practices from the 1930s to the present. As such, our challenge will be twofold. On the one hand, we will consider how political movements have used the museums as an implement for advancing power and influence. On the other hand, we will consider how museum practices have \"taken up\" various kinds of politics: how museum objects and officials have engaged and advocated the agendas and outcomes of political parties, governments, policies, revolutions, and elections. Case studies will include: Degenerate Art (1937), Paris World Exhibition (1937), Rivera's \"Man at the Crossroads\" (1934), The Guggenheim Museum (1959), Yad Vashem (1965), Harlem on my Mind (1969), The Perfect Moment (1990), The Last Act (1994), The Jewish Museum of Bologna (1998), Sensation (1999), The Apartheid Museum (2001), Holocaust Cartoons (2006), among others. Through these case studies, students will examine the museum's role in the public sphere and the process whereby exhibitions contribute to-- or undermined--key aspects of deliberative democracy. Back to top    MSMS-GA 3330 Section: 5 Topics in Museum Studies: Museums and Community Elective. 4 points. There has been a turn towards community engagement in recent museum practice. Museum programming today includes civic activism, community participation, and even community organizing in its core activities. This trend manifests in all aspects of museum practice, including exhibition, education, research, and collections care. This seminar investigates the theoretical underpinnings of community engagement along with its practical outcomes. It builds an understanding of community programming in the context of critical museum theory. Collaborative student projects include a critique of existing museum programs and the design of a proposed community-based program at a museum.    Back to top    MSMS-GA 3332 Exhibition Planning and Design Elective. 4 points. This course focuses on the planning, development and design of exhibitions, permanent, temporary and traveling. It is a participatory class where students learn basic exhibition design techniques, including spatial layouts and the use of graphics, audio-visual aids, lighting, colors, materials, and fabrication methods. Students gain insight into exhibition planning and development and the roles played by various museum professionals. There are visits to designers to discuss their work and to museums and other venues to analyze exhibition design techniques. Individual student projects provide hands-on experience.

The answer is YES!      A landscape is any outdoor space, planted or not. NYU has a great variety of urban landscapes that link academic and housing facilities here in Greenwich Village. NYU Landscaping is responsible for the design, installation, and maintenance of outdoor spaces enjoyed by NYU and the surrounding community.     Did you know you don\u2019t have to leave NYU\u2019s campus to see a Tulip tree, a Sweetgum, American hornbeam, or European Beech tree? You can even see, right here at NYU, a rare plant like Dutchman\u2019s Breeches, which was identified by the Weilikia Project as being present on Manhattan Island before European settlement back in 1609!                                   Dutchman's Breeches                                 American Hornbeam                                 Northern Sea Oats           Part of the vitality of today\u2019s cities has come from a new view of ecology\u2014urban ecology, which recognizes that cities are natural systems with the potential for making urban life more livable through new efforts to enhance nature in the urban realm. New York City, a world leader in this field since the construction of Central Park in the 19th Century, remains at the cutting edge of landscape design with sites like the Highline, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Gantry Plaza, Hudson River Park, and Battery Park City Parks.     Staying true to its founder\u2019s vision of a university \u201cin and of the city,\u201d NYU\u2014which has no walls and no gates\u2014remains inextricable from the fabric of New York City.     In accordance with the University's motto, &quot;a private university in the public service,&quot; NYU Landscaping serves both the University community and the historic neighborhood of Greenwich Village by designing, installing, and maintaining the urban landscapes that welcome people to the Washington Square campus. Our objective is to unify our eclectic campus with green spaces that combine the aims of urban restoration ecology with high aesthetic standards in design. We seek a deserving place for NYU within the time-honored horticultural tradition of Greenwich Village while keeping pace with the exciting new trends that make New York City a world model for high performance urban landscapes. NYU Landscaping aims to reflect the values of a global research university engaged in public service.                              NYU&#039;s Secret (and Not-So-Secret) Gardens                                                              NYU's graceful green spaces do more than beautify our campus\u2014they also provide countless passersby a brief respite from the grueling pace of city life. On this contemplative tour of the small plots tucked between NYU buildings, Supervisor of Landscaping George Reis explains how plants bring quiet dignity to an urban existence.                            NYU Sustainable Landscaping Projects                                                   Native Woodland Garden                                 238 Thompson Rooftop Garden                                 Mercer Plaza             Sustainable Landscaping Practices     The NYU Landscaping is committed to adding an ecological dimension to Washington Square campus garden areas. To achieve this, the NYU Landscaping has implementing the following sustainable gardening practices:       Adherence to NOFA Standards of Organic Landcare   Eliminating the use of neonicotinoids   Using native plants in formal garden designs   Composting garden waste   Employing native plants to support local pollinators            Introduction of Native Plant Species     Biodiversity promotes resilience to pest problems in the landscape.   Trees, shrubs, and perennials that evolved in our local area require fewer inputs over time than exotic species.   Choosing the right plants for the conditions of the site results in healthy plants that won't need chemical fertilizers or pesticides.   Native plants offer food and cover for local pollinators like bumble bees and endangered species like the Monarch butterfly.       LINKS:   New York Flora Atlas   National Wildlife Federation - Gardening for Wildlife          Eliminating chemical fertilizers     Petrochemical based, high nitrogen fertilizers can be damaging to the environment and cause rapid plant growth that attracts pests and disease.   A combination of good soil management, plant selection, using organic fertilizer and integrated pest management techniques will allow us to eliminate the use of all synthetic chemical fertilizers.     LINKS:   Organic Gardening   NOFA Organic Land Care Program   Stuyvesant Cove Park   Society for Organic Urban Land Care           Integrated Pest Management (IPM)     Biological, mechanical, and cultural controls that take into account a pest's life cycle and minimizes the need for pesticides. We can virtually eliminate chemical pesticide use by combining IPM with other sustainable gardening practices.     LINKS:    New York State Integrated Management Program    Northwest Center for Alternatives to Pesticides    Green Methods          Water Conservation     Low volume, micro irrigation reduces water usage by delivering moisture directly to an individual plant\u2019s root system. Flow rates are measured in gallons per hour and not gallons per minute as in conventional sprinkler systems. This results in significant savings in water consumption.            Reduction of lawn areas     Lawns should be used to promote healthy activities like exercise and relaxation, but overuse of lawn as a purely aesthetic landscape element has been shown to be expensive in a variety of ways. Current thinking in landscape sustainability aims to reduce unnecessary lawn area to diminish heavy inputs of water, fertilizer, herbicides, fungicides, pesticides, and gas-powered mowing.   \u201cLow Mow\u201d or \u201cNo Mow\u201d native grass species like Carex pennsylvanica can replace conventional lawns, reducing environmental and maintenance costs.            Sustainable soil management with double digging, composting, and mulching     Microbial action in the soil is essential for healthy plant nutrient, oxygen, and water intake as well as disease suppression.   Soil management that maintains correct organic matter content feeds soil microbes and keeps plants healthy, thereby eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides.            Eliminating Gasoline Powered Maintenance Tools     Using hand tools such as rakes, hedge shears, and cultivators whenever feasible eliminates the air and noise pollution of gasoline-powered leaf blowers and other garden maintenance equipment.            Benefits of Sustainable Landscaping at NYU     NYU sustainable landscaping offers positive environmental and health benefits to the University community as well as the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood. Through the efficient use of local resources and sustainable gardening practices, the NYU Landscaping has contributed to the reduction of air, noise, and water pollution in the Washington Square area.          Ecology     Biodiversity in plant habitats fosters a more balanced, disease-resistant ecosystem.   Local fauna populations can rebound when supported by plant communities they share an evolutionary history with.   Gardens reduce noise, air pollution, and storm water runoff.   Organic fertilizers are made from renewable sources and are non-toxic.     LINKS:   Ecological Landscaping Association          Personal Health     Studies show that seeing a garden every day reduces stress.   Chemical-free gardens reduce people\u2019s exposure to toxins.            Education     Research opportunities for NYU\u2019s programs in Environmental Studies and Food Systems.   Sustainable gardening at NYU can become an example to home gardeners seeking methods to reduce their water use and eliminate the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.   Native plants evoke the natural history of our area.

This garden was the Legacy Gift of the Class of 2008 and coincided with the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Henry Hudson in New York Harbor. The plant list was provided by the Mannahatta Project, now renamed the Weilikia Project .                                   Coles Sport Center Garden   Every year since 2007, Coles has been the site of a dazzling display of several thousand tulips which flower in conjunction the Kwanzan cherry trees on Bleecker Street. This area is also home to a collection of Japanese camellias and a native meadow planting which replaced lawn in 2007.                                   238 Thompson Rooftop Garden   This 3,700 square foot un-irrigated green roof features a wide variety of plants not typically seen on green roofs: Wild Columbine, Goldenrod, Moss Phlox, Corsican Violet, and even chives are just a few of the plants that grace this roof bordering Washington Square Park.                                   Bleecker Street Plantbeds   Since 2007, NYU Landscaping has planted 13,000 square feet of mixed garden beds on Bleecker Street featuring more than 50 species of trees, shrubs, perennials, grasses, and bulbs. Many of these plants were organically grown in the gardens of Battery Park and transplanted at Bleecker Street.                                   Mercer Plaza (Cogen Park)   This 13,000 square foot plaza was built in 2010 atop NYU\u2019s state of the art Cogeneration Plant. Plantings include a collection of native trees like Tulip trees, Sweetgum, and Willow Oaks, along with a variety of native shrubs, perennials, and grasses such as Witch Hazel, Rose Mallow, and Switchgrass.                                   Willy's Memorial Garden at One-Half Fifth Avenue   This 8,000 square foot courtyard garden serves as the entrance to the Graduate School of Arts and Science and the faculty residences of 7-13 Washington Square North. This garden is currently undergoing a renovation to introduce new shrubs, perennials, and bulbs for year round interest.                                 Tree Guards for NYC Street Trees   To protect street trees that face NYU buildings and beautify the sidewalks, NYU has begun a project to install iron tree guards in treepits around campus.

For example, instead of using imidichloprid, one of the class of pesticides implicated in bee colony collapse, on a scale infestation of a shingle oak tree, we took some extra time and effort to simply powerwash the insects off the tree with water.                                   NYU LANDSCAPING QUICK FACTS     NYU is home to:       3 memorial gardens, including a formal garden on Fifth Avenue   over 700 trees of over 60 species   over 200 plant containers on sidewalks, terraces, and in courtyards   over 180 species of shrubs, perennials, and bulbs   a 12,000 sq. ft. courtyard that features a trompe l\u2019oeil, an optical illusion painted onto the surface of a building   a 3-story vertical garden   a native landscape that was featured in the garden column of the New York Times   a 9/11 memorial tree of the same species found in the National 9/11 Memorial Park at Ground Zero   all 4 of our region\u2019s primary spring-flowering trees here at NYU: dogwood, magnolia, apple, and cherry   a grove of native oak trees   a green roof that features lots of native plants   a garden statue donated by the people of Spain   a formal Japanese garden   over 70 distinct outdoor green spaces   ten acres of open space in the middle of Manhattan            Other Landscaping Projects   The NYU Urban Forest Project   In response to superstorm Sandy, NYU commissioned a campus wide tree inventory and risk assessment of over 700 trees on and adjacent to NYU properties. We now have a wealth of data which will be used to manage the NYU\u2019s Urban Forest.        9/11 Memorial Tree   This tree, provided by NYU\u2019s Center for Student Activites, Leadership, &amp; Service, was planted in the Silver Towers Oak Grove on September 7, 2011 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the events of 9/11. The tree species, Quercus bicolor (Swamp White Oak), is the same species employed in the park of the National 9/11 Memorial at Ground Zero.        Oak Sedge Trials at NYU   Sedges are grass-like plants that are native to our region, and also native to Manhattan island. One species in particular, Oak Sedge, has caught the attention of designers as a possible lawn substitute for certain types of areas. We\u2019re currently evaluating Oak Sedge at various NYU sites and the results so far are promising.          Silver Towers Oak Grove   The Oak Grove is a half-acre site on the north side of the Silver Towers complex. It features 22 native species of oak trees including Willow oak, Red oak, and Swamp White oak This site is unique in Greenwich Village for the large number of mature, native trees.
