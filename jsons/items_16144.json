NYU Biology's growth in Evolutionary Biology has been built largely at the interfaces of disciplines already strong in the department: developmental genetics, genomics and systems biology, and molecular evolution/systematics. As such, areas of focus include: Molecular and Genomic Evolution, Evolutionary Systems Biology, Experimental Evolution, Evolution of Developmental Systems and Molecular Systematics/Phylogenetics. Research opportunities span different levels of organization, such as: molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of genomes, gene-interaction networks, developmental and genetic processes, morphology and adaptive features; phylogenetic relationships and character evolution; the genetic/genomic architectures of populations; and the history of life on earth. Model organisms used in these studies include bacteria, single-celled eukaryotes, plants, nematode worms, flies and parasitic wasps, plants, cave fish, and primates. Theory and computational biology are regularly integrated with the experimental work to build explanatory models. Major facilities and resources at NYU Biology supporting these studies include: the Sequencing (GenCore) Facility (high-throughput sequencing and expression analysis), the Computational Core , an Imaging Core (with confocal and other microscopes), and special collections (e.g. the NYU Rhabditid Collection with live strains of &gt;150 nematode species). Our research and education missions in evolutionary biology are assisted by associations with other NYU departments ( Anthropology , Computer Science ), the American Museum of Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and the Wildlife Conservation Society .  Ecology and Environmental Biology at NYU covers interactions among organisms, environments, and Earth. For research, Ecology and Environmental Biology draws on the diverse interests of our faculty across a range of levels from microbes and invertebrates to mammals and ecosystems, and includes geosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. Current areas of focus include: Climate Change, Biogeochemistry, Mass Extinctions, Disease Ecology, Biodiversity, and Landscape Ecology. Most faculty have joint or associated appointments with the Environmental Studies Program .

Recent research suggests that complementing schooling through programs that occur in informal learning spaces (e.g. libraries, museums, or out-of-school programs) is instrumental for cultivating youth&rsquo;s specialized interests, educational dispositions and civic identities. Implementing organizations in this study work with cultural institutions to provide innovative after-school and summer programs, and operate two schools (one each in NYC and Chicago), that use game design and digital learning to enhance young people&rsquo;s interests, community awareness, and shape their educational outcomes.    The purpose of this research is to document activities and outcomes associated with these programs, specifically, how these programs are actually implemented and whether participation changes the behaviors and attitudes youth exhibit around schooling and digital media use. This study also seeks to identify how educators understand and implement their educational visions. The research project seeks to address the following questions:       What are the characteristics of youth participating in the study school/program (e.g., demographics, socioeconomic status, academic performance)?    How do participants&rsquo; interaction with and access to digital media and communication technologies influence their everyday lives?    How do participants&rsquo; attitudes, behaviors, and competencies in the area of digital technology and learning change?    How do changes in attitudes in behaviors and attitudes toward digital technology and learning vary based on program or school characteristics (e.g. size, cost, pedagogical style, and type of activity offered) and based on student characteristics?    How the programs are understood and implemented in schools and partnering cultural organizations.       The Project is headed by Richard Arum . Three NYU doctoral students (Max Meyer, Alexis Pang and Jason Thompson) and research assistant (Jane Park, M.A.) comprise the New York research team; two doctoral students from the University of Chicago (Alex Moffet-Batteau and Rafael Santana) and one post-doctoral researcher (Kiley Larson) comprise the Chicago team.
