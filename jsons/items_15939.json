Current News/Projects  Updated June 2014     Pintupi dialogues: reconstructing memories of art, land and Community   through the visual record (Australian Research Council Linkage grant   2010-2013) .\u2028   I am currently completing work on an ARC Linkage grant to use visual   records to animate historical consciousness with the Pintupi   communities of Kintore, NT and Kiwirrkura, WA. This involves not only   returning to my earliest work in Pintupi communities, but also extending   my involvement with visual culture, representations, and art. The   grant is a collaboration with the mainly Pintupi Aboriginal-owned art   cooperative, Papunya Tula Artists Ltd., Dr. Peter Thorley of the   National Museum of Australia, and Professor Nicolas Peterson and Ms.   Philippa Deveson of the Australian National University, Dr Peter Thorley   of the National Museum of Australia, and myself of New York University.   Together with the members of these two remote Western Desert   communities, we are using film and photography to reflect on a pivotal   period in the history of the Pintupi people with whom I have been   working since 1973. In 1964, internationally renowned filmmaker, Ian   Dunlop accompanying then Patrol Officer Jeremy Long, had photographed Pintupi people as among the   last Aboriginal people still living a nomadic life in central   Australia's western desert. He returned in 1974 to film these same   people, now living at the government-supported Yayayi outstation where I   was carrying out my doctoral fieldwork.      (Fred Myers and Marlene Nampitjinpa Spencer discussing her memories of Yayayi) Using these visual records as the basis for a dialogue with the living   Pintupi descendants of those in the film and photographs, we are   reconstructing an account of how the Pintupi sought to fashion their own   modernity, with a particular emphasis on the great transition \u2013   sedentarization and incorporation into the Australian state -- in their   lives that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.     We have produced a film that attends to this dialogue, focusing on   Marlene Spencer Nampitjinpa's reflections on the film, entitled   \"Remembering Yayayi,\" Her reflections about herself and her family as   they appear in the footage incorporate points of view from several other   Pintupi consultants about the earlier film footage and the outstation.     As another distinct part of this, I am writing a book on the early   period of Pintupi living in this remote outstation community,   significant as one of the first outstation or homeland communities   established within the then-new policy framework of \u201cAboriginal   self-determination\u201d articulated by the Whitlam government upon its   election in 1973. The policies of \u201cself-determination\u201d \u2013 an expression   of international as well as local aspirations for colonized people --   have in recent years been heavily criticized by conservatives in   Australia as a failure and a significant cause of the many problems that   continue to plague Indigenous Australia. My goal in writing this book   is to confront these representations with an historically nuanced   account of life and the imaginings of a future in such a community.     Australian Cultural Fields: National and Transnational Dynamics  Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP140101970) \u2013 2014-2016     I am part of a new group project, funded by the Australian Research   Council and directed by Professor Tony Bennett of the University of   Western Sydney, that is just commencing. \"Australian Cultural Fields\"   examines the forces changing contemporary Australian culture. Focusing   on art, literature, media, sport, music and heritage, it assesses the   influence of transnationalism, digital media, migration and   multiculturalism, and the distinctive presence of Indigenous culture, on   the relations between culture, class, gender, ethnicity and nation.    The concept of \u2018cultural field\u2019 is taken from the work of sociologist   Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea to investigate how the   production and consumption of culture are affected by relations between   cultural institutions, policy agencies, and cultural markets. Australian   Cultural Fields will develop this perspective in number of ways. It   will be the first study to examine transnational forces, new information   technologies and the changing salience of migrant and Indigenous   cultures in the contemporary Australian context. Internationally, it   will be the first large-scale study to interrogate the relations between   the fields of cultural production and consumption.     It is going to be a challenge for me to work with new methodologies and   kinds of information, but very exciting. I will be working with some of   the leading scholars in Australian Cultural Studies -- Tony Bennett,   Graeme Turner, Greg Noble, David Rowe, David Carter, Deborah Stevenson,   Emma Waterton, and my old friend Tim Rowse.

It will focus especially on memoirs, whether in written or audiovisual form, which confront exclusionary and essentialist discourses with a rich cultural production that foregrounds a complex understanding of such issues as \u201chome,\u201d \u201chomeland,\u201d \u201cexile,\u201d \u201chybridity\u201d and \u201cminorities.\u201d How are identity and history performed in these colonial, post-colonial and diasporic contexts?

We will also address questions of genre, and the socio-political ramifications of certain modes of writing and performances of memory that create new hybrid genres such as the poetic documentary and experimental autobiography.

Current News/Projects  Updated June 2014     Pintupi dialogues: reconstructing memories of art, land and Community   through the visual record (Australian Research Council Linkage grant   2010-2013) .\u2028   I am currently completing work on an ARC Linkage grant to use visual   records to animate historical consciousness with the Pintupi   communities of Kintore, NT and Kiwirrkura, WA. This involves not only   returning to my earliest work in Pintupi communities, but also extending   my involvement with visual culture, representations, and art. The   grant is a collaboration with the mainly Pintupi Aboriginal-owned art   cooperative, Papunya Tula Artists Ltd., Dr. Peter Thorley of the   National Museum of Australia, and Professor Nicolas Peterson and Ms.   Philippa Deveson of the Australian National University, Dr Peter Thorley   of the National Museum of Australia, and myself of New York University.   Together with the members of these two remote Western Desert   communities, we are using film and photography to reflect on a pivotal   period in the history of the Pintupi people with whom I have been   working since 1973. In 1964, internationally renowned filmmaker, Ian   Dunlop accompanying then Patrol Officer Jeremy Long, had photographed Pintupi people as among the   last Aboriginal people still living a nomadic life in central   Australia's western desert. He returned in 1974 to film these same   people, now living at the government-supported Yayayi outstation where I   was carrying out my doctoral fieldwork.      (Fred Myers and Marlene Nampitjinpa Spencer discussing her memories of Yayayi) Using these visual records as the basis for a dialogue with the living   Pintupi descendants of those in the film and photographs, we are   reconstructing an account of how the Pintupi sought to fashion their own   modernity, with a particular emphasis on the great transition \u2013   sedentarization and incorporation into the Australian state -- in their   lives that took place in the 1960s and 1970s.     We have produced a film that attends to this dialogue, focusing on   Marlene Spencer Nampitjinpa's reflections on the film, entitled   \"Remembering Yayayi,\" Her reflections about herself and her family as   they appear in the footage incorporate points of view from several other   Pintupi consultants about the earlier film footage and the outstation.     As another distinct part of this, I am writing a book on the early   period of Pintupi living in this remote outstation community,   significant as one of the first outstation or homeland communities   established within the then-new policy framework of \u201cAboriginal   self-determination\u201d articulated by the Whitlam government upon its   election in 1973. The policies of \u201cself-determination\u201d \u2013 an expression   of international as well as local aspirations for colonized people --   have in recent years been heavily criticized by conservatives in   Australia as a failure and a significant cause of the many problems that   continue to plague Indigenous Australia. My goal in writing this book   is to confront these representations with an historically nuanced   account of life and the imaginings of a future in such a community.     Australian Cultural Fields: National and Transnational Dynamics  Australian Research Council Discovery Project (DP140101970) \u2013 2014-2016     I am part of a new group project, funded by the Australian Research   Council and directed by Professor Tony Bennett of the University of   Western Sydney, that is just commencing. \"Australian Cultural Fields\"   examines the forces changing contemporary Australian culture. Focusing   on art, literature, media, sport, music and heritage, it assesses the   influence of transnationalism, digital media, migration and   multiculturalism, and the distinctive presence of Indigenous culture, on   the relations between culture, class, gender, ethnicity and nation.    The concept of \u2018cultural field\u2019 is taken from the work of sociologist   Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea to investigate how the   production and consumption of culture are affected by relations between   cultural institutions, policy agencies, and cultural markets. Australian   Cultural Fields will develop this perspective in number of ways. It   will be the first study to examine transnational forces, new information   technologies and the changing salience of migrant and Indigenous   cultures in the contemporary Australian context. Internationally, it   will be the first large-scale study to interrogate the relations between   the fields of cultural production and consumption.     It is going to be a challenge for me to work with new methodologies and   kinds of information, but very exciting. I will be working with some of   the leading scholars in Australian Cultural Studies -- Tony Bennett,   Graeme Turner, Greg Noble, David Rowe, David Carter, Deborah Stevenson,   Emma Waterton, and my old friend Tim Rowse.
