For college program applicants, click here for Arthur O. Eve HEOP and CSTEP admission information and Financial Aid deadlines.         New York State Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP)       Sponsored by the New York State Department of Education, the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) at NYU is designed to assist students who are residents of New York State who are academically and educationally disadvantaged. In addition to financial assistance, students in the program receive supportive services including counseling and tutoring to help ensure their success. Students must meet academic and family income guidelines to be eligible, and must attend a six-week summer program prior to the start of their freshman year. No special application is required for HEOP consideration, and New York State residents are automatically reviewed for eligibility during our normal application review process.    Read More HEOP Information         Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP)   CSTEP is a NYU program for New York State residents underrepresented in business, law, science, and health-related programs who do not qualify for the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP). CSTEP students receive the same academic and counseling services that HEOP students receive, and participate in the same six-week summer program before their freshman year. No special application is required for CSTEP consideration, and New York State residents are automatically reviewed for eligibility during our normal application review process.   Read More CSTEP Information           Middle School and High School Program    The Science and Technology Program (STEP) and the Building Excellence in Science and Technology (BEST)* program at New York University (NYU) is an innovative pre-college enrichment program for talented and motivated middle and high school students in New York City. Our goal is to (1) prepare our students to be competitive so that they are accepted into a selective college of their choice and (2) encourage and increase the number of historically under-represented minority groups in the science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) careers, health-related fields and licensed professions.    *BEST is a joint program with STEP, which is specifically designed to serve students attending middle school and high school in Brooklyn schools located in District 13.

There are a variety of social programs, groups and clubs looking for students eager to develop leadership skills by taking primary roles in their organizations.   Peer leaders call on their experience and training to provide guidance to fellow students and members of the community. Members of the student government cultivate the kinds decision making and cooperation skills required to be sought after future leaders. Student leaders organize community outreach projects, plan fundraisers and events, recruit team members and supervise a wide range of programs. Whether it's assuming a primary role in a club or heading a service initiative, there are many opportunities at NYU for students who want to become leaders.

The following programs are some of the ways students can hone skills and personally develop their abilities to navigate in a variety of settings - be they foreign countries, professional settings, or research environments. Opportunities such as these offer students at NYU the chance to distinguish themselves among their peers as they step off NYU's campus and into the world. Students find these unique academic opportunities to be some of the most fun, rewarding, and life-altering experiences they have during their time at NYU.

For college program applicants, click here for Arthur O. Eve HEOP and CSTEP admission information and Financial Aid deadlines.         New York State Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP)       Sponsored by the New York State Department of Education, the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) at NYU is designed to assist students who are residents of New York State who are academically and educationally disadvantaged. In addition to financial assistance, students in the program receive supportive services including counseling and tutoring to help ensure their success. Students must meet academic and family income guidelines to be eligible, and must attend a six-week summer program prior to the start of their freshman year. No special application is required for HEOP consideration, and New York State residents are automatically reviewed for eligibility during our normal application review process.    Read More HEOP Information         Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP)   CSTEP is a NYU program for New York State residents underrepresented in business, law, science, and health-related programs who do not qualify for the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP). CSTEP students receive the same academic and counseling services that HEOP students receive, and participate in the same six-week summer program before their freshman year. No special application is required for CSTEP consideration, and New York State residents are automatically reviewed for eligibility during our normal application review process.   Read More CSTEP Information           Middle School and High School Program    The Science and Technology Program (STEP) and the Building Excellence in Science and Technology (BEST)* program at New York University (NYU) is an innovative pre-college enrichment program for talented and motivated middle and high school students in New York City. Our goal is to (1) prepare our students to be competitive so that they are accepted into a selective college of their choice and (2) encourage and increase the number of historically under-represented minority groups in the science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) careers, health-related fields and licensed professions.    *BEST is a joint program with STEP, which is specifically designed to serve students attending middle school and high school in Brooklyn schools located in District 13.

There are a variety of social programs, groups and clubs looking for students eager to develop leadership skills by taking primary roles in their organizations.   Peer leaders call on their experience and training to provide guidance to fellow students and members of the community. Members of the student government cultivate the kinds decision making and cooperation skills required to be sought after future leaders. Student leaders organize community outreach projects, plan fundraisers and events, recruit team members and supervise a wide range of programs. Whether it's assuming a primary role in a club or heading a service initiative, there are many opportunities at NYU for students who want to become leaders.
