Scripts, images, artifacts, diaries, videos of live performance, newpaper reviews, playbills, motion pictures and more all can be considered primary sources for the performing arts.     Think of a primary source as:       &quot;firsthand evidence&quot;; it is FROM the time, not ABOUT the time.    written by the participants or observers.    also an artifact of the time, or an actual image from the time itself.      Primary sources can be both published and unpublished. Published documents - books, newspapers, pamphlets, advertisements, government reports, laws, etc. Scholarly journal articles that report results of original research are also considered primary sources. As are unpublished documents - letters, diaries, financial records, etc. Oral and visual artifacts - objects produced by human craft, such as speeches, recordings, paintings, photographs, films, archaeological finds, etc. - are also consider primary.

Scripts, images, artifacts, diaries, videos of live performance, newpaper reviews, playbills, motion pictures and more all can be considered primary sources for the performing arts.     Think of a primary source as:       &quot;firsthand evidence&quot;; it is FROM the time, not ABOUT the time.    written by the participants or observers.    also an artifact of the time, or an actual image from the time itself.      Primary sources can be both published and unpublished. Published documents - books, newspapers, pamphlets, advertisements, government reports, laws, etc. Scholarly journal articles that report results of original research are also considered primary sources. As are unpublished documents - letters, diaries, financial records, etc. Oral and visual artifacts - objects produced by human craft, such as speeches, recordings, paintings, photographs, films, archaeological finds, etc. - are also consider primary. Here are just a few examples of materials that constitute primary sources...
