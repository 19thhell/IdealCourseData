List of Publications from Pubmed         Research:      Our laboratory is interested in the integrative analysis of diverse functional genomics data to identify groups of  genes that work in specific cellular and developmental processes. A major challenge in systems biology is how  to extract meaningful biological insights from large heterogeneous data sets that probe different aspects of gene  function. Several ongoing projects in the lab use integrative approaches to analyze and interpret large-scale  datasets and to generate testable hypotheses on gene function in different biological systems. These projects  all involve close collaborative interaction between experimental and computational scientists.         Molecular networks in C. elegans early embryogenesis   We have used an integrative approach to characterize gene networks that function in the very early C. elegans   embryo, based on data from different kinds of functional genomics data that we and others have collected, such as  protein-protein interactions, gene expression profiles, and phenotypic maps (Fig. 1). We are currently extending this  work in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Fabio Piano to systematically define genetic interactions in C. elegans   early embryogenesis. Genetic interactions tell us about logical relationships between different cellular components, and we  are analyzing how these functional dependencies complement other functional data that we already have in hand. The  long-term goal of this work is to develop a global map of the molecular architecture underlying early development in C. elegans .         Figure 1. C. elegans gene networks in early embryogenesis. (a) A composite view of around 30,000 functional linkages between 661 C. elegans   genes with phenotypes in the early embryo, based on protein-protein  interactions (Int), phenotypic similarity based on a signature of 45  early embryonic phenotypic characters (Ph), and gene co-expression in a  compendium of gene expression data (Tr). (b) When the network is  filtered for high-confidence functional links between genes (supported  by two or more types of functional genomic data, e.g. phenotypic  correlation and protein-protein interaction), a modular organization of  molecular machinery is revealed, in which groups of highly  interconnected genes are linked to each other via a small number of  functional interactions. Adapted from Gunsalus et al., Nature 2005 .         Genetic requirements for mouse early embryogenesis   We are collaborating with Dr. Nicole Noyes of the NYU School of Medicine to predict and  analyze RNAi phenotypes in early mouse embryos using time-lapse microscopy. For this  work, we are leveraging functional genomic data from several model organisms to identify  candidate genes for RNAi that will help us define the spectrum of phenotypic defects that  can occur in early mammalian embryos, similar to our previous work in C. elegans . One  of the goals of this translational project is to develop a more sophisticated and non-invasive way  to determine the developmental potential of human embryos for patients who seek reproductive  assistance for infertility.         Post-transcriptional gene regulation in C. elegans   Regulation of mRNA localization, translation, and stability is increasingly recognized as in important layer  in the regulation of gene activity in diverse biological systems. The modENCODE Consortium is an NIH/NHGRI  initiative to identify and analyze functional elements in model organism genomes. As part of modENCODE, we  are involved in the annotation of C. elegans 3\u2019UTRs and functional sequence elements contained in  these regions. The goal of this work is to identify and test putative post-transcriptional regulatory networks in  development. This project is a collaboration with Fabio Piano (PI), John Kim (U. Michigan, Co-PI), and Nikolaus  Rajewsky (Center for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbruck Center, Berlin, Co-PI).         Interactive tools for functional genomic data   As part of these projects, we develop web-based tools and graphical interfaces to provide the research  community at large with enhanced access to and mining capabilities for large-scale functional genomic data.  To facilitate a systems-level view of gene networks, we have developed a web-based network visualization  tool called \"N-Browse\" ( http://www.gnetbrowse.org ) that allows  researchers to browse gene neighborhoods and heterogeneous functional relationships in a modular way based  on these integrated data. We have also developed a web-accessible database of RNA interference (RNAi)  phenotypes in C. elegans , \"RNAiDB\" ( http://www.rnai.org ),  which we use both to distribute data from large-scale RNAi studies and as an online notebook for ongoing  high-content phenotypic analysis. In conjunction, we are developing strategies to make phenotypic data  more amenable to computational analysis and tools to mine these data.      Web Resources:            Employment Opportunities:   The Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU Abu Dhabi is currently inviting applications for multiple Bioinformatics Software Engineer positions.
