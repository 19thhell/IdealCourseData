Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict?

Topics include: descriptive statistics; introduction to probability; sampling; statistical inference concerning means, standard deviations, and proportions; correlation; analysis of variance; linear regression, including multiple regression analysis. Applications to empirical situations are an integral part of the course. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.

Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      Voices from the Margin: Modern Chinese and Sinophone Writers - GCHN-SHU 263 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the modern and contemporary Chinese-speaking world is diverse, vast, and challenging for the migrant and exilic minds whose creative energies are often driven by their poignant insights to the turbulent events around them. Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.                              Interactive Media and Technology                                                    Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.

It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.

Topics include: descriptive statistics; introduction to probability; sampling; statistical inference concerning means, standard deviations, and proportions; correlation; analysis of variance; linear regression, including multiple regression analysis. Applications to empirical situations are an integral part of the course. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.

Prerequisite: Microeconomics or equivalent.   This course examines the forces driving toward globalization: the integration of national business activities into globally competitive markets. International trade is a key driver of global integration. The role of comparative advantage as a determinant of the location of production is examined. Also examined are the reasons for and effects of government policies that create impediments to international trade. The second part of the course surveys the role of money and finance in global economic activity. The role of exchange rates as key variables in global finance is introduced. Also examined is the role of government policies toward the foreign exchange market, including the choice between fixed and floating exchange rates and the use of exchange controls to create impediments to currency exchanges. The course also introduces the concept of foreign direct investment and discusses the rising importance of multinational corporations.                                Experimental Discovery in the Natural World                                                  Where the City Meets the Sea - CCEX-SHU 116 - 4 points                               Over half of the human population lives within 100 km of a coast and coastlines contain more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s largest cities. As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.                                Global China Studies                                                  Social and Cultural Debates in 20th Century China - GCHN-SHU 231 - 4 points                               \u201cOur present trouble lies in our clinging to old institutions without knowing how to change,\u201d Kang Youwei wrote in a letter to the Emperor in 1898. Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      Voices from the Margin: Modern Chinese and Sinophone Writers - GCHN-SHU 263 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the modern and contemporary Chinese-speaking world is diverse, vast, and challenging for the migrant and exilic minds whose creative energies are often driven by their poignant insights to the turbulent events around them. Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.

Virtually all your college courses require you to write papers or reports, but courses offered by the Expository Writing Program are opportunities to concentrate intensely on the process of writing. The Expository Writing Program assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester\u2019s work progresses. Additional information, requirements and course descriptions appear on the Expository Writing Program website.     Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as government, business, and research. NYU is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its rapidly expanding opportunities for study abroad. To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence (see list of courses below). Some languages are also taught in intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages are encouraged to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Students of all languages, ancient or modern, are encouraged to continue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions: Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test in a foreign language, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, and for Advanced Placement Test equivalencies, consult your advisor or the College of Arts and Science Bulletin (available online from the CAS website). Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, International Writing Workshop I; and EXPOS-UA 9, International Writing Workshop II), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the B.S./B.E. program. In addition to the foreign languages courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909.\u2028    Foreign Language Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available. Completion of any of the following courses will fulfill the foreign language requirement. Please consult the individual departmental listings for information on prerequisite courses.

For more information on specific language classes, placement, or exemption, please contact the language coordinator, director of language programs, or director of undergraduate studies named in the individual departmental listings. Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Catalan, Czech (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), Dutch, Finnish, Georgian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Kannada, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908 or click here for more information.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture is the arts, humanities, and social sciences component of the College Core Curriculum. Within each of its components, students are free to pursue their interests through their choice of classes. The structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information below, to learn more about FCC courses, we strongly recommend that you browse past and present syllabuses. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas is the name for a diverse group of humanities courses that study challenging, influential texts about big ideas: freedom, the nature of the soul, the place of humans in the natural and animal world, beauty, citizenship, morality, the imagination, the use of the past, and many more. Some courses explore a single theme or a set of closely related ideas; others investigate the relationship between two periods of intellectual history, for example, selected writings in the philosophy and literature of ancient Greece and Rome and their reception in a later era. Texts and Ideas courses also seek to refine students\u2019 ability to write and speak about complex concepts and arguments with clarity, originality, and eloquence. You will be challenged not only to master the content of some of the world\u2019s most influential philosophical texts and works of literature, but to discuss how the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected over time. Cultures and Contexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways humans see themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional groups. Individual courses focus on political, social, or cultural collectives that are distinct from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America, such as central Asia, Russia, Korea, or ancient Egypt; some courses study diaspora formations and emergent traditions. Primary texts are central to every course, with some faculty concentrating on historical documents, others on art, film, or literary texts. Cultures and Contexts courses share a common aim to examine the ways cultures emerge and interact through trade, colonization, immigration, religious proselytization, and representation in various media; how groups define themselves through beliefs, values, and customs; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which premodern or non-Western peoples experience and imagine their lives.  Societies and the Social Sciences We live in a world molded by massive social, political, and economic transformations, and to be thoughtful, responsible citizens we need to understand them. From the nineteenth century to today, drawing on earlier movements, thinkers have developed new methods for understanding the complexity of these phenomena by studying societal structures and human behavior. Societies and the Social Sciences is our name for a set of courses offered by social science departments across the Faculty of Arts and Science\u2014Anthropology, Social and Cultural Analysis, Economics, Politics, History, Linguistics, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Sociology. Students fulfill the requirement by taking one of a list of designated courses or by majoring or minoring in the social sciences. Expressive Culture Art arouses pleasure, wonder, confusion, curiosity, and many other things. How is art made, and for what purpose? How do artworks convey meaning or feelings? How does social context shape the making of art? In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression by focusing on one of five media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social and political life. Our teaching is fueled by our passion for fostering life-long appreciation of the arts, and New York City is the ideal place to experience them in all their variety. Whenever possible, faculty draw on the rich cultural resources of the city around us.    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is the mathematics and natural science component of the College Core Curriculum. Rather than providing a routine coverage of facts, FSI courses stress the process and applications of quantitative and scientific thinking. The design of these courses is based on the conviction that science is interesting, accessible, and important for all undergraduates. FSI courses encourage students to approach science as a way of knowing, a quest to understand who we are and our place in the universe. They also provide you with a foundation to make informed decisions\u2014both personal and societal\u2014as citizens of a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology. No matter what career path you choose, the study of science will enrich your critical thinking skills and expand your appreciation of the natural world. Quantitative Reasoning Mathematics is both a curiosity-driven endeavor and a powerful analytical tool. Mathematics strives to deduce universal rules that govern numbers, geometry, and logic. When applied to the analysis of data, mathematics allows us to derive conclusions, for example, about the likelihood of random events or the effectiveness of medical therapies. In today\u2019s data-driven world we are constantly bombarded with numbers, from projections of the national debt to the likelihood of catching the flu, so citizens of the 21st century need an ability to critically evaluate numerical information. The Core\u2019s Quantitative Reasoning courses provide you with the mathematical foundations and analytical skills to investigate, evaluate, and draw conclusions from numerical evidence. Natural Science I Natural Science I describes a range of courses that examine the foundations of the physical sciences\u2014physics and chemistry. At its core, the physical sciences seek to understand the role of matter and energy in explaining a broad range of phenomena, such as the large scale structure of the universe and the factors that affect the earth\u2019s climate. These investigations require the application of mathematical tools to quantify and predict our complex world. Natural Science I courses examine questions at the cutting edge of scientific investigation: What fundamental insights do scientists hope to gain from the Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most complex scientific experiment ever performed? Why have astronomers propose the unseen existence of dark matter and dark energy? What do investigations into the Earth\u2019s historical climate reveal about the scope of global climate change in the 20th and 21st centuries? Do renewable energy sources provide a feasible global alternative to fossil fuels? Natural Science II Natural Science II encapsulates a variety of courses that examine the broad diversity of life sciences\u2014biology, neuroscience, and physical anthropology. We are currently witnessing an explosion of information in the life sciences, stimulated by the development of new tools such as DNA technologies, computer databases, and brain scanners. These new insights have thrust science into the forefront of social, ethical, and legal debates on such topics as stem cell research, the evidence for evolution, the preservation of biodiversity, and the neurological basis of decision making. Each Natural Science II course uses a thematic approach to introduce students to the foundations and frontiers of scientific investigation in the life sciences.

Advanced High Business Chinese - Cases from Real World \u2013 BUSF-SHU 188 \u2013 4 points                               This is the second part of a two-semester sequence for those who have studied Mandarin to the advanced level, although part 1 is NOT the prerequisite for taking part 2 or vice versa. The course is aimed to enhance students\u2019 Chinese skills in the business context and promote their understanding about the macro and micro business environment and culture in China. An approach placing more emphasis on case study is adopted along with task-based language teaching. The course is based on real-life cases from the business word. One is a multinational company which entered the Chinese market as a pioneer in the late 1970s and developed even closer ties to China in the 1990s by acquiring or partnering with the Chinese companies; five are Chinese companies that have endeavored in different ways to reach larger domestic and global markets. These cases center upon the issues of Business Globalization, M &amp; A (Mergers and Acquisition), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and Antidumping etc. Through reading and discussing these cases and performing form-focused and communicative tasks related to these cases, students will learn how to use Chinese as a \u201ccarrier of culture\u201d in a more dynamic way, thus acquiring a better understanding about China in economic and, broadly defined, cultural terms. In addition, the case study will also inspire students to explore the Chinese consumers\u2019 interest and mentality, so that they will occupy a more qualified position to explore a successful road toward \u201cdoing business in/with China.\u201d In addition to the business case analysis, supplementary reading, writing and listening exercises as well as media materials from different sources will also be provided in class or on-line. Highlights of these exercises are: Listening comprehension of business news reports on current issues as well as video recordings of television interviews and talk shows that cast successful international business leaders; analysis of the international financial markets (incl. analysis of origin, functions and conflict of interest of the investment banks); translation of business terminologies and documents, and commercial language and word processing. For students who are interested in pursuing career opportunities in Mainland China and Hong Kong, the course will teach the proper ways to compose a Chinese resume while, at the same time, introducing related job interview skills. By the end of the semester, students are expected to: (1) be equipped with the language skills to function more 2comfortably and confidently in the real business settings such as job interviews that require the Chinese language proficiency; (2) enhance the cultural awareness about the Chinese business world; (3) improve listening comprehension of Chinese business related media materials; (4) improve reading and translation skills of business terminologies/documents; (5) be able to use Chinese language software for certain business purposes.  Class will be conducted in Chinese.

Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban  development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use fieldbased studies and Geographic Information System  (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core  component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several  NYU sites globally and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.

Kang\u2019s concern would dominate intellectual debates over the twentieth century. In this course we will explore social and cultural debates in 20th-century China, focusing on topics such as Confucianism, social reform, nationalism, women empowerment, and art and literature. The questions that will guide this course include: Why did scholars like Kang Youwei and Liang Qiyao advocate reform and constitutional monarchy, while others, like Sun Yat-sen and Qiu Jin, called for revolution and the overthrow of the empire? What led to the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists? What was the May Fourth Movement about? Who are Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy? What did Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu mean when they declared classical language \u2018dead\u2019? What are Lu Xun\u2019s Diary of a Madman and Ding Ling\u2019s Miss Sophia\u2019s Diary really about? What did Mao Zedong mean when he claimed at the Yan\u2019an Forum, in 1942: \u201cThere is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake [\u2026] literature and art are the cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine\u201d? What is meant by the Cultural Fever of 1980s China? What made the \u2018hooligan\u2019 (\u6d41\u6c13) author Wang Shuo a national bestseller in the 1980s? What were the main points of debate between the New Left and the neo-Liberals in the 1990s?                                                                    20th Century East Asia - US Relations - GCHN-SHU 252 - 4 points                                This is a lecture course focusing on the changing relationship between East Asian countries and the United States in the 20th-century. On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      Voices from the Margin: Modern Chinese and Sinophone Writers - GCHN-SHU 263 - 4 points                               The literary scene in the modern and contemporary Chinese-speaking world is diverse, vast, and challenging for the migrant and exilic minds whose creative energies are often driven by their poignant insights to the turbulent events around them. Working in, outside, and between places like mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, America, and parts of Southeast Asia, Chinese-language writers ask questions about nationalism, tradition, ethno-linguistic politics, and cultural authenticity. They speak from and across multiple cultural margins to probe the nature of modernity, cross-cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. This course invites students to participate in the ongoing discursive and historiographical debates over the study of \u201cmodern Chinese literature\u201d through a fast-emerging transnational and comparative perspective. Reading stories, novels, and essays by both established and marginalized writers, we place the traditional nation-based rubric of Chinese literary studies in critical dialogues with a set of jarring historical contexts: Euro-American imperialism, Chinese emigration and their settler-colonial history, the post-1949 political split, and global decolonization movements, among others. We ask: how do writers represent China on the world stage? Where in their works can we discern stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do they variously cement or deconstruct the conventional East-West divide? What alternative literary geographies and worldviews do they offer? We begin with the satirical modernists of Republican-era China. Next, we turn to Hong Kong and Taiwan for identity debates, colonial legacies, nativism, and postmodern cultures. In light of the global migration history, we also study narratives from Chinese-speaking America, Malaysia, and Singapore to analyze how writers creatively deconstruct the notion of Chineseness. Finally, we discuss the changing terms of exclusion and inclusion of ethnic minorities in present-day Han-Chinese societies, to further expose the internal fractures within the global Sinophone cultures.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.

Social Foundations                                                  Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                                                                      Contemporary Chinese Political Thought - CCSF-SHU 123 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to perspectives on contemporary Chinese political and social thought as presented in academic publications, media reports, social commentary and postings on the Chinese Internet. It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.

Virtually all your college courses require you to write papers or reports, but courses offered by the Expository Writing Program are opportunities to concentrate intensely on the process of writing. The Expository Writing Program assumes that writing is not merely a useful skill but also a way of learning and knowing. Its courses focus on the examination of evidence, the development of ideas, and the clear expression of those ideas in a variety of different kinds of essays. In these writing courses, students routinely move from exploration to argument as they read and make use of various texts\u2014written, visual, experiential\u2014to create a spectrum of persuasive essays. Examined texts become more complex, and the writing tasks more difficult, as students grapple with intriguing questions that lead to richer ideas and more interesting forms of expression. The essays students write become more formal and argumentative as the semester\u2019s work progresses. Additional information, requirements and course descriptions appear on the Expository Writing Program website.     Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as government, business, and research. NYU is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its rapidly expanding opportunities for study abroad. To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must show or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence (see list of courses below). Some languages are also taught in intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages are encouraged to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Students of all languages, ancient or modern, are encouraged to continue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. Exemptions: Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test in a foreign language, or by passing a departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, and for Advanced Placement Test equivalencies, consult your advisor or the College of Arts and Science Bulletin (available online from the CAS website). Students whose secondary schooling was in a language other than English and other than a language offered in the College, or who complete the International Writing Workshop sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, International Writing Workshop I; and EXPOS-UA 9, International Writing Workshop II), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the B.S./B.E. program. In addition to the foreign languages courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportunities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, non-credit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909.\u2028    Foreign Language Courses Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available. Completion of any of the following courses will fulfill the foreign language requirement. Please consult the individual departmental listings for information on prerequisite courses.

For more information on specific language classes, placement, or exemption, please contact the language coordinator, director of language programs, or director of undergraduate studies named in the individual departmental listings. Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Catalan, Czech (Elementary I and II are offered in the College; intermediate-level courses are offered at Columbia), Dutch, Finnish, Georgian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Kannada, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908 or click here for more information.    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture is the arts, humanities, and social sciences component of the College Core Curriculum. Within each of its components, students are free to pursue their interests through their choice of classes. The structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information below, to learn more about FCC courses, we strongly recommend that you browse past and present syllabuses. Texts and Ideas Texts and Ideas is the name for a diverse group of humanities courses that study challenging, influential texts about big ideas: freedom, the nature of the soul, the place of humans in the natural and animal world, beauty, citizenship, morality, the imagination, the use of the past, and many more. Some courses explore a single theme or a set of closely related ideas; others investigate the relationship between two periods of intellectual history, for example, selected writings in the philosophy and literature of ancient Greece and Rome and their reception in a later era. Texts and Ideas courses also seek to refine students\u2019 ability to write and speak about complex concepts and arguments with clarity, originality, and eloquence. You will be challenged not only to master the content of some of the world\u2019s most influential philosophical texts and works of literature, but to discuss how the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropriated, or rejected over time. Cultures and Contexts Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways humans see themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional groups. Individual courses focus on political, social, or cultural collectives that are distinct from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America, such as central Asia, Russia, Korea, or ancient Egypt; some courses study diaspora formations and emergent traditions. Primary texts are central to every course, with some faculty concentrating on historical documents, others on art, film, or literary texts. Cultures and Contexts courses share a common aim to examine the ways cultures emerge and interact through trade, colonization, immigration, religious proselytization, and representation in various media; how groups define themselves through beliefs, values, and customs; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects comprehension of the ways in which premodern or non-Western peoples experience and imagine their lives.  Societies and the Social Sciences We live in a world molded by massive social, political, and economic transformations, and to be thoughtful, responsible citizens we need to understand them. From the nineteenth century to today, drawing on earlier movements, thinkers have developed new methods for understanding the complexity of these phenomena by studying societal structures and human behavior. Societies and the Social Sciences is our name for a set of courses offered by social science departments across the Faculty of Arts and Science\u2014Anthropology, Social and Cultural Analysis, Economics, Politics, History, Linguistics, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Sociology. Students fulfill the requirement by taking one of a list of designated courses or by majoring or minoring in the social sciences. Expressive Culture Art arouses pleasure, wonder, confusion, curiosity, and many other things. How is art made, and for what purpose? How do artworks convey meaning or feelings? How does social context shape the making of art? In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression by focusing on one of five media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social and political life. Our teaching is fueled by our passion for fostering life-long appreciation of the arts, and New York City is the ideal place to experience them in all their variety. Whenever possible, faculty draw on the rich cultural resources of the city around us.    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is the mathematics and natural science component of the College Core Curriculum. Rather than providing a routine coverage of facts, FSI courses stress the process and applications of quantitative and scientific thinking. The design of these courses is based on the conviction that science is interesting, accessible, and important for all undergraduates. FSI courses encourage students to approach science as a way of knowing, a quest to understand who we are and our place in the universe. They also provide you with a foundation to make informed decisions\u2014both personal and societal\u2014as citizens of a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology. No matter what career path you choose, the study of science will enrich your critical thinking skills and expand your appreciation of the natural world. Quantitative Reasoning Mathematics is both a curiosity-driven endeavor and a powerful analytical tool. Mathematics strives to deduce universal rules that govern numbers, geometry, and logic. When applied to the analysis of data, mathematics allows us to derive conclusions, for example, about the likelihood of random events or the effectiveness of medical therapies. In today\u2019s data-driven world we are constantly bombarded with numbers, from projections of the national debt to the likelihood of catching the flu, so citizens of the 21st century need an ability to critically evaluate numerical information. The Core\u2019s Quantitative Reasoning courses provide you with the mathematical foundations and analytical skills to investigate, evaluate, and draw conclusions from numerical evidence. Natural Science I Natural Science I describes a range of courses that examine the foundations of the physical sciences\u2014physics and chemistry. At its core, the physical sciences seek to understand the role of matter and energy in explaining a broad range of phenomena, such as the large scale structure of the universe and the factors that affect the earth\u2019s climate. These investigations require the application of mathematical tools to quantify and predict our complex world. Natural Science I courses examine questions at the cutting edge of scientific investigation: What fundamental insights do scientists hope to gain from the Large Hadron Collider, the largest and most complex scientific experiment ever performed? Why have astronomers propose the unseen existence of dark matter and dark energy? What do investigations into the Earth\u2019s historical climate reveal about the scope of global climate change in the 20th and 21st centuries? Do renewable energy sources provide a feasible global alternative to fossil fuels? Natural Science II Natural Science II encapsulates a variety of courses that examine the broad diversity of life sciences\u2014biology, neuroscience, and physical anthropology. We are currently witnessing an explosion of information in the life sciences, stimulated by the development of new tools such as DNA technologies, computer databases, and brain scanners. These new insights have thrust science into the forefront of social, ethical, and legal debates on such topics as stem cell research, the evidence for evolution, the preservation of biodiversity, and the neurological basis of decision making. Each Natural Science II course uses a thematic approach to introduce students to the foundations and frontiers of scientific investigation in the life sciences.

Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?
