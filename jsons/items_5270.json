Performances complicate and enliven our experience of communication, and incredible performances will remain in our minds long after their original event. At the front and center of any performance is the performer; but other factors contribute to the staging of a performance . In this course we will explore the multiple dimensions of musical performance. We will begin by reading theories of performance while developing a practical methodology for descriptive musical analysis based on close listening. We will compare recordings of similar music by different performances and listen to interviews to gain insight into how performers approach music. Next, we will examine the relationship between the performer, composer and the score in classical music. Finally, we will break away from individual artistic agents to consider the influence of material and social factors such as instruments, acoustics, electronic technology and concert cultures upon musical performances. No background in music theory and notation is assumed or required.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. The Art of Listening: Vienna 1900 - MUSIC-UA 3 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Anna Stoll-Knecht    This course will explore modes of listening within a particular context: Vienna at the turn of the twentieth century. During one semester, we will immerse ourselves in this specific place, at a fascinating moment in history, that witnessed extremely productive exchanges between the arts, as well as between the arts and sciences. Beginning with general questions about listening (How do we listen today? Do we need \"training\" to listen?), we will then turn to practices of listening to music, and discuss how \"listening\" relates to \"analyzing,\" and to \"understanding.\" At this point we will travel to Vienna (with our minds) and set up the context of our exploration. Circulating between visual arts, music, architecture, literature, theater, we will use this material to think further about different modes of listening: how is listening to a Mahler symphony in a concert hall different from listening to a show in a Viennese cabaret, or to a marching band in the streets? What does it change to listen to music with words (opera, operetta, songs) and to music without words (symphony), or to watch a silent movie, without words but with music? Music was everywhere in Vienna at this time (streets, caf \u00e9s, cabarets, parks), and it was part of the everyday life of everyone. Its development was nurtured by collaborations with painters (Sch \u00f6 nberg and Kandinsky, for example) or writers (Strauss and Hofmannstahl, Srauss and Zweig). The richness of this unique context will allow us to address fundamental questions concerning different ways of listening - including an incursion into the psychoanalytical practice of listening. Listening to music with a moving image (with or without words) will constitute one of the main threads of this class, starting with German movies of the 1930's (Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg) up to Orson Welles, Max Oph \u00fcls, Alfred Hitchcock, Luchino Visconti and Stanley Kubrick - each movie being related to Vienna 1900 in some way.    There will be at least two guest lectures, for the sake of diversity; and for lack of being able to travel to Vienna for real, we will spend a class at the Neue Galerie on 86th Street, where one can drink a Viennese coffee, eat a Sacher torte, view some paintings, read the newspaper, and enjoy a true Viennese experience.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. Elements of Music - MUSIC-UA 20 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 320) Please refer to Albert for lab sections Instructor: TBA Explores the underlying principles and inner workings of the tonal system, a system that has guided all of Western music from the years 1600 to 1900. It includes a discussion of historical background and evolution. The focus is on concepts and notation of key, scale, tonality, and rhythm. Related skills in sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard harmony are stressed in the recitation sections.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors, but can be taken as part of the requirements for a Music Minor.    Topics in 20th Century Music: The Long 19th Century - Sixty Glorious Years, 1876-1936 - MUSIC-UA 111 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller The historical narrative of the \"long century,\" as defined by Eric Hobsbawm, a British Marxist historian and author, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. This idea of the \"long century\" when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, this period is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition - and frequently unruly first performances - of Schoenberg's Second String Quartet, Verkl \u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky's Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Alban Berg, Anton von Webern, and B \u00e9la Bart \u00f3k. Richard Strauss's operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with Franz L  \u00e9har's The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus's The Chocolate Soldier , while practically the whole major output of Charles Ives was produced in isolation. Busoni published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music in 1907, and Luigi Russolo issued his \"Futurist Manifesto\" in 1913, shortly before the European continental conflagration began. It was the period of The Mikado, Madama Butterfly, Das Lied von der Erde, Pomp and Circumstance , as well as the Maple-Leaf Rag and Tin-Pan Alley.    This class will explore the ISMS most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes, music evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety - change and progress that turns on itself - will form the core of the class. We will examine traditional musical materials and modes of expression and the radical central problem of dissolving tonality associated with Schoenberg's \"emancipation of dissonance.\" In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \"fin-de-si \u00e8 cle\") and Paris (the positive \"la belle \u00c9 poque\"), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der blaue Reiter, Die Br \u00fc cke , the Fauves, L'art nouveau , and Cubisme .    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\" The Wagner Operas: Sex, Drugs, Felonies, and Fallacies - MUSIC-UA 136 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller Richard Wagner's music, words, themes, images, gestures, and intent, were the stuff of nation-building that wrought havoc with the status-quo, havoc with which we are still dealing to this day. While his musical influence is unmistakeable, the ramifications of his political and social activities spread across the face of Europe from 1848 through to, arguably, 1914--and even to the present day, with the Wagner descendants front and center. This course will examine the tumultuous musical, political, and social milieus surrounding Wagner's oeuvre--musician, poet, impresario, political activist, and lightening rod for the unification of Germany. Wagner was wrapped up in the the importance of German history, especially at this pivotal time in the 19th century. He paid dearly with exile and isolation for his political activities during the 1849 Dresden uprising, and his uncompromising belief in the supremacy of everything German supported Bismarck as the newly-unified nation sought to establish itself as the equal, if not the better, of long-standing imperial regimes (Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, Spain). He was afforded by King Ludwig of Bavaria untold influence over major decisions in Munich concerning the appointment and function of ministers and other officials, until his actions stepped over the line. Inspired by his own innovative ideas of a total musical experience ( Gesamtkunstwerk : his term, not one he ultimately disavowed), the course will look at all the components he thought important: the small details (the way Leitmotives work), the construction of the larger whole (librettos, staging, rigging, and theater design), and the notion of operatic performance at the time and its presentation to the public in terms of voice production and instrumentation.    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\" Anthropology of Music: Music and Language - MUSIC-UA 153 (section 001) Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:30-1:45 (Room TBA) Instructor: Lauren Ninoshvili Music and language are intertwined, universal aspects of human communication, expression, and social life. This course draws on methods of sociocultural, musical, and linguistic analysis to explore practices at the intersection of music, language, and the human voice - both popular and elite, contemporary and historic, Western and non-Western.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 7: \"Analytical and Critical Thinking\"    Anthropology of Music: Native American Music and Poetics - MUSIC-UA 153 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 11:00-12:15 (Room TBA) Instructor: David Samuels One could argue, in a sense, that American Anthropology and Ethnomusicology were built on a scaffolding of fascination with the expressive culture of Native Americans. In any case, understandings and misunderstandings of Native American musical and poetic practices have keyed the development of scholarly approaches to world music for more than a century. In this course we will explore the ways that ethnographic encounters with Native American music and poetry have informed notions of human culture, society, and creativity. Exploration of contemporary work will help us judge the state of the art today.    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\"    Proseminar in Musical Research - MUSIC-UA 200 Monday &amp; Wednesday 3:30-4:45 (Silver 218) Instructor: Stanley Boorman This course is required of all Honors students in the department. It is a seminar discussing recent ideas and issues in all areas of musical research, musicology, ethnomusicology, and theory. Faculty members in the department will introduce different topics, discussing the ideas and their application, so that by the end of the semester students will be capable of undertaking the advanced research project required for an Honors degree.    This course is required for all Honors Students    Harmony &amp; Counterpoint I - MUSIC-UA 201 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00 - 12:15 (Silver 318) Additional recitation section required - please refer to Albert for times Instructor: TBA General principles underlying tonal musical organization. Students learn concepts of 18th- and 19th- century harmonic, formal, and contrapuntal practices. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship and are required throughout the sequence.    Fulfills the requirement of Course 1: \"Harmony and Counterpoint\" Harmony and Counterpoint II - MUSIC-UA 202 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 318) Additional recitation section required - please refer to Albert for times Instructor: TBA A continuation following Harmony and Counterpoint I: General principles underlying tonal musical organization. Students learn concepts of 18th- and 19th-century harmonic, formal, and contrapuntal practices. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 4: \"Creating Music.\" This course (or Principles of Composition) is a prerequisite for advanced courses in composition.    Principles of Musical Analysis: Aural Perception - MUSIC-UA 209 Monday &amp; Wednesday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: J. Martin Daughtry \"Aural Perception\" is a comprehensive introduction to the dynamics of sound and listening in multiple contexts and registers. Through listening exercises, class discussion, and creative work, students learn how to: (1) discern and analyze musical structures, styles, and other features; (2) explore the relationship between sound (including work of different repertoires) and notation; and (3) think critically about the roles sound and listening play in their lives. This course is a requirement for all music majors. There are no prerequisites, but students must secure permission from the music department before enrolling.    Fulfills the requirement for Course 2: \"Aural Perception\"    Principles of Composition - MUSIC-UA 307 Tuesday 3:30-6:00 (Room TBA) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman This class in composition includes the study of selected contemporary compositions, toward 1) developing a shared language for talking about compositional practice and sonic art; and 2) toward appreciating the range of musical expression that has been enabled by certain avant-garde practices, including new degrees of freedom, and new attitudes about music as conceptual art. We will look in particular at three genres of compositions - those for human body sounds; those for performance on homemade instruments; and those written for a cappella voice.    In the second part of the course we will explore composition for fixed media, i.e., electroacoustic media, or fixed media coordinated with one of the three categories above. Fixed media examples we will study in class include pieces whose source material is spoken text. Finally, we will explore the use of selected and relatively simple live processing techniques (such as reverb and delay) as means by which to expand acoustic resources. The focus here will be on compositional ideation, and on sound as a signifier; psychoacoustics and the perceptual qualities of sound; and musical memory. Very limited attention will be devoted in this course to developing technical expertise in computer music. Throughout the course we will consider how some of the limitations of these non-traditional instruments and of fixed media are simultaneously points of expanded expressive potential.    The course will (most often) culminate in a Music Department concert in which all student works will be presented. This course serves as a prerequisite for the department's Advanced Composition course in cases where a student has not taken Harmony and Counterpoint II.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 4: \"Creating Music.\" This course (or Harmony and Counterpoint II) is a prerequisite for advanced courses in composition.    Special Topics Seminar: Synths, Samplers, Drum Machines, Effects Processors, and Beyond - Programming in Pd - MUSIC-UA 901 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00-12:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Jaime Oliver Technological devices have shaped the evolution of popular music. Imagine Hendrix playing on an acoustic guitar, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds played on a piano, electronic dance music played by a rock band, hip hop without turntables and samplers. These technologies and the music made with them are inseparable. In this course, we will learn to program computers to make music using the open source programming environment Pure Data (Pd), by emulating some of the technologies that defined popular music in the second half of the 20th century. As we move through the course content, we will learn concepts in digital audio and acoustics, and explore the work of artists, their music, machines, and the ideas that fostered and resulted from them.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 3: \"Sonic Materials of Music\" Internship - MUSIC-UA 981 (2-4 credits) Open to music majors, in each case with permission from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. Independent Study - MUSIC-UA 998 Seniors majoring in music who, in the opinion of the department, possess unusual ability are permitted to carry on individual work in a selected specialized area under the supervision of a department faculty member. This course fulfills a requirement for Music Majors who are pursuing Honors.  *Undergraduate and Graduate students may enroll in this course Collegium Musicum - MUSIC-GA 1002 (2 credits) Friday 2:00-4:00 (Silver 220) Instructor: Margaret Panofsky Students receive weekly private viol lessons, the time arranged with the professor. When proficient, they play in a viol ensemble. The FAS Music Department lends students a viol and bow from its collection. Qualified students may play with The Teares of the Muses, an ensemble affiliated with the NYU Music Department. The group performs on- and off-campus.

Berkley, NYU Presidential Search Committee Chair     I am writing to follow up on last week's message regarding opportunities for the Presidential Search Committee to hear directly from various stakeholders at the University. We have arranged for several listening sessions, organized so different segments of our community can convey their feedback directly to committee members.   Initial dates and times for faculty, administrators/staff, and students in the NYC area are listed below. The Committee fully appreciates that schedules are pressed during this time of year, but hopes that you will make every effort to attend and share your perspectives on what you see as the challenges facing the next president; what previous experience would best prepare someone for this role; and, finally, what we need to do as a community to help ensure that the next president will be successful in leading NYU forward. Please note that we are also working on scheduling opportunities for colleagues in NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai to engage in this conversation.   As always, feel free to email the committee as well at nyupresident.search.committee@nyu.ed to share your thoughts at any time. Thank you once again for your commitment to NYU, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Performances complicate and enliven our experience of communication, and incredible performances will remain in our minds long after their original event. At the front and center of any performance is the performer; but other factors contribute to the staging of a performance . In this course we will explore the multiple dimensions of musical performance. We will begin by reading theories of performance while developing a practical methodology for descriptive musical analysis based on close listening. We will compare recordings of similar music by different performances and listen to interviews to gain insight into how performers approach music. Next, we will examine the relationship between the performer, composer and the score in classical music. Finally, we will break away from individual artistic agents to consider the influence of material and social factors such as instruments, acoustics, electronic technology and concert cultures upon musical performances. No background in music theory and notation is assumed or required.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. The Art of Listening: Vienna 1900 - MUSIC-UA 3 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Anna Stoll-Knecht    This course will explore modes of listening within a particular context: Vienna at the turn of the twentieth century. During one semester, we will immerse ourselves in this specific place, at a fascinating moment in history, that witnessed extremely productive exchanges between the arts, as well as between the arts and sciences. Beginning with general questions about listening (How do we listen today? Do we need \"training\" to listen?), we will then turn to practices of listening to music, and discuss how \"listening\" relates to \"analyzing,\" and to \"understanding.\" At this point we will travel to Vienna (with our minds) and set up the context of our exploration. Circulating between visual arts, music, architecture, literature, theater, we will use this material to think further about different modes of listening: how is listening to a Mahler symphony in a concert hall different from listening to a show in a Viennese cabaret, or to a marching band in the streets? What does it change to listen to music with words (opera, operetta, songs) and to music without words (symphony), or to watch a silent movie, without words but with music? Music was everywhere in Vienna at this time (streets, caf \u00e9s, cabarets, parks), and it was part of the everyday life of everyone. Its development was nurtured by collaborations with painters (Sch \u00f6 nberg and Kandinsky, for example) or writers (Strauss and Hofmannstahl, Srauss and Zweig). The richness of this unique context will allow us to address fundamental questions concerning different ways of listening - including an incursion into the psychoanalytical practice of listening. Listening to music with a moving image (with or without words) will constitute one of the main threads of this class, starting with German movies of the 1930's (Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg) up to Orson Welles, Max Oph \u00fcls, Alfred Hitchcock, Luchino Visconti and Stanley Kubrick - each movie being related to Vienna 1900 in some way.    There will be at least two guest lectures, for the sake of diversity; and for lack of being able to travel to Vienna for real, we will spend a class at the Neue Galerie on 86th Street, where one can drink a Viennese coffee, eat a Sacher torte, view some paintings, read the newspaper, and enjoy a true Viennese experience.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. Elements of Music - MUSIC-UA 20 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 320) Please refer to Albert for lab sections Instructor: TBA Explores the underlying principles and inner workings of the tonal system, a system that has guided all of Western music from the years 1600 to 1900. It includes a discussion of historical background and evolution. The focus is on concepts and notation of key, scale, tonality, and rhythm. Related skills in sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard harmony are stressed in the recitation sections.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors, but can be taken as part of the requirements for a Music Minor.    Topics in 20th Century Music: The Long 19th Century - Sixty Glorious Years, 1876-1936 - MUSIC-UA 111 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller The historical narrative of the \"long century,\" as defined by Eric Hobsbawm, a British Marxist historian and author, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. This idea of the \"long century\" when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, this period is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition - and frequently unruly first performances - of Schoenberg's Second String Quartet, Verkl \u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky's Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Alban Berg, Anton von Webern, and B \u00e9la Bart \u00f3k. Richard Strauss's operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with Franz L  \u00e9har's The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus's The Chocolate Soldier , while practically the whole major output of Charles Ives was produced in isolation. Busoni published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music in 1907, and Luigi Russolo issued his \"Futurist Manifesto\" in 1913, shortly before the European continental conflagration began. It was the period of The Mikado, Madama Butterfly, Das Lied von der Erde, Pomp and Circumstance , as well as the Maple-Leaf Rag and Tin-Pan Alley.    This class will explore the ISMS most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes, music evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety - change and progress that turns on itself - will form the core of the class. We will examine traditional musical materials and modes of expression and the radical central problem of dissolving tonality associated with Schoenberg's \"emancipation of dissonance.\" In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \"fin-de-si \u00e8 cle\") and Paris (the positive \"la belle \u00c9 poque\"), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der blaue Reiter, Die Br \u00fc cke , the Fauves, L'art nouveau , and Cubisme .    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\" The Wagner Operas: Sex, Drugs, Felonies, and Fallacies - MUSIC-UA 136 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller Richard Wagner's music, words, themes, images, gestures, and intent, were the stuff of nation-building that wrought havoc with the status-quo, havoc with which we are still dealing to this day. While his musical influence is unmistakeable, the ramifications of his political and social activities spread across the face of Europe from 1848 through to, arguably, 1914--and even to the present day, with the Wagner descendants front and center. This course will examine the tumultuous musical, political, and social milieus surrounding Wagner's oeuvre--musician, poet, impresario, political activist, and lightening rod for the unification of Germany. Wagner was wrapped up in the the importance of German history, especially at this pivotal time in the 19th century. He paid dearly with exile and isolation for his political activities during the 1849 Dresden uprising, and his uncompromising belief in the supremacy of everything German supported Bismarck as the newly-unified nation sought to establish itself as the equal, if not the better, of long-standing imperial regimes (Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, Spain). He was afforded by King Ludwig of Bavaria untold influence over major decisions in Munich concerning the appointment and function of ministers and other officials, until his actions stepped over the line. Inspired by his own innovative ideas of a total musical experience ( Gesamtkunstwerk : his term, not one he ultimately disavowed), the course will look at all the components he thought important: the small details (the way Leitmotives work), the construction of the larger whole (librettos, staging, rigging, and theater design), and the notion of operatic performance at the time and its presentation to the public in terms of voice production and instrumentation.    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\" Anthropology of Music: Music and Language - MUSIC-UA 153 (section 001) Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:30-1:45 (Room TBA) Instructor: Lauren Ninoshvili Music and language are intertwined, universal aspects of human communication, expression, and social life. This course draws on methods of sociocultural, musical, and linguistic analysis to explore practices at the intersection of music, language, and the human voice - both popular and elite, contemporary and historic, Western and non-Western.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 7: \"Analytical and Critical Thinking\"    Anthropology of Music: Native American Music and Poetics - MUSIC-UA 153 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 11:00-12:15 (Room TBA) Instructor: David Samuels One could argue, in a sense, that American Anthropology and Ethnomusicology were built on a scaffolding of fascination with the expressive culture of Native Americans. In any case, understandings and misunderstandings of Native American musical and poetic practices have keyed the development of scholarly approaches to world music for more than a century. In this course we will explore the ways that ethnographic encounters with Native American music and poetry have informed notions of human culture, society, and creativity. Exploration of contemporary work will help us judge the state of the art today.    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\"    Proseminar in Musical Research - MUSIC-UA 200 Monday &amp; Wednesday 3:30-4:45 (Silver 218) Instructor: Stanley Boorman This course is required of all Honors students in the department. It is a seminar discussing recent ideas and issues in all areas of musical research, musicology, ethnomusicology, and theory. Faculty members in the department will introduce different topics, discussing the ideas and their application, so that by the end of the semester students will be capable of undertaking the advanced research project required for an Honors degree.    This course is required for all Honors Students    Harmony &amp; Counterpoint I - MUSIC-UA 201 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00 - 12:15 (Silver 318) Additional recitation section required - please refer to Albert for times Instructor: TBA General principles underlying tonal musical organization. Students learn concepts of 18th- and 19th- century harmonic, formal, and contrapuntal practices. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship and are required throughout the sequence.    Fulfills the requirement of Course 1: \"Harmony and Counterpoint\" Harmony and Counterpoint II - MUSIC-UA 202 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 318) Additional recitation section required - please refer to Albert for times Instructor: TBA A continuation following Harmony and Counterpoint I: General principles underlying tonal musical organization. Students learn concepts of 18th- and 19th-century harmonic, formal, and contrapuntal practices. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 4: \"Creating Music.\" This course (or Principles of Composition) is a prerequisite for advanced courses in composition.    Principles of Musical Analysis: Aural Perception - MUSIC-UA 209 Monday &amp; Wednesday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: J. Martin Daughtry \"Aural Perception\" is a comprehensive introduction to the dynamics of sound and listening in multiple contexts and registers. Through listening exercises, class discussion, and creative work, students learn how to: (1) discern and analyze musical structures, styles, and other features; (2) explore the relationship between sound (including work of different repertoires) and notation; and (3) think critically about the roles sound and listening play in their lives. This course is a requirement for all music majors. There are no prerequisites, but students must secure permission from the music department before enrolling.    Fulfills the requirement for Course 2: \"Aural Perception\"    Principles of Composition - MUSIC-UA 307 Tuesday 3:30-6:00 (Room TBA) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman This class in composition includes the study of selected contemporary compositions, toward 1) developing a shared language for talking about compositional practice and sonic art; and 2) toward appreciating the range of musical expression that has been enabled by certain avant-garde practices, including new degrees of freedom, and new attitudes about music as conceptual art. We will look in particular at three genres of compositions - those for human body sounds; those for performance on homemade instruments; and those written for a cappella voice.    In the second part of the course we will explore composition for fixed media, i.e., electroacoustic media, or fixed media coordinated with one of the three categories above. Fixed media examples we will study in class include pieces whose source material is spoken text. Finally, we will explore the use of selected and relatively simple live processing techniques (such as reverb and delay) as means by which to expand acoustic resources. The focus here will be on compositional ideation, and on sound as a signifier; psychoacoustics and the perceptual qualities of sound; and musical memory. Very limited attention will be devoted in this course to developing technical expertise in computer music. Throughout the course we will consider how some of the limitations of these non-traditional instruments and of fixed media are simultaneously points of expanded expressive potential.    The course will (most often) culminate in a Music Department concert in which all student works will be presented. This course serves as a prerequisite for the department's Advanced Composition course in cases where a student has not taken Harmony and Counterpoint II.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 4: \"Creating Music.\" This course (or Harmony and Counterpoint II) is a prerequisite for advanced courses in composition.    Special Topics Seminar: Synths, Samplers, Drum Machines, Effects Processors, and Beyond - Programming in Pd - MUSIC-UA 901 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00-12:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Jaime Oliver Technological devices have shaped the evolution of popular music. Imagine Hendrix playing on an acoustic guitar, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds played on a piano, electronic dance music played by a rock band, hip hop without turntables and samplers. These technologies and the music made with them are inseparable. In this course, we will learn to program computers to make music using the open source programming environment Pure Data (Pd), by emulating some of the technologies that defined popular music in the second half of the 20th century. As we move through the course content, we will learn concepts in digital audio and acoustics, and explore the work of artists, their music, machines, and the ideas that fostered and resulted from them.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 3: \"Sonic Materials of Music\" Internship - MUSIC-UA 981 (2-4 credits) Open to music majors, in each case with permission from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. Independent Study - MUSIC-UA 998 Seniors majoring in music who, in the opinion of the department, possess unusual ability are permitted to carry on individual work in a selected specialized area under the supervision of a department faculty member. This course fulfills a requirement for Music Majors who are pursuing Honors.  *Undergraduate and Graduate students may enroll in this course Collegium Musicum - MUSIC-GA 1002 (2 credits) Friday 2:00-4:00 (Silver 220) Instructor: Margaret Panofsky Students receive weekly private viol lessons, the time arranged with the professor. When proficient, they play in a viol ensemble. The FAS Music Department lends students a viol and bow from its collection. Qualified students may play with The Teares of the Muses, an ensemble affiliated with the NYU Music Department. The group performs on- and off-campus. Requirements to enroll in the course are previous vocal or instrumental training on any instrument - not limited to strings - and good musicianship skills. This course may fulfill an elective requirement for Music Majors and Minors, as a portion of the 4 credits of performance that are allowable toward the major or minor.
