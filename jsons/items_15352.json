However you are not limited to taking the courses listed on this page. You should use this page, in additional to HKU\u2019s course listings , to help you prepare a preliminary list and backup list of courses you want to take abroad. Please note: You can take a maximum of two classes per major/concentration during your IBEX semester. Also, Accounting courses cannot be taken abroad for credit toward the Accounting or CPA majors/concentrations.    There is no guarantee that the courses listed here will be offered during the specific semester you study abroad. Once HKU publishes its confirmed courses for the semester you will be attending, you can revise your list as needed based on what is actually being offered. If you see a course on HKUs website that you would like to take, but it is not listed here, you can submit the syllabus to Stern\u2019s International Exchanges &amp; Special Programs team for approval. If the course is approved you will be notified and it will be added to the list of courses below. If a course is already listed here as approved, it does not need to be reviewed or approved again.
