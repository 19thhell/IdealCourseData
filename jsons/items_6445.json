Description       All you need is love, love makes the world go around, and love is a battlefield, so the songs tell us. What kinds of love are essential to our well-being, and why does love so often go wrong? This course will examine friendship, romance and marriage, and parenthood as forms of love that are very personal and yet have social rules of their own, sometimes unspoken. We will use a selection of philosophical, sociological and literary texts to see what they contribute to our understanding of how love and trouble sometimes go together. Readings might include selections from Aristotle on friendship, Dan Savage on parental love, a history of marriage, and the postmodern theorist Roland Barthes\u2019\u00a0 A Lover\u2019s Discourse \u00a0; literary texts include drama by Neil LaBute, memoir by Jamaica Kincaid, fiction by Jane Smiley and Yukio Mishima, and poetry by Anne Sexton. Discussing what we think and feel about these representations of love will serve as the springboard for developing students\u2019 writing on the subject. Students will compose descriptive and critical essays and workshop their writing in multiple drafts.

Description       Friedrich Nietzsche likened the flourishing of amorous feeling to the educative process of gradually accommodating oneself to a strange melody, remarking that, \u201clove, too, has to be learned.\u201d In this course, the rich western tradition of thinking about love in pedagogical terms will serve as a departure point for discussion, research, and critical writing. Our focus will be not only on the ways in which love has been conceived as a discipline\u2014an ars amatoria\u2014that one aims to master but also on the ways in which love, as an emergent phenomenon, instructs us in arenas of personal or spiritual development, social interaction, and political engagement. Students will assemble personalized archives based on their areas of particular interest and undertake a series of writing assignments. The final project will comprise an extended research-based investigation into an issue of each student\u2019s choosing. Topics of weekly discussion will include: conceptions of Eros in Plato\u2019s philosophy; the question of \u201cauthentic\u201d love in the work of Simone de Beauvoir; representations of queer love in the work of Jean Genet, Samuel Delany, and Sharon Hayes; the contemporary debate about love as a political category in the work of Michael Hardt and Lauren Berlant.

Description       All you need is love, love makes the world go around, and love is a battlefield, so the songs tell us. What kinds of love are essential to our well-being, and why does love so often go wrong? This course will examine friendship, romance and marriage, and parenthood as forms of love that are very personal and yet have social rules of their own, sometimes unspoken. We will use a selection of philosophical, sociological and literary texts to see what they contribute to our understanding of how love and trouble sometimes go together. Readings might include selections from Aristotle on friendship, Dan Savage on parental love, a history of marriage, and the postmodern theorist Roland Barthes\u2019\u00a0 A Lover\u2019s Discourse \u00a0; literary texts include drama by Neil LaBute, memoir by Jamaica Kincaid, fiction by Jane Smiley and Yukio Mishima, and poetry by Anne Sexton. Discussing what we think and feel about these representations of love will serve as the springboard for developing students\u2019 writing on the subject. Students will compose descriptive and critical essays and workshop their writing in multiple drafts.

Description       Friedrich Nietzsche likened the flourishing of amorous feeling to the educative process of gradually accommodating oneself to a strange melody, remarking that, \u201clove, too, has to be learned.\u201d In this course, the rich western tradition of thinking about love in pedagogical terms will serve as a departure point for discussion, research, and critical writing. Our focus will be not only on the ways in which love has been conceived as a discipline\u2014an ars amatoria\u2014that one aims to master but also on the ways in which love, as an emergent phenomenon, instructs us in arenas of personal or spiritual development, social interaction, and political engagement. Students will assemble personalized archives based on their areas of particular interest and undertake a series of writing assignments. The final project will comprise an extended research-based investigation into an issue of each student\u2019s choosing. Topics of weekly discussion will include: conceptions of Eros in Plato\u2019s philosophy; the question of \u201cauthentic\u201d love in the work of Simone de Beauvoir; representations of queer love in the work of Jean Genet, Samuel Delany, and Sharon Hayes; the contemporary debate about love as a political category in the work of Michael Hardt and Lauren Berlant.
