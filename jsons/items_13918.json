You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Application Fee  The NYU Common Application includes a non-refundable application fee . Students who are unable to pay the application fee must request a fee waiver .   Submitting the Common Application  Both your Common Application and your Writing Supplement (as well as your application fee or fee waiver request) must be successfully submitted together in advance of the application deadline for you to be eligible for admission.   You should not complete the Common Application if ...  you are applying to the Dental Hygiene program, the second bachelor\u2019s degree in Nursing, or the second bachelor\u2019s degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering. For information on applying to these programs, please visit the pages below:     Second Bachelor's degree in Nursing     Second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering     Dental Hygiene programs at the College of Dentistry     Checking Your Application Status  All applicants will receive confirmation of receipt of their applications within three weeks after our application deadlines. With your confirmation, we will provide you with instructions on how to track the status your application credentials online.   Standardized Testing Requirements   Our standardized testing requirements vary depending on whether you are a freshman or transfer applicant. Please review our Standardized Testing Policy for freshmen or transfers before submitting your application. English language testing may also be required if English is not your native language.   Submitting Materials   Please do not submit diplomas or original copies of records that cannot be replaced. NYU does not return documents you provide in support of your application.   Unless you are applying to one of the programs that specifically requires an audition or portfolio, supplementary materials will not be considered by the admissions committee. Supplementary materials include DVDs, CDs, books, pictures, newspaper articles, magazine articles, certificates, writing samples, the Common Application Arts Supplement, artistic portfolios, etc.   Interviews   NYU occasionally invites candidates to interview with us via Skype or similar video technology, but we do not offer on-campus interviews for any of our applicants. If you are invited to interview with us, we will contact you directly.   Applicants who are competitive for admission to NYU Abu Dhabi and/or NYU Shanghai may be invited to participate in our Candidate Weekends/Days. During the programs, prospective students are invited to visit campus and meet with current students, faculty, and administrators.   Applicants cannot request an interview or an invitation to a Candidate Weekend/Day.   Application Review   If anything is missing from your application file, we will offer you a limited window in which to provide the outstanding information.   Once your application is complete, it will be thoroughly reviewed by our admissions committee. We have no set formulas that we follow when we review applications, because we actively seek a mix of students who have a variety of interests, talents, and goals. If you are applying for admission to a program that requires an artistic review by our faculty, the results of that review will also be evaluated before an admissions decision is rendered.   Admissions officers personally review every application we receive\u2014there are no cutoffs for admission, and every applicant is considered holistically.

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Please review our Standardized Testing Policy for freshmen or transfers before submitting your application. English language testing may also be required if English is not your native language.   Submitting Materials   Please do not submit diplomas or original copies of records that cannot be replaced. NYU does not return documents you provide in support of your application.

If you are invited to interview with us, we will contact you directly.

Applicants cannot request an interview or an invitation to a Candidate Weekend/Day.

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Application Fee  The NYU Common Application includes a non-refundable application fee . Students who are unable to pay the application fee must request a fee waiver .   Submitting the Common Application  Both your Common Application and your Writing Supplement (as well as your application fee or fee waiver request) must be successfully submitted together in advance of the application deadline for you to be eligible for admission.   You should not complete the Common Application if ...  you are applying to the Dental Hygiene program, the second bachelor\u2019s degree in Nursing, or the second bachelor\u2019s degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering. For information on applying to these programs, please visit the pages below:     Second Bachelor's degree in Nursing     Second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering     Dental Hygiene programs at the College of Dentistry     Checking Your Application Status  All applicants will receive confirmation of receipt of their applications within three weeks after our application deadlines. With your confirmation, we will provide you with instructions on how to track the status your application credentials online.   Standardized Testing Requirements   Our standardized testing requirements vary depending on whether you are a freshman or transfer applicant. Please review our Standardized Testing Policy for freshmen or transfers before submitting your application. English language testing may also be required if English is not your native language.   Submitting Materials   Please do not submit diplomas or original copies of records that cannot be replaced. NYU does not return documents you provide in support of your application.   Unless you are applying to one of the programs that specifically requires an audition or portfolio, supplementary materials will not be considered by the admissions committee. Supplementary materials include DVDs, CDs, books, pictures, newspaper articles, magazine articles, certificates, writing samples, the Common Application Arts Supplement, artistic portfolios, etc.   Interviews   NYU occasionally invites candidates to interview with us via Skype or similar video technology, but we do not offer on-campus interviews for any of our applicants. If you are invited to interview with us, we will contact you directly.   Applicants who are competitive for admission to NYU Abu Dhabi and/or NYU Shanghai may be invited to participate in our Candidate Weekends/Days. During the programs, prospective students are invited to visit campus and meet with current students, faculty, and administrators.   Applicants cannot request an interview or an invitation to a Candidate Weekend/Day.   Application Review   If anything is missing from your application file, we will offer you a limited window in which to provide the outstanding information.   Once your application is complete, it will be thoroughly reviewed by our admissions committee. We have no set formulas that we follow when we review applications, because we actively seek a mix of students who have a variety of interests, talents, and goals. If you are applying for admission to a program that requires an artistic review by our faculty, the results of that review will also be evaluated before an admissions decision is rendered.   Admissions officers personally review every application we receive\u2014there are no cutoffs for admission, and every applicant is considered holistically.

You should not apply as a transfer if you are enrolled in an associate's degree program while pursuing your high school diploma. You also should not apply as a transfer if you are seeking a second Bachelor's degree in Nursing or a second Bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering .     Our most competitive applicants will have completed at least 32 credits/points of liberal arts coursework by the time you would enroll at NYU (equivalent to approximately one year of full-time study). Credits/points obtained through a certificate program or a vocational training program will not likely transfer to NYU.   Transfer applicants who have already completed at least one year of full-time college or university enrollment in liberal arts and science courses are exempt from having to submit standardized test results to NYU.     You should apply as a first-year freshman applicant if you: have taken college or university courses as a non-degree student after or while enrolled in high school; or have been enrolled in a non-degree conservatory or vocational training program.     The Office of Undergraduate Admissions serves only full-time, degree-seeking candidates for admission. If you are a returning adult student, looking to complete your degree part-time, or simply looking to take NYU courses on a non-degree basis, contact NYU's School of Professional Studies .              Important Notes     Transfer admission for students currently in their first full-time semester of college work is highly competitive. Because in-progress coursework is unlikely to be sufficient enough to evaluate a transfer application, the focus of the evaluation will be primarily based on one's high/secondary school performance, though mid-term college/university grades will be expected.   Spring transfer admission is not available in either the Stern School of Business, specific programs in the Tisch School of the Arts, or specific programs in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. (For example: the Music Theory and Composition program does not offer spring admission to external transfer candidates from outside NYU while the Media, Culture, and Communications, as well as Music Business programs do not offer any spring admission to either internal or external candidates).     New transfers entering the Film and Television program in the Tisch School of the Arts are required to begin their studies in one of the two NYU summer sessions.   Housing for transfer students is limited and not guaranteed. Admitted transfer students will be expected to respond to their offer of admission before a housing placement is offered.   Though our deadline for Spring transfer admission is November 1 and our deadline for Summer/Fall transfer admission is April 1, we suggest that you submit your Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review in the Tisch School of the Arts or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Submitting your Common Application early will leave you more time to prepare your artistic review credentials (such as your portfolio) and if applicable, schedule an audition by our deadlines above. Be sure to consult our additional program requirements for more information.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

If you must submit a check or money order instead, include your name, Common Application and/or NYU University ID number on your check or money order. Please make your check or money order payable to New York University and send to:   New York University  Office of Undergraduate Admissions  665 Broadway, Suite 1100  New York, NY 10012-2339   Receiving a receipt for the payment of your fee does not mean that your Common Application has been submitted. You must check your submission status on the Common Application website to ensure that both your Common Application and required NYU Supplement have been submitted to be eligible for admission.   Our application fee should not discourage any student from applying to NYU. Students who feel that the application fee would be a financial hardship for their families can simply request a fee waiver on the Common Application. Your counselor or school official will be asked to verify your eligibility so alert your counselor in advance to the fact that you have requested a waiver.                             Students applying for a second bachelor's in Nursing:   You may pay your $70 application fee online within the application for the Second Bachelor's in Nursing. You will be prompted to pay the fee right before you submit your application. (It is not possible to pay by check or money order for this particular application fee.)
