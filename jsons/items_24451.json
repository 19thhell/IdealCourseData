Note: If you are accepted as a transfer student there are two factors that determine how long it will take you to complete your degree at NYU. These factors are 1) the number of completed credits that NYU will accept and apply to your curriculum requirements and 2) the number of semesters of private lessons the faculty adjudicators decide you must take in order to complete your NYU degree. Completed semesters of private lessons at another institution will not necessarily count toward your degree requirements at NYU. Be aware that while the private study requirement can be provided to you immediately upon your acceptance, it often takes longer for the University and the Program to process and apply your transfer credits.
