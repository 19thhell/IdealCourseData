Since graduation, Forest has worked in the fast-paced world of software development in Silicon Valley for the networking giant Cisco Systems, Inc. while spending his free time entering short film competitions in the San Francisco Bay Area and fostering his love for film production. It was from this experience that he decided to enter the graduate program at NYU.      Through the dual-degree program, he strives to understand the business of film, with the ambition of becoming an independent film producer. With the world class professors and the access to some of the nation's greatest filmmaking talent, he believes that the opportunities are limitless.      Forest was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina.             Colin Whitlow   Colin Whitlow currently lives and works in Brooklyn and originally hails from rural Virginia. He attended the University of Virginia where he majored in Studio Art and English. Following college Colin worked at YouTube as a Senior Strategist developing help\u00a0initiatives for social media platforms. He's looking forward to engaging his passions for film and novel technologies to explore systems for film distribution and marketing that break traditional boundaries.   Colin has worked on a diverse set of creative projects. Intrigued by a fight club made up of self-declared tech geeks, Colin oversaw and produced documentary footage of the \"Gentleman's Fight Club\" (GFC) which appeared on ESPN and National Geographic among other outlets. Apparently, the first rule of GFC is tell everyone about it. He also worked as a crew member for 2 summers at the Sundance Director's Lab, an experience that exposed him to industry professionals who engage in unique processes for creative discovery. Colin pioneered a slate of official YouTube videos which the company used to show the world how to do everything from uploading videos to creating a global audience. While usually behind the camera, he appears in a recent YouTube-sponsored video in the \"buff\" -- no, he won't tell you which one.\u00a0During an Aunspaugh Fellowship he wrote, produced, shot and edited a photographic novel entitled Lavender and Other Colors. Please ask him for your complimentary copy.\u00a0In his spare time he helps out on friends' commercials and shorts. He sometimes has a beard.        GEOFF MANSFIELD   Geoff grew up in Hong Kong, where his family still lives. His father is from Colorado, his mother Cuban, and he went to the German school which made sense at the time. A graduate of Tufts University, Geoff worked in film and TV production in New York and then as an editor and copywriter before getting both his MFA and MBA at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and Stern School of Business. There he produced several short films and a TV pilot and was selected as both the Bernie Brillstein Scholar and co-recipient of the Wayfare Film Finance Research Grant. Somewhere along the way he rode a bicycle across the States, which is a really nice way to see the place         Shruti Ganguly   On the program   I think that the program is one of the best decisions I've ever made - From having the opportunity to take various business and film classes to connecting and working with my fellow Dualers and classmates. You are provided with the best of both worlds - a world class business education coupled with a premiere film school. It is also exciting to be a part of a new initiative and help mold it into something special and unique. The access to the professors and career opportunities is unrivaled.   Bio    Shruti is a recent graduate of NYU's dual MBA and MFA program. At Stern, she specialized in Entertainment, Media & Technology as well as Social Innovation and Impact and was the recipient of the business school's most prestigious award, the Kenshin Oshima Scholarship. While at Tisch, Shruti concentrated in producing and film financing but also directed short film and branded content.      Over the past year, Shruti teamed up with James Franco and his production company Rabbit Bandini to craft and produce two feature films that were developed in the 3rd-year directing program - Tar, a biopic on the poet C.K. Williams, starring James Franco, Mila Kunis, Jessica Chastain, Zach Braff and Henry Hopper, and Black Dog, Red Dog, with Logan Marshall-Green, Chloe Sevigny, Olivia Wilde, Whoopi Goldberg and James Franco. Shruti continues to work with Franco on feature as well as short form content.       During school, Shruti interned at Ted Hope's Double Hope Films and IMAX and as a Wayfare Fellow, she conducted a yearlong research project of choice, which centered on the future of independent film and branding. Prior to NYU, she ran NYLON TV, the online channel of NYLON Magazine, where she produced over 200 videos and headed up its strategy to be developed into its own sustainable media entity.       Shruti was featured in Keanu Reeves' recent documentary, Side by Side, which stars film greats like Martin Scorcese, George Lucas, David Fincher, Christopher Nolan and Danny Boyle, and is a commentary on how digital technology has impacted the film business.       Shruti got her Bachelor's degree from Northwestern University, where she double majored in Communications Studies and Fine Arts, with a Business Minor. She hails from Muscat, Oman by way of India.            Matt Reeve   After college I was working as an independent producer and director making documentaries, music videos, and online fashion content. Film was always my first love though, and when it came time to make the transition, I knew I needed to go to graduate film school. Aware of the importance of strong business skills in the creative industries, when I learned of the dual MBA/MFA program at NYU I knew it would provide me with a unique and essential platform to help me achieve my goal.        Itir Sezik   Itir Sezik was born in Ankara, Turkey. She got her BSc. Business Administration degree from Bilkent University in 2005 and began working in Ernst & Young Istanbul office as an auditor. In 2007, she joined Ernst & Young\u2019s Corporate Finance department as a senior associate and worked until 2009. At the meantime, she participated in IFSAK\u2019s (Istanbul Photography and Film Amateurs Association) short filmmaking workshop and Tevfik Baser\u2019s script writing workshop. She produced, wrote, directed and edited 5 short films (High Heels (Oct 2008), A Little Love Story (Jan 2007), Random Shots (Aug 2006), Vacation (Jun 2006) and Istanbul (Oct 2005)).   Itir is discovering various different opportunities in her new career path. She firmly believes that the MBA/MFA dual degree program will help her leverage her strong background in finance and accounting, with her talent and passion for filmmaking. Since she began the program, Itir has attended Cannes Film Festival as a part of the Craft and Commerce of Cinema course. In addition, she has produced a commercial (\u201cNuts for NY\u201d) for Promotion Pictures competition at Stern with her fellow dual degree students. She also shot (in 16 mm film), directed, and edited 5 more short films in the Sight and Sound class at Tisch.        Jacob Robinson   Jacob runs Brooklyn Abridged Films, a New York-based production company and filmmakers collective founded in 2005. He began his film career producing The Distance Between the Apple and the Tree, a low-budget feature filmed in Cambodia and the U.S. Following his new love of producing, Jacob continued to make films across a wide variety of subject matter -- notably, Alice Jacobs is Dead, a zombie love-story starring Adrienne Barbeau. Since enrolling at NYU, he has produced another dozen short films as well as several advertisements, industrials, and branded content spots. Most recently, Jacob spent five weeks in Thailand with a classmate producing \"Each Moment is the Universe\", a short film commissioned by the Thai government as part of Film Expo Asia -- the film won the Toyota Expo Award for first runner-up.   Following graduation, Jacob hopes to produce the feature concepts he has developed while at NYU as well as those of his talented peers.   Prior to making films, Jacob worked for several years in management consulting, focusing primarily on strategy and marketing for financial services firms. He holds a BA in Government and Theater from Wesleyan University.
