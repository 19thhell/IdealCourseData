Plagiarism Advisory   Research ProjectFormat History : In this project, each student will choose one film or one video format or format variant to research.  Students should create an annotated bibliography and a detailed description/history that must include:    time period for the format   physical/chemical makeup and properties       (oxide used, track configuration, physical dimensions, housing, sprocket size and configuration,     varieties of emulsion composition and characteristics, etc., as appropriate to the format/media)     associated playback devices   competing formats   main user groups and use environments   well known content associated with the format    formats that preceeded and followed   what, if any, technological capabilities were introduced on entry of the format into the market?   what, if any, technological capabilities lead to the format's demise in the market?     The bibliography should cover the whole format, but the paper, beyond the elements above, should focus on one aspect or variation of the format.

Plagiarism Advisory   Research ProjectFormat History : In this project, each student will choose one film or one video format or format variant to research.  Students should create an annotated bibliography and a detailed description/history that must include:    time period for the format   physical/chemical makeup and properties       (oxide used, track configuration, physical dimensions, housing, sprocket size and configuration,     varieties of emulsion composition and characteristics, etc., as appropriate to the format/media)     associated playback devices   competing formats   main user groups and use environments   well known content associated with the format    formats that preceeded and followed   what, if any, technological capabilities were introduced on entry of the format into the market?   what, if any, technological capabilities lead to the format's demise in the market?     The bibliography should cover the whole format, but the paper, beyond the elements above, should focus on one aspect or variation of the format.
