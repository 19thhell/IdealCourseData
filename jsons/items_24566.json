Students&rsquo; clinical experiences are used as a basis to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of intervention.    OT-GE 2335 Successful Intervention in Schools (3). This course examines therapist&rsquo;s perceptions that have an impact on therapy in the classroom. Students will learn to identify strategies and methods that will assist in designing intervention plans that can be implemented in a classroom. Students will research effective strategies for ensuring best practice in a wide variety of educational systems.    OT-GE 2338 Reframing the Meaning of Disability to Families (3). This course examines family centered care for families with special needs; reviews theoretical approaches and explores the views and experiences of parents and other care providers; evaluates the importance of the environment to clinical decision making and service delivery.    OT-GE 2341 Clinical Management I: Bone and Joint Disorders of the Upper Quadrant (3). This course will use a seminar and laboratory teaching model to explore the intervention processes for hand and upper limb bone and joint disorders. This course will address the psychological and physical ramifications of hand and upper limb impairments.    OT-GE 2342 Clinical Management II: Nerve Disorders of the Upper Quadrant (3). This course will use a seminar, laboratory, and workshop model to explore the intervention processes for hand and upper limb nerve disorders that are traumatic or chronic in nature. This course will address nerve injuries in continuity that frequently present as cumulative trauma disorders and may be mistaken for tendonitis. The course will emphasize how to distinguish between tendon and nerve involvement and the subsequent appropriate intervention strategies.    OT-GE 2343 Clinical Management III: Complex, Multi-System Injuries of the Upper Quadrant (3). This course will use lecture, seminar, and laboratory teaching model to explore intervention strategies for the complex, multi-system and/or catastrophic upper limb injuries. As the final course sequence of three treatment courses, it will also address working with the &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; patient and the ways in which the practicing therapist can promote recovery from a physical and psychological perspective.    OT-GE 2762 Theoretical Foundations for Intervention (3). How theoretical information is formulated, refined, tested, and assessed relative to its suitability for use in sets of guidelines for occupational therapy practice.    OT-GE 2764 Ethics and Analytic Reasoning (3). Analysis of philosophical issues in therapy with an emphasis on considering ethical dilemmas and sound arguments. Characteristics of analytic philosophy and techniques are explored.    OT-GE 2801 Anatomy and Biomechanics of the Upper Quadrant (3). In-depth human anatomy dissection of the upper quadrant, including cervical and thoracic spine, scapula, shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand. Principles of biomechanics, joint structure and muscle function, emphasizing analysis of movement of the upper quadrant. Relationship of anatomical structure and function to injury or illness of the upper quadrant will be addressed.    OT-GE 2900 Contemporary Issues in Occupational Therapy: Developing Assistive Technology (3). This multi-disciplinary course allows students from a variety of backgrounds to work together to develop examples of assistive technology. Partnering with outside organizations, students will work in teams to identify a clinical need relevant to a certain clinical site or client population, and learn the process of developing an idea and following that through to the development of a prototype product. The major learning activity is the design and fabrication of a device (piece of equipment, software, etc.) that meets a specific need for a specific person with a disability or a clinic that treats clients with disabilities or a category of people with similar needs as a result of their disability.    OT-GE 3301 Evidence-based Practice (3). Students will evaluate clinical literature and determine the evidence level of a clinical study, appraise the feasibility or application in everyday practice, and design a program evaluation of their own practice using evidence-based approach. The course will emphasize the need for evidence based occupational therapy practice.    OT-GE 3306 Advanced Assessments for the Practicing Therapist (3). The course focuses on the selection and use of an evidence-based evaluation system to measure practice outcomes and interpret clinical change. This process requires selecting the tools for assessment of function based on achieved validity and to accurately interpret observations and measurements.    OT-GE 3310 Professional Portfolio: Advanced Practice (3). Students will assess and refine their portfolios. Portfolios will be web-based and include performance observations, case students, peer ratings, specialty certification documentation of professional activities, publications, and presentation summaries. At the end of the semester, students will present their portfolio to a panel of three faculty members. The portfolio will document how the student integrated knowledge and skills learned in the curriculum to his or her specialty practice area.    Electives (9)   Students are required to complete nine points of electives in related fields to support their studies. In addition to departmental selections, students may select electives from university-wide offerings.

Electives (9)   Students are required to complete nine points of electives in related fields to support their studies. In addition to departmental selections, students may select electives from university-wide offerings. Departmental electives may include:             Catalog# Course Nam e             OT-GE 2201          Intervention for Families and Children in their Natural Environments                OT-GE 2202          Evidence-Based Practice for Children and their Families                OT-GE 2204          Application of Occupational Therapy to Clinical, Educational, and Family-Centered Services                OT-GE 2763          Developing a Guideline for Intervention                                 This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;       by New York University.

The fundamental structures that support our urban infrastructure -- such as transportation, energy, water, energy, communications and waste -- are aging and the likelihood of failures is at an alarming level. As urban populations continue to grow, these complex, multi-layered systems will be further stressed. NYU School of Engineering faculty work across engineering and science disciplines along with public policy, finance, management, medicine and legal experts, to identify and deliver the next wave of technological and operational solutions targeted to urban communities ranging from designing smarter power grids to engineering sustainable building materials capable of withstanding natural disaster or manmade hazards. Of particular interest is research into IT and data-driven aspects of urban systems and smart cities.        Urban Science, Engineering and Technology at NYU School of Engineering is part of NYU\u2019s university-wide initiative on \u201cThe Future of Cities,\u201d called the Institute for Cities and Environmental Sustainability (ICES), which encompasses city planning, design, and development; the social sciences of cities; legal issues of cities; health in cities; the ecology of cities; urbanization and the coastal zone; and very broadly urban engineering (which includes, among others, cyber-physical systems such as sensors, sensor systems, and actuators; cyber-communication and control systems; smart grid and integration of renewable energy). Urban Science, Engineering, and Technology at NYU School of Engineering also provides the foundation for the center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), a NYU-led consortium of university partners, industrial partners, and several NYC agencies.
