Though a complete business plan and team is not required for consideration, the technology underpinning the venture concept should have achieved the proof-of- concept or prototype stage and solve a measurable problem in a large and growing market. The founders should be the nucleus around which a strong, entrepreneurial team can form and execute a financially attractive business plan.

The work should strengthen the scientific evidence base applied to the following key global public health areas:   \u2022Addiction  \u2022 Environmental health  \u2022 Global mental health  \u2022 Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)  \u2022 Public health policy, and  \u2022 Reproductive/sexual health including HIV   The award seeks to encourage global partnerships that will provide a foundation to address important research questions within these global settings and that will potentially lead to the development of funding from external sources. Program and processes can include but are not limited to: intervention, screening, training, data analysis etc. for a targeted population, or convening of scientific meeting(s) on a key topic that results in a defined deliverable such as a larger grant submission, white paper, methodological advancement or other scholarly product.   A collaborative approach to the process is integral. The assumption is that the research cannot be implemented without participation by both the principal investigator (PI) researcher and GNU partner(s). Each proposal must include a letter from the GNU site\u2019s signatory authority outlining its participation and an agreement that the PI controls the data and dissemination.   Criteria for evaluation  \u2022 The extent to which the proposed work is clearly focused on one of the seven global public health priority areas listed above  \u2022 The extent to which the results will contribute to advancing global collaborations and partnerships in NYU\u2019s GNU network  \u2022 Agreement by the proposed GNU partner to participate in the work being proposed (letter of support and collaboration from the GNU site must be included)  \u2022 Clear delineation of the role of the PI and GNU partner(s) in conducting the work  \u2022 Significance and potential for advancing the field of study and enhancing the translation of theory to practice  \u2022 Innovation in approach, methods and concept  \u2022 Well-specified research problem  \u2022 Feasibility of the conceptual framework, plan and methodology  \u2022 Experience and potential of the project investigator to conduct the proposed research  \u2022 Dissemination plans   Eligibility and Restrictions  \u2022 All GIPH faculty (full, joint, clinical, affiliated, associated) members and GIPH Affinity Group Members are eligible to apply  \u2022 Applications must include a partnership with one of the NYU GNU partner sites  \u2022 Investigators may not have received GIPH Global Challenge funding in the past 2 years  \u2022 If funded the GNU site(s) may receive funds directly from the Award in accordance with New York University\u2019s Controllers Division Business Expenses Policy 1.3.  \u2022 Money cannot be used for faculty salaries  \u2022 Awards may not exceed 12 months without prior approval   Budget Guidance and Restrictions:  \u2022 GIPH intends to fund an estimate of 1-2 awards within each affinity group, corresponding to a total of $30,000 for each group.  \u2022 All necessary costs must be listed in the budget template provided. Funds may not support faculty effort. Although not limited to, costs may include: IRB costs, research supplies, travel, hourly student time, participant payments, consultant costs, meeting costs, and honorariums.  Please note that if there are human subjects included in the proposal, we cannot award funding until NYU has granted human subject approval. GIPH Grants Manager must receive a copy of the UCAIHS approval before the release of funds. Information about Human Subjects can be seen at http://www.nyu.edu/ucaihs.   REPORTING:  All investigators must provide a one-page progress report to the GIPH Office of Research within 60 days after the completion of the funding cycle. We may ask recipients of Awards to present findings at a GIPH research forum.
