With case-based teaching, students develop skills in analytical thinking by reading and discussing complex, real-life scenarios.    Pioneered in the early 20th Century at Harvard University, the case method has become a teaching method in most of the world's leading business schools. A process of discussion and analysis, guided by a skilled case teacher, leads class participants to deeper insights into management and business issues and their resolution. Faculty and students familiar with the case method universally regard it as the most effective and enjoyable way to learn.
