Drawing on the literature examining democracy and health, we argue that more democratic regimes \u2013 where citizens have positive opinions on democracy and where competitive, free and fair elections put pressure on incumbents \u2013 will choose health policies targeting a broader proportion of the population. We compare Ghana to Kenya and Senegal, two other countries which have also undergone democratization, but where there have been important differences in the extent to which these democratic changes have been perceived by regular citizens and have translated into electoral competition. We find that Ghana has adopted the most ambitious health reform strategy by designing and implementing the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). We also find that Ghana experienced greater improvements in skilled attendance at birth, childhood immunizations, and improvements in the proportion of children with diarrhea treated by oral rehydration therapy than the other countries since this policy was adopted. These changes also appear to be associated with important changes in health outcomes: both infant and under-five mortality rates declined rapidly since the introduction of the NHIS in Ghana. These improvements in health and health service delivery have also been observed by citizens with a greater proportion of Ghanaians reporting satisfaction with government handling of health service delivery relative to either Kenya or Senegal. We argue that the democratization process can promote the adoption of particular health policies and that this is an important mechanism through which democracy can improve health.

GIPH is invested in producing research of the highest caliber and houses a global public health research center, serving as a University-wide resource for large scale, multi-school, multi-disciplinary and multi-site research projects. GIPH research draws from faculty expertise on multiple topics in multiple geographic settings; coordinates administrative support; works collaboratively with community partners and constituents; and takes a comprehensive approach to research problems, incorporating complimentary perspectives and approaches from across disciplines.            Research Profile: NYU/Ghana Health Partnership                                   New York University and its affiliated public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center , and the University of Ghana and its affiliated public hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital , have developed a multi-disciplinary collaboration for health professional development that will result in sustained and significant improvements in health and health care in Ghana and the United States. More recently, this NYU/Ghana Health partnership has expanded to include the new University of Health &amp; Allied Sciences (Volta) as well as the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service.           A variety of projects are underway, involving faculty from several of NYU's schools (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Steinhardt, Wagner). The partnership addresses a variety of topics, including but not limited to:     increasing the midlevel provider workforce in sub-saharan Africa   improving access to qualified health providers   improving health outcomes (including nutrition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, oral health)     creating cost effectivenss to lower the financial burden on national financing systems   stengthening emergency medicine systems and services in Ghana            Research Highlights          Faculty who participate in the Global Institute of Public Health engage in a diverse and impressive array of research across the university.

Gr\u00e9pin, Karen and Kim Yi Dionne          09/23/2013               This article identifies conditions under which newly established democracies adopt Universal Health Coverage. Drawing on the literature examining democracy and health, we argue that more democratic regimes \u2013 where citizens have positive opinions on democracy and where competitive, free and fair elections put pressure on incumbents \u2013 will choose health policies targeting a broader proportion of the population. We compare Ghana to Kenya and Senegal, two other countries which have also undergone democratization, but where there have been important differences in the extent to which these democratic changes have been perceived by regular citizens and have translated into electoral competition. We find that Ghana has adopted the most ambitious health reform strategy by designing and implementing the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). We also find that Ghana experienced greater improvements in skilled attendance at birth, childhood immunizations, and improvements in the proportion of children with diarrhea treated by oral rehydration therapy than the other countries since this policy was adopted. These changes also appear to be associated with important changes in health outcomes: both infant and under-five mortality rates declined rapidly since the introduction of the NHIS in Ghana. These improvements in health and health service delivery have also been observed by citizens with a greater proportion of Ghanaians reporting satisfaction with government handling of health service delivery relative to either Kenya or Senegal. We argue that the democratization process can promote the adoption of particular health policies and that this is an important mechanism through which democracy can improve health.

GIPH is invested in producing research of the highest caliber and houses a global public health research center, serving as a University-wide resource for large scale, multi-school, multi-disciplinary and multi-site research projects. GIPH research draws from faculty expertise on multiple topics in multiple geographic settings; coordinates administrative support; works collaboratively with community partners and constituents; and takes a comprehensive approach to research problems, incorporating complimentary perspectives and approaches from across disciplines.            Research Profile: NYU/Ghana Health Partnership                                   New York University and its affiliated public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center , and the University of Ghana and its affiliated public hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital , have developed a multi-disciplinary collaboration for health professional development that will result in sustained and significant improvements in health and health care in Ghana and the United States. More recently, this NYU/Ghana Health partnership has expanded to include the new University of Health &amp; Allied Sciences (Volta) as well as the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service.           A variety of projects are underway, involving faculty from several of NYU's schools (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Steinhardt, Wagner). The partnership addresses a variety of topics, including but not limited to:     increasing the midlevel provider workforce in sub-saharan Africa   improving access to qualified health providers   improving health outcomes (including nutrition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, oral health)     creating cost effectivenss to lower the financial burden on national financing systems   stengthening emergency medicine systems and services in Ghana            Research Highlights          Faculty who participate in the Global Institute of Public Health engage in a diverse and impressive array of research across the university.

Rodwin and Kam Che Chan          01/01/2013               We investigate avoidable hospital conditions (AHC) in three world cities as a way to assess access to primary care. Residents of Hong Kong are healthier than their counterparts in Greater London or New York City. In contrast to their counterparts in New York City, residents of both Greater London and Hong Kong face no financial barriers to an extensive public hospital system. We compare residence-based hospital discharge rates for AHC, by age cohorts, in these cities and find that New York City has higher rates than Hong Kong and Greater London. Hong Kong has the lowest hospital discharge rates for AHC among the population 15\u201364, but its rates are nearly as high as those in New York City among the population 65 and over. Our findings suggest that in contrast to Greater London, older residents in Hong Kong and New York face significant barriers in accessing primary care. In all three cities, people living in lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods are more likely to be hospitalized for an AHC, but neighborhood inequalities are greater in Hong Kong and New York than in Greater London.
