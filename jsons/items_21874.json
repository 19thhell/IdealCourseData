The Center for Labor and Employment Law provides a nonpartisan forum to debate and study the policy and legal issues around the employment relationship.         Overview   Business productivity and worker quality of life are both shaped by developments in labor and employment law. NYU Law is unusual among the very top law schools in the size and quality of its full-time faculty in this field.   The Big Picture   Labor and employment lawyers work on complex legal matters that profoundly and directly affect the lives of real people. Disputes between employees and employers are pervasive in our society and collectively represent more than 20 percent of the caseload of the federal and state courts. These disputes touch on all elements of the employment relationship, involving workers as individuals, as members of protected groups (e.g., race, gender, age, disability), and as participants in collective action (e.g., unionization and collective bargaining). They arise under local, state, federal, and international laws that utilize the full range of legal rules and regulatory tools. With globalization, American lawyers also increasingly deal with treaties and other sources of international law as well as foreign nations\u2019 labor and employment laws. Our rich course offerings cover the full range of issues comprising the practice and study of labor and employment law.   Labor and employment lawyers work across a wide range of practice modalities, such as litigation, negotiation (including collective bargaining), compliance, alternative dispute resolution, policy-making, community organizing, and business planning. They practice in law firms of all sizes; in-house at corporations and labor unions; in civil-rights and other public interest organizations; at all levels of government; and as arbitrators and mediators.

The 2015 Conference explores the central issues of labor and employment law \u2013 Who is an employee? and Who is the employer? The NLRB General Counsel\u2019s complaints against McDonald\u2019s raise the question of when are firms \u201cjoint employers\u201d of the same group of workers, which also arises under the civil rights law. Other cutting-edge issues include: When can companies classify service providers as independent contractors? In view of the Northwestern Univ . case, when must student athletes be treated as employees? When must owners like partners be classified as employees? Can individuals work without pay as interns or volunteers? What new forms of worker organization are cropping up? What is the \u201craise the minimum wage\u201d campaign about? How are these issues treated abroad?   For the complete agenda and to register, please go to http://bit.ly/68thlaborconference .   This event is seeking approval for New York State CLE credit.

The Center for Labor and Employment Law provides a nonpartisan forum to debate and study the policy and legal issues around the employment relationship.         Overview   Business productivity and worker quality of life are both shaped by developments in labor and employment law. NYU Law is unusual among the very top law schools in the size and quality of its full-time faculty in this field.   The Big Picture   Labor and employment lawyers work on complex legal matters that profoundly and directly affect the lives of real people. Disputes between employees and employers are pervasive in our society and collectively represent more than 20 percent of the caseload of the federal and state courts. These disputes touch on all elements of the employment relationship, involving workers as individuals, as members of protected groups (e.g., race, gender, age, disability), and as participants in collective action (e.g., unionization and collective bargaining). They arise under local, state, federal, and international laws that utilize the full range of legal rules and regulatory tools. With globalization, American lawyers also increasingly deal with treaties and other sources of international law as well as foreign nations\u2019 labor and employment laws. Our rich course offerings cover the full range of issues comprising the practice and study of labor and employment law.   Labor and employment lawyers work across a wide range of practice modalities, such as litigation, negotiation (including collective bargaining), compliance, alternative dispute resolution, policy-making, community organizing, and business planning. They practice in law firms of all sizes; in-house at corporations and labor unions; in civil-rights and other public interest organizations; at all levels of government; and as arbitrators and mediators.
