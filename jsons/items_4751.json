Generally, subject headings for books in history follow a specific pattern:   Place name -- Subdivision -- Time period .      Place names can be names of countries, regions or cities.  Subdivisions , as listed below in the examples, are standard and can be used with various place names. They describe the particular emphasis of the book.  Time period refers to the years covered by the book; time period designations vary according to place.     The following examples illustrate possible subject searches for the history of 19-century Great Britain:                Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period              s = Great Britain          History --     History --     Intellectual life --     Social conditions --     Economic conditions --     Politics and government --     Foreign relations --              19th century     Victoria, 1837-1901     19th century     19th century     1760-1860     19th century     1800-1837                 You can find information on all Western European countries by following this general pattern.     Also find information on interdisciplinary subjects with the alternate pattern:                Subject      Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period                  s = Women --     s = Middle classes --              France --     England --              History --     History --              19th century     19th century                 For more information, consult the Library of Congress Subject Headings , a 4-volume set which contains the subject headings used in BobCat and other library catalogs. Look under the place name or subject to see the appropriate subdivisions and time periods. Copies of LCSH are in all reference centers.

Generally, subject headings for books in history follow a specific pattern:   Place name -- Subdivision -- Time period .      Place names can be names of countries, regions or cities.  Subdivisions , as listed below in the examples, are standard and can be used with various place names. They describe the particular emphasis of the book.  Time period refers to the years covered by the book; time period designations vary according to place.     The following examples illustrate possible subject searches for the history of 19-century Great Britain:                Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period              s = Great Britain          History --     History --     Intellectual life --     Social conditions --     Economic conditions --     Politics and government --     Foreign relations --              19th century     Victoria, 1837-1901     19th century     19th century     1760-1860     19th century     1800-1837                 You can find information on all Western European countries by following this general pattern.     Also find information on interdisciplinary subjects with the alternate pattern:                Subject      Place Name      Subdivision      Time Period                  s = Women --     s = Middle classes --              France --     England --              History --     History --              19th century     19th century                 For more information, consult the Library of Congress Subject Headings , a 4-volume set which contains the subject headings used in BobCat and other library catalogs. Look under the place name or subject to see the appropriate subdivisions and time periods. Copies of LCSH are in all reference centers.

Advanced Courses   European History Lectures      The Early Middle Ages   HIST-UA 111 Identical  to MEDI-UA 111. Offered every other year. Bedos-Rezak. 4 points.   Europe in the early  Middle Ages was created out of a mixture of ingredients: the legacy  of the Roman Empire; the growth and development of Christianity;  invading peoples who settled within the boundaries of the former  Roman Empire; and the clash of competing languages, religions, and  legal systems.

During this  period, Britain emerged as the world\u2019s first industrial nation and  a primary imperial power, fought two world wars partly in an effort  to maintain that position, and unevenly accommodated the changed  realities of the late 20th century.

Examines the political,  social, and cultural history of liberalism, fascism, World War II,  Christian Democracy, and communism; the political crisis of the early  1990s; and the rise of new regional and rightist parties.      Italian Films, Italian  Histories II   HIST-UA 176 Identical  to DRLIT-UA 506, ITAL-UA 175. May be taken independently of Italian  Films, Italian Histories I (ITAL-UA 174). Offered every two to three  years. Ben-Ghiat. 4 points.   Studies representations  of Italian history through the medium of film from the unification of  Italy to the present.

Lecture course focusing  on the cultural, political, and religious history of Poland from the  Middle Ages to the present. Begins with the foundation of the Polish  state in the 10th century, discusses the early modern  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and then considers the modern history  of Poland, including the period of the partitions in the 18th  century, the evolution of modern nationalism in the 19th century, and  the experiences of war and communism in the 20th century.      Race, Religion, and  Gender in 20th-Century France   HIST-UA 192 Offered  every year. Chapman. 4 points.   Explores how people in  France grappled with questions of race, religion, and gender during  the 20th century. It begins with the Dreyfus Affair, a national  convulsion over anti-Semitism and a miscarriage of justice that  influenced debates over prejudice in France for decades thereafter.  It then turns to the experiences of women and men during the First  World War, including soldiers and workers recruited from the  colonies. After examining the dynamics of discrimination against  Jews, colonial subjects, and women during World War II, the course  concludes with the French-Algerian war (1954\u201362), when issues of  race, religion, and gender surfaced with explosive force in  metropolitan France, as well as in Algeria.      Liberal Visions of  Empire   HIST-UA 195 Offered  every other year. Sartori. 4 points.   A lecture course  exploring the changing relationship between British liberal thought  and Britain\u2019s expanding empire from the 17th to the 20th centuries.  Liberal conceptions of equality and freedom are generally understood  to be fundamentally anti-imperialistic in impulse, as historically  complicit with imperialist agendas, and as inherently and logically  disposed to imperialist domination. The course attempts to put these  different claims into historical context and to periodize their  applicability.      Women in European  Society Since 1750   HIST-UA 196 Identical  to SCA-UA 716. Offered every other year. Nolan. 4 points.   Examines critically the  public and private lives of European women from 1750 to the present.  An introduction discusses the theory and methods of using gender as a  category in history and proceeds to a chronological survey of women\u2019s  experience from both a social and a political viewpoint. Women are  examined as participants in war and revolution, as well as workers,  consumers, and mothers in everyday life. The focus is primarily on  France, Germany, and England, with some reference to women\u2019s  experience in America.      Gendering the Middle  Ages   HIST-UA 197 Offered  every fourth year. Bedos-Rezak. 4 points.   Takes up questions  about the identity and agency of women and about the performative  nature of gender in Western culture and society during the Middle  Ages.

Colloquium: 20th Century European Capitalism HIST-UA 272 Offered every other year. 4 points. Nineteenth   century Europe was the birthplace of economic liberalism. The gold   standard, the night watchman state, and the writings of the classical   economists laid the foundation for a golden age of laissez-faire   capitalism. More than a century later we see Europe as the birthplace of   the modern welfare state, a pioneer of organized capitalism, and the   center for a supra-national experiment in economic cooperation: the   European Union. This course traces the evolution of European capitalism   during the twentieth century, from a laissez-faire to a social market   economy. Throughout the semester we will study key themes and turning   points that shaped Europe's economic development: the Great Depression;   the World Wars; alternative ways of organizing an economic life under   fascism and communism; the stagnation of the 1970s; and European   economic integration.

Colloquium: Pirates and Buccaneers: Seaborne Terrorism in the Early Modern World HIST-UA 369 Offered every year. 4 points. This course will sort out the myths and realities of the \u201cGolden Age of Piracy.\u201d The emergence of Spain as a political and economic superpower in the early sixteenth century bred waves of French, English, and Dutch interlopers, contraband slave traders, seaborne raiders, freebooters, and privateers eager to thwart her attempt at hegemony and expropriate her wealth. Their success gave rise to a multinational and cross-cultural underworld of violence and crime on the high seas that flourished nearly unchecked from the mid-seventeenth century until its suppression in the early decades of the eighteenth century. The response of the early modern world to piracy and buccaneering is embedded in the \u201cLaw of Nations\u201d and the \u201cLaw of the Sea,\u201d progenitors of modern international law. Participants in this course will engage a rich body of primary and secondary historical sources to reconstruct and interpret the multiple contexts within which piracy and buccaneering operated.      Seminar: Topics in  Medieval History   HIST-UA 441   Bedos-Rezak, Griffiths. 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.

Seminar: Britain since  World War II   HIST-UA 451 Open to  history majors who have completed Historical Studies: Theories and  Practice (HIST-UA 101), or by permission of the instructor. Ortolano.  4 points.   Assists students in  writing archivally-based research papers about a single topic in  recent British history. Since the end of the Second World War,  Britain has faced many of the challenges typical of Western  societies, as well as more particular obstacles resulting from its  status as a recent imperial power. British history since 1945 has  thus been characterized by the creation of the welfare state, the end  of the British Empire, immigration and racial conflict, \u201cSwinging  London\u201d and 1960s second-wave feminism, labor unrest and the  decline of heavy industry, neo-liberal economics, and Tony Blair\u2019s  New Labour. We spend the first part of the seminar becoming  acquainted with these developments, while also identifying specific  topics for students to explore through primary-source-based papers of  about 20 pages.      United States History Seminar: Topics in U.S.  History      HIST-UA 413 4 points.   Topics vary from  semester to semester.

Course readings will move between regions and through time as we explore themes including environment, geography, economics, politics, and culture. While class discussions will focus on a series of secondary readings, students are encouraged to draw on a wide range of materials, ranging from music, films, and physical objects to political reports and historical monographs, in writing a research paper that will explore some aspect of regional history in the United States.    Seminar: Capital and Labor and the Making of Modern America   HIST-UA 416 Offered  every other year. Montoya. 4 points.   This course has two  purposes. The first is to learn the fundamentals of historical  research. By completing assignments that teach them how to conduct  archival research and engage in historical analysis, students come to  understand how historians engage in their craft, how they construct  historical narratives, and how they ensure their accuracy. The course  culminates in a 15- to 20-page research paper. The second purpose of  this course is to learn about U.S. labor history, which includes not  only the study of the workplace but also how families interacted and  reacted to labor conditions as they lived their domestic lives.      Seminar: Writing  American History   HIST-UA 417 Offered  every year. Bender. 4 points.

This seminar investigates the historical development of the key ideologies of postwar American politics and their differing engagements with the central historical developments of that time period: the Cold War, civil rights movement, metropolitan development, feminism, environmentalism, and fiscal and monetary policy. It will investigate how liberalism and conservatism reshaped American society and politics at the various scales of American governance: grass-roots, state, regional, and national. As a research seminar, students will be expected to complete a piece of original research, on a topic of their choosing, over the course of the semester.    Seminar: Unbordered and Bordered Lands: North American Borderlands History HIST-UA 663 Offered every other year. 4 points. In this reading seminar, students will explore the major themes and historiographical approaches to the study of North American borderlands history. A rapidly expanding and vibrant field, borderlands history focuses on the interactions of peoples, nations, and empires across the boundaries of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Beginning with the earliest European claims to the continent, this course will explore recent writings on the interactions of Europeans and Native peoples as Spain, Britain, and France attempted to conquer North America. In the second half of the class, we will turn to the transition from empires to nation-states in North America and explore how Mexico, the United States, and Canada worked to assert state power and create national space and citizens in the borderlands between nations.      Seminar: Reading and  Writing Experimental History   HIST-UA 672 Hodes. 4  points.   Investigates and  evaluates the ways in which scholars attempt to expand the boundaries  of writing history. Focuses on the relationship between historical  evidence and the writing of history in new ways; relation between  scholar and subject; connections between history and speculation; use  of unconventional voices; re-creation of past worlds and lives; and  connections between history and storytelling.

Seminar: Ideology and  Social Change in American History   HIST-UA 684 Offered  every other year. 4 points.   Explores classical  arguments in American history concerning social behavior. Central  themes: the power of cultural conditioning, the role of schooling and  other acculturating institutions, the uses of \u201cuplifting\u201d reform  and organizational benevolence, and the intervention of professional  experts into social policymaking. Special attention to the role of  ethnic and racial leaders, proponents of success and socialization,  critical investigations of family and femininity, and analysis of  distinctive generational responses to these and related issues.      Seminar: The New Deal   HIST-UA 686 Offered  every year. Katz. 4 points.

Students choose  a research project, which they report on both orally and in a seminar  paper. Colloquium: Twentieth Century U.S. History in Film HIST-UA 694 Offered every other spring. 4 points. The purpose of this course is two-fold: to engage in critical examination of film and to analyze how film either captures or portrays specific moments in twentieth-century U.S. history. Throughout the semester, we will discuss major historical eras and events\u2014including the Great Depression, the Second World War, McCarthyism, the Cold War, the Civil Rights movement, Vietnam, and Watergate\u2014as we explore major film genres such as the social problem film, screwball comedy, the \u201cwoman\u2019s film,\u201d film noir, and Gen-X cinema. In terms of documentaries, we will view newsreels, government-produced films, historical documentaries, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and \u201cdocu-ganda.\u201d We will not necessarily focus upon whether filmic representations are historically accurate in fine detail. Rather, we shall carefully consider the ways in which filmic representations do\u2014and do not\u2014comment upon complex political, social, cultural, and historical dynamics. Lastly, we shall also consider key developments in cinema over the course of the twentieth century. Women, the Entertainment Industry, and the Blacklist Era HIST-UA 695 Offered every fall. 4 points. One of the darker epochs of American history were the years most commonly known as the McCarthy era, although the senator from Wisconsin played only a small part in the investigations of the entertainment industry. History also chooses to remember only the men whenever discussions of this period are presented. Long forgotten, more accurately ignored, many women were named, appeared before the Committees, and were victims of the blacklist. This course reviews the history of this period, and the women of the entertainment industry who appeared before the various Un-American Activities Committees from 1938-1958. Here is an opportunity to examine an important piece of the American story through a new lens, giving a fascinating group of women their place in the history of this period.    Seminar: Sport and Film  in American History   HIST-UA 698 Sammons. 4  points.   Investigates how a  visual medium (film), subject to the conventions of drama and  fiction, and a popular activity/institution (sport), often associated  with frivolity, violence, and puerility, might be used as serious  vehicles for conceptualizing and analyzing the past. Seminar: Histories of the U.S.-Mexico Border HIST-UA 756 4 points. The border between the United States and Mexico is both a meeting ground and a dividing line between two nations, cultures, and people. It has been a site of conflict and coexistence from the time it was created until the present. In the media the border most often appears as a site of controversy, violence, and national control that is defined by U.S. and Mexican policies concerning trade, immigration, and national security. But the border is more than this; it is a place where individuals, families, and communities have made their lives. The history of the border then is found not only in the pages of government reports and statistics, but in the memories, songs, and stories of border people. In this class we will explore some of the many histories of the border. A wide array of course materials\u2014including historical monographs, journalistic reports, oral histories, folk songs, and documentary and feature films\u2014will introduce students to the many ways that people use and make sense of the past. In the process we will seek not just to better understand the contemporary political issues focused on the border today, but the longer and richer history of the U.S.-Mexico border and the people who have lived along and across it.     History of Asia, Africa, and Latin America      Seminar: Capitalism in  South Asia   HIST-UA 327 Offered  every year. Sartori. 4 points.   Is capitalism a set of  global arrangements superimposed on a set of local cultures, a  long-term tendency of South Asian societies, or something that has  entered into the very structure of modern South Asian society? This  course explores a series of topics including the Indian Ocean trading  world; \u201cproto-industrialization\u201d in pre-colonial India; the East  India Company; deindustrialization, peasantization, and  traditionalization; continuity and transformation in peasant society;  developmentalist theories and pro-industrialization policies;  nationalism, decolonization, and political economy; and  neo-liberalism.

Rather, it takes up crucial issues in the history of each polity and  society, focusing primarily on Taiwan, thus allowing students to gain  an understanding of the complexities of Taiwanese history and society  and of this contested region of the world. The reading and writing  load are heavy, and students are expected to participate in class.  Some background in China\u2019s or Taiwan\u2019s history is desirable and  presumed.      Seminar: Topics in  Eurasian History   HIST-UA 533 Offered  every year. 4 points.   Focuses on major  historical issues and problems in the history of Eurasia, which is  the largest landmass in the world but is rarely treated as a region  or unit of historical analysis. Responds to recent shifts in the  field of history that emphasize frameworks larger than the  \u201cnation-state\u201d for historical research and analysis. Possible  topics: The Mongol Empire and Its Legacy; Early Modern Empires:  China, Russia, and the Ottomans; Scientific and Technological  Exchanges, 1225\u20132000; Eurasian Militaries; and Nomads and Nomadism  in Eurasia.

The war is dealt with in two senses: its meaning  for Japan\u2019s international history and its impact on the domestic  landscape. Readings are drawn from both primary and secondary sources  so that interpretative controversies as well as texts may be  discussed. Thematically, the course divides into sections: (1) the  great debates over Japanese fascism and ultranationalism; (2) the  China War; (3) the Pacific War; (4) the Coprosperity Sphere; (5) the  atom bomb, surrender, and occupation; and (6) issues of public memory  and war responsibility.

Many assume that bodies are ahistorical, unchanging, but this is not true. This seminar examines historical changes in physical bodies, perception of bodies, and treatment of the body over time; how social class, race, sex and region have contributed to these changes and to bodily diversity; and how national and international inequalities have affected the human body. Colloquium: Biography and History HIST-UA 669 Offered every other fall. 4 points. In this course, we will explore the ways in which the art and craft of biography can serve the study of history. Reading critically and thoughtfully, we will explore both conventional and unconventional biographies, by both academics and non-academics, treating subjects ranging from the well-known to the unknown, and beyond. Around the seminar table, we will ask how each work illuminates the study of history, with attention to such topics as research methods, sources, evidence, argument, style, voice, and the relationship between writer and subject. Throughout the semester, students will make their own forays into biography, sharing their work and reflecting on one another\u2019s efforts. Colloquium: Consumption and Consumer Culture in Comparative Perspective HIST-UA 671 Offered every other year. 4 points. This upper level class will explore the study of consumption and consumer culture.
