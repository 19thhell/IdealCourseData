Neverthless, who we think or say we are remains hugely important for the understanding of American history. Since 1995, in partnership with the Archives of Irish America, the central research initiative of Glucksman Ireland House, the Center for Irish Studies at New York University, has been an Oral History Project. Its goal is to record the experiences of a wide range of Irish Americans towards an understanding of the durability and elasticity of ethnic identity over time.    The principal interviewers are Dr. Linda Dowling Almeida, Dr. Marion R. Casey, and Dr. Miriam A. Nyhan. Special grant funding in 2008&#8211;2009 was generously provided by the Leon Lowenstein Foundation. An undergraduate course designed to teach oral history interviewing and documentation skills is offered by Glucksman Ireland House in the Fall semester; see http://irelandhouse.fas.nyu.edu/page/oralhistoryproject    The interviews that form this collection are usually full life histories which are recorded using digital technology. These audio files are then archived and opened to researchers by appointment through NYU&#8217;s Division of Libraries.
