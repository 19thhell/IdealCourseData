Emphasis is placed on understanding the pathogenesis and prevention of diseases and how micro- (i.e. person), meso- (i.e. social cohesion), and macro- (i.e. contextual) levels shape human behavior and decision making in relation to risk and disease. One focus of this concentration is on understanding health inequities, how issues of access explain health disparities and how such determinants help to inform the development of individual, social, and structural interventions to prevent disease. Students will be trained in quantitative, qualitative and mixed methodologies. Additionally, another major focus of the concentration is on the translation of knowledge to inform practice.

Researchers in this field examine systematic differences in outcomes across populations, interactions among health determinants, and the influence of multiple health determinants throughout the life cycle and across generations. Population health researchers and practitioners produce evidence that helps match interventions with population health needs, improves resource allocation, and reduces health disparities. They do this by engaging with decision-makers and communities to facilitate \u201cknowledge transfer and academic-practice partnerships required for positive change.\u201d (Kindig &amp; Stoddart, AmJ Public Health. 2003;93:380\u2013383)            The Curriculum          Doctoral students in the Population and Community Health concentration will follow a curriculum as outlined below.
