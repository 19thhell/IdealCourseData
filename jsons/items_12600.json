MAINT-GA 4747: Maintaining Matriculation Section 001, Class Nbr:1425 (MA Students) Section 004, Class Nbr:1428 (PhD Students who are post-funding) ANTH-GA 1000: Departmental Seminar: TBD Subfield core course, topic and instructors vary by year. This course examines a range of topics as simultaneously natural/cultural objects whose contemporary importance can only be understood through both biological and sociocultural analysis. ANTH-GA 1010: Social Anthropology Theory and Practice Introduces the principal theoretical issues in contemporary social anthropology, relating recent theoretical developments and ethnographic problems to their origins in classical sociological thought. Problems in the anthropology of knowledge are particularly emphasized as those most challenging to social anthropology and to related disciplines. ANTH-GA 1215: Culture and Media I This course offers a critical revision of the history of the genre of ethnographic film, the central debates it has engaged around cross-cultural representation, and the theoretical and cinematic responses to questions of the screen representation of culture, from the early romantic constructions of Robert Flaherty to current work in film, television, and video on the part of indigenous people throughout the world. ANTH-GA 1218: Video Production I Yearlong seminar in ethnographic documentary video production using state-of- the-art digital video equipment for students in the Program in Culture and Media. This course is dedicated to instruction, exercises, and reading familiarizing students with fundamentals of video production and their application to a broad conception of ethnographic and documentary approaches. ANTH-GA 1314 Ethnographic Traditions: Latin American Cities: Infrastructures of Indigeneity and Modernity This course attempts to think through the mutual imbrication of the rural village and the city in Latin America, a distinction central to 16th-century Spanish invaders, to colonial administrators, and to state planners and nationalist ideologues in the national era. Adopting a combined historical and ethnographic approach and working toward integrating an analytics of political economy with a performance-centered variety of socio-spatial analysis, the course seeks to identify the long term continuities as well as transformative breaks in the cultural, ecological, political, economic ties between rural and urban social orders. We begin by surveying pre-invasion European and Amerindian rural/urban formations, and by tracing out the successive shifts of the colonial, republican, and contemporary experience. On the one hand, we survey the essential theoretical foundations upon which rests much study of rural indigeneity, as well as urban modernity (and old and new forms of urban indigeneity), while on the other, we review \"decolonizing\" critiques of such accounts within an emerging Latin America-centered version of postcolonial studies. We explore the significance of infrastructure studies, postmodern geographies, theorizations of space, place, and locality, to understanding the reproduction or transformation of class and gender hierarchies, taking account of alternative frameworks for grasping non-localized, transmigrant social imaginaries ensuing from media studies and elsewhere. At the same time, we treat the deep intertwining of class, race, and gender and the performative inscription of their coordinates across the rural/urban divide as well as within rural and urban milieu, along with the bifurcated institutions of governance established therein, and consider the reproduction of inequality and cultural difference as corollary to the reproduction of the social privilege of urban elites whose values, perhaps, have historically enframed urban life and subtended to it rurality and the extra-urban environment. Ranging through rich works in rural and urban history produced over the last few decades, and the anthropologies of rural to urban migration, marketplaces, domestic service, festive life, nationalist movements, and populist politics, we inquire as to the possibilities for an ethnography of cities, rather than just in cities, that fully account for the imbrication in them of rural settings resource use, food provisioning, etc. The course focuses upon a series of case studies and a selection of particular cities and their respective human/agricultural/hydrological \"catchment basins\", large and small (some possibilities include Caracas, Havana, Santo Domingo, Mexico City, Cuzco, Lima, Quito, Potosi, La Paz, Buenos Aires, Salvador-Bahia, Rio de Janeiro). ANTH-GA 1516 Human Osteology &amp; Odontology Knowledge of human osteology forms the underpinning for advanced study in morphology, forensic anthropology, paleoanthropology, bioarcheology, and human skeletal biology. This course offers an intensive introduction to the human skeleton emphasizing the identification of fragmentary human remains. ANTH-GA 1517 Biological Variation Among Human Populations Despite the significance of culture in human adaptation, genetic variation and biological adaptability continue to affect human survival and reproduction in important ways. This course explores genetic, physiological, morphological, and behavioral variability in human populations today; its role in human adaptation; and its significance to our understanding of human evolution. ANTH-GA 2214 Archaelogical Methods and Techniques Archaeological Methods and Techniques is intended as an advanced coverage of the relationship between the questions asked by anthropological archaeologists and the techniques used to answer those questions. This semester the emphasis will be much more on techniques than on theory, although the relationship between the two is so reciprocal that it is fruitless to separate them. Another focus will be on the application of archaeological reasoning and methods to forensic anthropology. Among subjects to be included are total-station proveniencing, excavation methods, analysis of incremental structures for determination of age-and season-of-death for humans and animals, experimental protocols and optical microscopy. The goal of the course will be to expose students to a wide diversity of techniques in lectures and in presentation sessions. After the first few weeks, classes will be workshops for the development of particular analytical skills. Students will be required to conduct a focused piece of archaeological research, mastering and making use of a technique of their choosing (subject to availability of equipment, archaeological specimens and expertise). These projects must be chosen by the fourth week of the semester in consultation with the professor.The only requirement for the course is a semester-long project, the goal of which is to allow and enable students to develop research skills pertinent to their thesis or other research. The results of that project will be presented in class. ANTH-GA 3210 Professionalization Seminar (Archaeology) The archaeology professionalization seminar is open to faculty and students with interests in archaeology and related disciplines. All students enrolled in the Department of Anthropology Archaeology program are required to enroll in the seminar for one semester and updated throughout their careers in the department. This course is mandated by the RCR (Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research) and critical to \u201cthe public trust\u201d for scholars/scientists. Among the topics to be addressed are effective grant writing, constructive critique and peer review, ethical issues in publication and matters of cultural property, issues surrounding research permits and descendant communities, organizing inter-disciplinary and collaborative research, strategies for successfully applying for positions and procedures of potential employers, construction and design of course outlines for teaching, job options in academic and non-academic settings, presentation of papers at conferences or meetings, and ways to achieve a balance between research and life outside of archaeology. ANTH-GA 3211 Professionalization Seminar (Sociocultural/Linguistic) This course addresses the central skills and resources needed for a professional career in anthropology. Topics will include: how to apply to the human subjects review board; how to write grant applications; how to join professional associations; and how to be a successful teaching assistant. The course also provides an opportunity for students to present recent fieldwork experiences and to rehearse papers they plan to give at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association. Three dedicated sessions provide training toward certification in the \u201cResponsible Conduct of Research\u201d (RCR), which is now required by some federal granting agencies. Beginning in the academic year 2015-16, students will register for this course in the spring of the second year of the graduate program. ANTH-GA 3391 Topical Seminar: Primate Behavior (NYCEP Core) Required foundation course for students specializing in biological anthropology. Provides an introduction to concepts, methods and research findings in three main areas: primate socioecology and conservation; genetics, molecular anthropology and evolutionary theory; comparative anatomy, functional morphology and paleoanthropology. ANTH-GA 3392 Professional Development (Biological) This course aims to provide an introduction to many of the ethical issues that confront students and scholars in biological anthropology, as well as to provide practical training in professional skills that students will find essential in their early academic careers. The topics included in this course are not generally covered as part of traditional disciplinary courses, but they are considered just as critical for long term professional development. Individual classes will focus on ethical issues related to science in general, research with animals and humans, and professional relationships, and practical skills such as proposal writing, writing for publication, the peer review process, oral presentation, and how to succeed in the job market. The course is structured to encourage students to critically discuss and debate ethical issues from a more informed perspective, and to provide a forum for students to gain practical experience in honing their skills in both oral presentation and writing. Students will be evaluated on their in class contributions, as well as on short written assignments and presentations. ANTH-GA 3393 Paleoanthropology I This course provides a detailed overview of the early stages of human evolution from the Miocene to the early Pleistocene, focusing on the fossil and archaeological record of the earliest hominins up to and including early Homo in East and South Africa. It emphasizes the anatomical, phylogenetic, and behavioural traits of Plio-Pleistocene hominins in Africa. Special topics include: a critical review of recently described fossils purported to be early hominins from the late Miocene of Africa; an introduction to phylogenetic methods, geochronology, and the evidence used to reconstruct global climate change; comparative morphology and tool-using behavior of extant hominoids; the earliest tool industries; models of early hominin dietary behavior; functional morphology and locomotor behavior; and debates surrounding early hominin biogeography, taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships. Students will supplement their reading of the primary literature with the study of comparative skeletal materials and casts of early hominins in the laboratory. Requirements include a mid-term exam, final exam a research paper and a class project (which includes a small presentation). ANTH-GA 3394 Topical Seminar: Neoliberalism Within the last decade, anthropological interest and scholarship about neoliberalism has increased tremendously. A simple search of AnthroSource for the keywords, \u201cneoliberal\u201d or \u201cneoliberalism\u201d appearing in journal articles published since 1990 reveals that nearly 80 percent of this scholarship has been published since 2005. The growing usage of the terms, \u201cneoliberal\u201d and \u201cneoliberalism,\u201d within contemporary anthropological scholarship has even begun to attract criticism for being cursory or insufficiently theorized. This course examines current anthropological engagements with neoliberalism and explains why the concept has been so attractive for anthropologists since the millennium. Neoliberalism frequently functions as an index of the global political-economic order and allows for a vast array of ethnographic sites and topics to be contained within the same frame. In this course, we will learn about the history of neoliberal thought and how neoliberalism is different from late capitalism. We will discuss how anthropologists have most commonly understood and defined neoliberalism and surveyhow anthropologists have engaged with it in their own ethnographic work. The scholarship and hence the readings for the course are divided into three broad themes: neoliberalism as a structural force that affects people\u2019s lives and life-chances; neoliberalism as an ideology of governance that shapes subjectivities; and the sites and agents of neoliberal practice. Ethnographies and cases will be drawn from a broad geographic and institutional range. We will also discuss how as an analytical framework, neoliberalism can obscure ethnographic particularities and foreclose certain avenues of inquiry. We will discuss how at the heart of the criticisms and debates over the efficacy or inefficacy of neoliberalism as a theoretical framework lie long-standing anthropological concerns about scale, representation, comparison, and relevance.  ANTH-GA 3398 Contemporary Latino/Latin American Studies A look at contemporary cultural politics in Latino/ America paying attention to transnational dynamics and contemporary processes of neoliberalization. Special attention will be paid to the use and instrumentalization of culture throughout the Americas, and to some of the larger social, political and historical trends they help signal. Topics include: the politics of space and urbanization, immigration, comparative race/ethnic relations, and contemporary social movements. ANTH-GA 2600 Anthropology and Human Rights This course examines the contemporary elaboration and dissemination of human rights in the post-World War II period as law, discourse, and practice. This includes an analysis of its institutional grounding in United Nations institutions and non-governmental organizations and its changes over time. The course covers the historical opposition of the American Anthropological Association to human rights and its recent statement of support. It examines the opposition between culture and rights along with current theoretical efforts to negotiate an intermediate space. Current anthropological work focuses on the way human rights concepts and institutions are mobilized in particular political struggles in various parts of the world and how concepts of culture and rights are deployed in the global production and localization of human rights ideas. Specific areas of focus include indigenous rights, women's rights, transitional justice, and human rights monitoring by NGOs and treaty committees, including technologies of knowledge production and the use of indicators and benchmarks. The course discusses approaches to transnational, deterritorialized, and multi-sited ethnography as well as thegaps between human rights law and implementation. ANTH-GA 2700 Ethnographic Methods Examines theories and methods of ethnographic research, paying particular attention to the links between research questions and data collection techniques. In addition to readings, assignments include practice fieldwork exercises.  MSMS-GA 3330.003 Heritage, Memory, and Negotiating Temporalities What is heritage, how is it produced and to what extent does it (re)arrange relationships between time, memory and identity? How do some heritages come to be memorialized and institutionalized and others excluded and rendered peripheral? This seminar will cover the historical development of the concept of heritage as well as exploring the genesis of international heritage administration, charters, conventions, and national heritage laws. It will highlight emerging trends and practices including exploring the concept of \u201csocial memory\u201d and contrast it with the more formalized techniques of heritage didactics and curation. We will explore the increasing interest in \u201cbottom-up\u201d heritage programming that directly involves the general public in the formulation, collection, and public presentation of historical themes and subjects as an ongoing social activity. Case studies from different regions and social contexts will be explored: conflicted heritage, indigenous heritage, diasporic heritage, sites of conscience, long-term community planning and involvement in eco-museums, the relationship between heritage, development and tourism and public heritage interpretation centers. Students will be asked to address specific problems in sites or organizations presented during the course and will formulate socio-interpretive assessments of projects or research of their choosing in the U.S. or abroad. RELST-GA 1001 Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion Students will explore fundamental theoretical and methodological issues for the academic study of religion, including some of the more important theories of the origin, character, and function of religion as a human phenomenon. Psychological, sociological, anthropological, dialectical, post-colonial and feminist approaches will be addressed. The course will also explore some problems for the study of religion today: secularization theory and the intersection of religion and media.
