Professionals who understand these game-changing shifts similarly recognize our need for newer forms of management. That recognition leads them to the School of Engineering&#39;s MS program in Management (MSM).   The program is defined by a pragmatic, results-oriented approach emphasizing the integration of people and technology, which we achieve through courses designed to help you develop decision-making skills. Even subjects such as accounting, finance, and marketing are taught not as special areas of expertise, but as basic tools for managerial decision-making in a tech-heavy, knowledge-based workplace.   You&rsquo;ll build on such core competencies by focusing on 1 of the following concentrations:      entrepreneurship    electronic business    project management    technology management    information and telecommunications management    human resource management    construction management     By the program&rsquo;s end, you&rsquo;ll be able to allocate and direct human, financial, and physical resources, as well as technological and organizational assets, for maximum performance.   Best of all, you can learn these skills while maintaining a busy career since classes are typically scheduled after regular business hours.   Admission Requirements   Satisfactory scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or an acceptable equivalent test, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be requested to support admission.   The program requires some fundamental knowledge of probability and statistics. Students without such a background are required to take a managerial probability and statistics course such as MA 2054, MG 5050, or its equivalent. Students with this background may apply to waive this requirement.

It has traditionally offered its students the opportunity to specialize in one of three sub-specializations within Management: Organizational Behavior, Organization Theory, and Strategy. The programs seeks to help its students acquire the necessary background knowledge to become independent researchers and scholars in the field of management. The program encourages students to take an interdisciplinary approach to research if they so desire. Our program offers several advantages over competing schools: World-class Faculty. In a recent survey, Stern's Management Department was ranked fourth world-wide in terms of research productivity. Our faculty publish in and serve on editorial boards of all the leading management journals. Breadth &amp; Diversity. Because of the size of our faculty, we are able to offer a wide array of expertise across the broad research domain of management. With over twenty full-time professors, you are likely to find someone to mentor you no matter what your area of interest. Small Size. The small size of the program relative to the size of the department means that students can get very personalized attention from faculty. The Doctoral Coordinator makes every effort to match students with faculty who can help them develop research skills in their specific area of interest. Living Laboratory. As the center of international commerce, New York City offers amazing opportunities for conversing with managers and studying business organizations.
