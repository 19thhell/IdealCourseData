To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.

To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.

The dual MD/MSCI is designed for students interested in translational research who wish to develop skills needed to succeed in their future careers. Courses include: Research Design, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Drug Design, Grant Writing, and others. Most of the classes are offered in the first year of the program, with the second year reserved for a smaller number of classes and a more intensive research expectation.   Students wishing to participate in the program are chosen by competitive application, and must, at the time of application, have identified a research mentor and a tentative project or area of study. In additional to classroom didactics, students in the MSCI gain two other advantages from their participation. First, the Integrative Seminar, held weekly, provides students with the opportunity to present their work on a regular basis and obtain supportive, constructive feedback from their fellow students and one or more of the program directors. In this setting, students with a range of projects get to exchange ideas, share problems and solutions, and come to feel like a part of a vibrant community of researchers. In addition, each student in the program is required to meet, several times a year, with the MSCI program directors and the student\u2019s research mentor. In this way, the student\u2019s progress is dynamically tracked, benchmarks are set and assessed (these may include abstract submissions, manuscript submissions, presentations at meetings, grants, etc), and the student is supported in their drive for productivity and accomplishment. At the conclusion of the program, each student is required to present their work in a thesis defense.   Timeline:   In contrast to the typical program, which is part-time over two years, students in the dual degree program will take a dedicated year to work on their mentored research and participate in the majority of the MSCI classroom activities in a full-time capacity.   Subsequently students will resume their clinical training in the medical school while completing some minor coursework and continuing engagement in the research requirement begun during the MSCI program year. \u00a0   Students will apply a portion of their M.D. degree elective time in this final year, as well as any additional free time, to the continuing pursuit of their research project. In turn, the student may be granted up to 12 weeks of elective credit by the medical school as well as receiving Independent Research credits for this research work as part of the MSCI.\u00a0   Students in the dual degree program may begin their independent research project during the summer of year one of the MSCI program. In this manner, students will easily complete the required number of credits, as well as a significant research experience, within the expected time frame. \u00a0   As with other students in the program, dual-degree students will be required to make a final research presentation (thesis defense). In lieu of the grant proposal required for other students, medical students in the program will submit a written report of their research, in consideration of their thesis for the degree.   A sample proposed schedule for the MSCI Curriculum for students in the dual degree program is as follows:   \u00a0     Fall (includes summer months)       Spring     \u00a0   1st Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   2nd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   3rd Year   Medical School Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   4th Year (MSCI Year 1)   MSCI Curriculum   MSCI Curriculum   \u00a0   5th Year (MSCI Year 2)   Mecical School Curriculum/MSCI Curriculum   Medical School Curriculum   \u00a0   \u00a0     \u00a0       MSCI Year 1     \u00a0   \u00a0Fall   \u00a0Clinical Research Methods   \u00a0(3 Credits)   \u00a0 (including summer)   \u00a0Introduction to Biostatistics (Continued)   \u00a0(3 credits)   \u00a0   \u00a0Advanced Epidemiology or Developing New Drugs Selectives   \u00a0(3 Credits)   \u00a0   \u00a0Integrative Research Seminar   \u00a0(1 Credit)   \u00a0   \u00a0Independent Research   \u00a0(1 Credit)   \u00a0     Total:       11 Credits     \u00a0Spring   \u00a0Scientific Integrity and the Responsible Conduct of Research   \u00a0(0 Credits)   \u00a0   \u00a0Clinical Trial Design   \u00a0(4 Credits)   \u00a0   \u00a0Biomolecular Medicine   \u00a0(4 Credits)   \u00a0   \u00a0Integrative Seminar   \u00a0(1 Credit)   \u00a0   \u00a0Independent Research   \u00a0(3 Credits)   \u00a0   \u00a0Total:   12 Credits   \u00a0   MSCI Year 2   \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0Fall   \u00a0Medical Informatics   \u00a0(3 Credits)\u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0Integrative Seminar   \u00a0(1 Credit)   \u00a0   \u00a0Independent Research   \u00a0(5 Credits)   \u00a0     Total:     9 Credits   \u00a0     \u00a0Grand Total:       32 Credits     \u00a0   Application Process:   Students wishing to participate in the dual-degree MD/MSCI will be permitted to apply for the program either concurrently with their application for medical school or, preferably, during medical school at the time that they develop their interest in the program. \u00a0   Students wishing to apply concurrently with their medical school application will need to submit separate applications to each program, and receive acceptance to both, in order to be accepted into the dual degree. Such students will be exempt from the requirement to identify a project and mentor (though a statement of research interest will be required), and will be guaranteed a place in the program, contingent upon their identifying an acceptable project and mentor by the time of their entry into the program, as well as the requirement to remain in good academic standing. \u00a0   Students wishing to apply during medical school will generally be expected to submit their application during the spring semester prior to their fall participation. Upon acceptance to the MSCI, students will develop a curricular timeline in consultation with both the School of Medicine and MSCI Program. \u00a0   Tuition and Funding:   The total cost of tuition for the 32-credit MSCI portion of the dual degree for the 2014-2015 academic year is approximately $32,000. However, NIH funding through the CTSI permits the program to charge students a deeply discounted rate, approximately $15,000 (as of 2014).\u00a0 Payment of MSCI tuition will be the responsibility of the participating student; the School of Medicine may assist the student in identifying sources of funds where available.   In addition, students will be charged full medical school fees during the dedicated MSCI year.
