Three Centuries of English and American Plays: a checklist. United States: 1714-1830 . New York: Hafner, 1963.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 B45 (also on microform)   Compiled as an index to the Readex Microprint edition of Three  Centuries of English and American Plays, this checklist can stand on  its own as a bibliography of 5,500 plays written between 1500 and 1830.  Entries are arranged by playwright and list the earliest edition known  and significant later editions for each play. Anonymous works can be  found under their titles. Entries include brief bibliographical  information and chronological period to which the play belongs. As  there is no title index readers must know the playwright&#39;s name when  looking for a specific play.         Dubois, William R. English  and American Stage Productions: An Annotated Checklist of Prompt Books  1800-1900 from the Nisbet-Snyder Drama Collection, Northern Illinois  University Libraries . Boston: G.K. Hall, 1973    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 D85   Prompt books and production editions of plays are valuable resources to  theatre historians because they often contain notes that illuminate  historical practices in staging and production. This work catalogs more  than 2,000 promptbooks and prompter&#39;s editions of plays that form a  collection held by the Northern Illinois Univ. Library. The plays were  produced on the American and English stage between 1775 and 1900, and  these books were used and annotated by directors and actors of those  productions. Entries are arranged alphabetically by playwright. Each  entry includes a physical description of the promptbook, a description  of its covers and any handwritten marks in the text, the date of the  earliest recorded New York or London production, and references to  secondary sources. Indexes provide additional access by play titles and  names of persons mentioned in the text.         Ellis, James ed. English Drama of the Nineteenth Century: an index and finding guide . New Canaan, CT: Readex Books, 1985.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 E42 1985 c.1   This single alphabetical listing by author and title of approximately  9,000 plays constitutes a substantial bibliography of  nineteenth-century English drama. Its primary purpose, however is as an  index and finding guide to the English plays issued through 1981 in the  Readex Microprint Collection English and American Drama of the  Nineteenth Century. It ranges far beyond the drama proper to include  children&#39;s plays, pantomime books of words, minstrel dialogues, solo  entertainments, opera libretti and vocal scores, and translations of  Continental dramatists from Aeschylus to Ibsen. The earlier English  dramatists, most particularly Shakespeare, are well represented in  collected series of the standard repertory and in acting editions  citing nineteenth-century casts and reflecting stage productions from  the time of Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble to that of Henry  Irving and Ellen Terry.         Hixon, Don L. and Hennessee, Don A. Nineteenth-Century American Drama: a finding guide . Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1977.    Bobst Ref1 PS632.H57   The Readex Corporation&#39;s English and American Drama of the 19th Century  microprint collection is a monumental work, containing thousands of  plays. It is located in the Microprint section of Bobst on the A Level.  Because of the difficulty of access, Hixon and Hennessee created an  index to part of the collection entitled &quot;American Plays, 1831-1900&quot;.  That section includes 4,500 plays. Authors and titles are arranged  alphabetically with all titles cross-referenced to authors. Because  Readex classified some plays under their adapters&#39; names instead of  their authors (for instance Shakespeare&#39;s works are listed under  various adaptors&#39; names), Hixon and Hennessee provide cross-references.  Appendices include one for series of plays, an ethnic/racial cast index  and a subject/form index. This last section locates children&#39;s plays,  minstrel plays, temperance plays, and so forth.         Litto, Fredric M. American Dissertations on the Drama and the Theatre: a bibliography . Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1969.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.L56   Litto uses a computer to compile this list of 4,565 dissertations  containing information about the theatrical arts. Although access is  provided by author, sufficient and keyword-in-context indexes, the  actual bibliography is arranged by a computer-generated reference mode.  Each entry lists the author and title of the dissertation along with  university and department names, degree granted, and date. Since this  work stops at 1965, one must use Dissertation Abstracts International  and the lists published annually in Theatre Journal (formerly  Educational Theatre Journal) to find more recent theses.         Pence, James Harry. The Magazine and the Drama: An index . (Theatre and Drama Series, 12) New York: Burt Franklin, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 P43 1970   An early attempt to index theatre articles in the periodical  literature, Pence&#39;s work locates articles about &quot;acted drama&quot; in 166  nineteenth-century magazines. These include Blackwood&#39;s, Godey&#39;s,  Lippincott&#39;s, McClure&#39;s, and the Spectator as well as other lesser  known titles. Although Pence does not state the years he has indexed  they appear to be from around 1872 to 1896. Subjects and authors appear  in one alphabet, and citations list periodical, volume, beginning page,  and (sometimes) date. The most reliable indexing is by personal name,  but one can find information on topics such as &quot;voice, culture of&quot; and  &quot;German stage.&quot; The usefulness of this volume depends in part on the  availability of nineteenth-century periodicals.         Stratman, Carl Joseph. American Theatrical Periodicals, 1789-1967 . Durham, NC Duke Univ. Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z6935.S75   Stratman has listed in chronological order all known theatrical  periodicals published in the United States to 1967. Although he found  685 titles, he warned that this first effort was likely incomplete.  Entries list bibliographic citations and holdings in several American  libraries. Using the index, readers can locate periodical titles,  editors, cities of publication, organizations sponsoring periodicals  and some keywords-in-the-title terms such as &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;dance,&quot; or  &quot;repertory.&quot; Stratman explains the use of the bibliography and index in  a clearly written introduction. Although now in need of an update, this  work will help those looking for older periodicals.                     Encyclopedias, Dictionaries and Histories          Brockett. Oscar G.

Bryan, George B. Stage Deaths: A Biographical Guide to International Theatrical Obituaries, 1850 to 1900 . Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1991.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.S76 1991 vol. 1 &amp; 2   A useful guide to obituaries and biographies of both famous and obscure  &quot;theatrical artists&quot;. He includes thousands of actors, dancers, circus  performers, film stars and theatre historians in two volumes of  alphabetically arranged entries. Entries cite obituaries in nine  newspapers, including the New York times and The times (London) as well  as book-length biographies and autobiographies. Because date and place  of death are given, readers can check local newspapers for additional  death notices. This set compliments the Variety obituaries (begins at  1905) well because it extends further back in time and because it cites  additional sources.         Hartnoll, Phylis. The Oxford Companion to the Theatre . 4th ed. New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2035.H3 1983   Offers concise, authoritative essays on all forms of theater, from  street performance to legitimate stage, from ancient Greece to the  present.

New York: McGraw Hill, 1984.    Bobst Ref1 PN1625.M3 1984 vol. 1-5   A truly wonderful encyclopedia comprehensive in scope. The 2nd ed.  expands both the text and pictorial content. All articles were written,  revised or updated by contributors who are active in the academic or  practical theatre world. Coverage on dramatists comprises five  sections; biographical outlining the highlights of a dramatists life,  analytical assessing creative achievements, synopses of major plays and  a play list.         Ireland, Joseph N. Records of the New York Stage from 1750 to 1860 . New York: B. Blom, 1966. [reprint of 1866 ed.]    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 I7 1966 vol. 1 &amp; 2   An ancestor to Odell&#39;s Annals of the New York Stage.  Ireland discusses performances in various New York theaters up to the Civil War.  Written in a narrative style, each chapter contains cast lists for plays produced during a particular year.  Ireland comments on various actors and actresses and provides some death notices.  A general index appears at the end of the second volume.  Use this work to supplement Odell.        Merserve, Walter J. An Outline History of American Drama . 2nd ed. New York: Feedback Theatrebooks &amp; Prospero Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PS332.M4 1994   Focuses on American plays and playwrights from the Colonial period to  present day. Topics discussed in terms of historical development, the  achievements of particular dramatists, and the contribution of  particular plays. Each chapter relates the progress of dramatic  criticism and the achievements of the theatre to a developing American  drama.         Mullin, Donald. Victorian  Actors and Actresses in Review: a Dictionary of Contemporary Views of  Representative British and American Actors and Actresses, 1837-1901 . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2597.V5 1983   Mullin has collected excerpts of Victorian criticism of 234 actors and  actresses of the period. So that the reader can consider the leading  players in relation to their supporting actors, Mullin includes reviews  of both stars and unknowns. For both he selects criticism of the actors  abilities in general and criticism of their performance of specific  roles. Critics quoted include George Bernard Shaw, Otis Skinner, and  William Winter, the &quot;doyen of New York theatre critics.&quot; Entries are  arranged alphabetically and include the actor&#39;s dates and nationality.  Excerpts are arranged chronologically. Full bibliographic information  for each citation in the bibliography is included. A subject index  completes the volume.         Odell, George C.D. Annals of the New York Stage, Before 1789-1894 . New York: AMS Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 04 1970 vol. 1-15   This history of the New York Stage relies on newspaper articles and other primary source materials.  The definitive history of early New York Theatre.        Slide Anthony. Encyclopedia of Vaudeville . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PN1968.U5 S37 1994   Focusing on personalities, including performers, creative talents, and  administrators, but also including entries on theaters, genres, etc.,  this is the first comprehensive encyclopedia on Vaudeville. Each entry,  when appropriate, includes a very brief bibliography. A guide to  Vaudeville research resources available in libraries is also included.         Wilmeth, Don B. and Miller, Tice L. Cambridge Guide to American Theatre . Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993.    Bobst Ref1 PN2220.C35 1993   This Cambridge work rivals the Oxford Companion the American Theatre in  its ability to provide short, factual answers to questions about the  world of American theatre. Eighty writers, including many of the  best-known theatre historians, inform readers about all subjects  related to the Theatre and to vaudeville, burlesque, the circus, magic,  and film festivals. Cambridge is more inclusive than Oxford whose scope  includes only legitimate theatre. Cambridge also does a better job with  the histories of major American cities such as Baltimore and  Philadelphia. Oxford, however, provides many more entries for  individual plays and persons. Cambridge includes a bibliography written  by Wilmeth and a introductory historical survey. At the moment,  Cambridge is more up-to-date than Oxford, but that advantage will  alternate as additional editions are issued.         Young, William C. Famous American Playhouses in the series Documents of American Theater History . Chicago: American Library Association, 1973.    Bobst Ref1 NA6830.Y68 vol. 1 &amp; 2   Vol. 1 covers theatre buildings from 1716-1899, Vol. 2 from 1900-1971.  In addition to brief overview of period each volume contain source  material from magazines and newspapers plus illustrations and  photographs.         Young, William C. Famous Actors and Actresses on the American Stage in the series Documents of American Theater History . New York: R.R. Bowker, 1975.    Bobst Ref1 PN2285.Y6 1975b vol. 1 &amp; 2   Presents information about 225 American actors, mostly from the  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He uses excerpts from articles,  interviews, and reviews published at the time the actor was working to  present both the actor&#39;s views on the profession and the critical  reception of his or her work. Chapters are arranged alphabetically by  name and excerpts are presented with citations at the end of each  chapter. The book is useful only as a beginning point. Young includes a  general index and a chronological index as well as a bibliography at  the end of the volume.

Three Centuries of English and American Plays: a checklist. United States: 1714-1830 . New York: Hafner, 1963.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 B45 (also on microform)   Compiled as an index to the Readex Microprint edition of Three  Centuries of English and American Plays, this checklist can stand on  its own as a bibliography of 5,500 plays written between 1500 and 1830.  Entries are arranged by playwright and list the earliest edition known  and significant later editions for each play. Anonymous works can be  found under their titles. Entries include brief bibliographical  information and chronological period to which the play belongs. As  there is no title index readers must know the playwright&#39;s name when  looking for a specific play.         Dubois, William R. English  and American Stage Productions: An Annotated Checklist of Prompt Books  1800-1900 from the Nisbet-Snyder Drama Collection, Northern Illinois  University Libraries . Boston: G.K. Hall, 1973    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 D85   Prompt books and production editions of plays are valuable resources to  theatre historians because they often contain notes that illuminate  historical practices in staging and production. This work catalogs more  than 2,000 promptbooks and prompter&#39;s editions of plays that form a  collection held by the Northern Illinois Univ. Library. The plays were  produced on the American and English stage between 1775 and 1900, and  these books were used and annotated by directors and actors of those  productions. Entries are arranged alphabetically by playwright. Each  entry includes a physical description of the promptbook, a description  of its covers and any handwritten marks in the text, the date of the  earliest recorded New York or London production, and references to  secondary sources. Indexes provide additional access by play titles and  names of persons mentioned in the text.         Ellis, James ed. English Drama of the Nineteenth Century: an index and finding guide . New Canaan, CT: Readex Books, 1985.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 E42 1985 c.1   This single alphabetical listing by author and title of approximately  9,000 plays constitutes a substantial bibliography of  nineteenth-century English drama. Its primary purpose, however is as an  index and finding guide to the English plays issued through 1981 in the  Readex Microprint Collection English and American Drama of the  Nineteenth Century. It ranges far beyond the drama proper to include  children&#39;s plays, pantomime books of words, minstrel dialogues, solo  entertainments, opera libretti and vocal scores, and translations of  Continental dramatists from Aeschylus to Ibsen. The earlier English  dramatists, most particularly Shakespeare, are well represented in  collected series of the standard repertory and in acting editions  citing nineteenth-century casts and reflecting stage productions from  the time of Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble to that of Henry  Irving and Ellen Terry.         Hixon, Don L. and Hennessee, Don A. Nineteenth-Century American Drama: a finding guide . Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1977.    Bobst Ref1 PS632.H57   The Readex Corporation&#39;s English and American Drama of the 19th Century  microprint collection is a monumental work, containing thousands of  plays. It is located in the Microprint section of Bobst on the A Level.  Because of the difficulty of access, Hixon and Hennessee created an  index to part of the collection entitled &quot;American Plays, 1831-1900&quot;.  That section includes 4,500 plays. Authors and titles are arranged  alphabetically with all titles cross-referenced to authors. Because  Readex classified some plays under their adapters&#39; names instead of  their authors (for instance Shakespeare&#39;s works are listed under  various adaptors&#39; names), Hixon and Hennessee provide cross-references.  Appendices include one for series of plays, an ethnic/racial cast index  and a subject/form index. This last section locates children&#39;s plays,  minstrel plays, temperance plays, and so forth.         Litto, Fredric M. American Dissertations on the Drama and the Theatre: a bibliography . Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1969.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.L56   Litto uses a computer to compile this list of 4,565 dissertations  containing information about the theatrical arts. Although access is  provided by author, sufficient and keyword-in-context indexes, the  actual bibliography is arranged by a computer-generated reference mode.  Each entry lists the author and title of the dissertation along with  university and department names, degree granted, and date. Since this  work stops at 1965, one must use Dissertation Abstracts International  and the lists published annually in Theatre Journal (formerly  Educational Theatre Journal) to find more recent theses.         Pence, James Harry. The Magazine and the Drama: An index . (Theatre and Drama Series, 12) New York: Burt Franklin, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 P43 1970   An early attempt to index theatre articles in the periodical  literature, Pence&#39;s work locates articles about &quot;acted drama&quot; in 166  nineteenth-century magazines. These include Blackwood&#39;s, Godey&#39;s,  Lippincott&#39;s, McClure&#39;s, and the Spectator as well as other lesser  known titles. Although Pence does not state the years he has indexed  they appear to be from around 1872 to 1896. Subjects and authors appear  in one alphabet, and citations list periodical, volume, beginning page,  and (sometimes) date. The most reliable indexing is by personal name,  but one can find information on topics such as &quot;voice, culture of&quot; and  &quot;German stage.&quot; The usefulness of this volume depends in part on the  availability of nineteenth-century periodicals.         Stratman, Carl Joseph. American Theatrical Periodicals, 1789-1967 . Durham, NC Duke Univ. Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z6935.S75   Stratman has listed in chronological order all known theatrical  periodicals published in the United States to 1967. Although he found  685 titles, he warned that this first effort was likely incomplete.  Entries list bibliographic citations and holdings in several American  libraries. Using the index, readers can locate periodical titles,  editors, cities of publication, organizations sponsoring periodicals  and some keywords-in-the-title terms such as &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;dance,&quot; or  &quot;repertory.&quot; Stratman explains the use of the bibliography and index in  a clearly written introduction. Although now in need of an update, this  work will help those looking for older periodicals.                     Encyclopedias, Dictionaries and Histories          Brockett. Oscar G.

Bryan, George B. Stage Deaths: A Biographical Guide to International Theatrical Obituaries, 1850 to 1900 . Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1991.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781.S76 1991 vol. 1 &amp; 2   A useful guide to obituaries and biographies of both famous and obscure  &quot;theatrical artists&quot;. He includes thousands of actors, dancers, circus  performers, film stars and theatre historians in two volumes of  alphabetically arranged entries. Entries cite obituaries in nine  newspapers, including the New York times and The times (London) as well  as book-length biographies and autobiographies. Because date and place  of death are given, readers can check local newspapers for additional  death notices. This set compliments the Variety obituaries (begins at  1905) well because it extends further back in time and because it cites  additional sources.         Hartnoll, Phylis. The Oxford Companion to the Theatre . 4th ed. New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1983.

New York: McGraw Hill, 1984.    Bobst Ref1 PN1625.M3 1984 vol. 1-5   A truly wonderful encyclopedia comprehensive in scope. The 2nd ed.  expands both the text and pictorial content. All articles were written,  revised or updated by contributors who are active in the academic or  practical theatre world. Coverage on dramatists comprises five  sections; biographical outlining the highlights of a dramatists life,  analytical assessing creative achievements, synopses of major plays and  a play list.         Ireland, Joseph N. Records of the New York Stage from 1750 to 1860 . New York: B. Blom, 1966. [reprint of 1866 ed.]    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 I7 1966 vol. 1 &amp; 2   An ancestor to Odell&#39;s Annals of the New York Stage.  Ireland discusses performances in various New York theaters up to the Civil War.  Written in a narrative style, each chapter contains cast lists for plays produced during a particular year.  Ireland comments on various actors and actresses and provides some death notices.  A general index appears at the end of the second volume.  Use this work to supplement Odell.        Merserve, Walter J. An Outline History of American Drama . 2nd ed. New York: Feedback Theatrebooks &amp; Prospero Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PS332.M4 1994   Focuses on American plays and playwrights from the Colonial period to  present day. Topics discussed in terms of historical development, the  achievements of particular dramatists, and the contribution of  particular plays. Each chapter relates the progress of dramatic  criticism and the achievements of the theatre to a developing American  drama.         Mullin, Donald. Victorian  Actors and Actresses in Review: a Dictionary of Contemporary Views of  Representative British and American Actors and Actresses, 1837-1901 . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983.    Bobst Ref1 PN2597.V5 1983   Mullin has collected excerpts of Victorian criticism of 234 actors and  actresses of the period. So that the reader can consider the leading  players in relation to their supporting actors, Mullin includes reviews  of both stars and unknowns. For both he selects criticism of the actors  abilities in general and criticism of their performance of specific  roles. Critics quoted include George Bernard Shaw, Otis Skinner, and  William Winter, the &quot;doyen of New York theatre critics.&quot; Entries are  arranged alphabetically and include the actor&#39;s dates and nationality.  Excerpts are arranged chronologically. Full bibliographic information  for each citation in the bibliography is included. A subject index  completes the volume.         Odell, George C.D. Annals of the New York Stage, Before 1789-1894 . New York: AMS Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 PN2277.N5 04 1970 vol. 1-15   This history of the New York Stage relies on newspaper articles and other primary source materials.  The definitive history of early New York Theatre.        Slide Anthony. Encyclopedia of Vaudeville . Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1994.    Bobst Ref1 PN1968.U5 S37 1994   Focusing on personalities, including performers, creative talents, and  administrators, but also including entries on theaters, genres, etc.,  this is the first comprehensive encyclopedia on Vaudeville. Each entry,  when appropriate, includes a very brief bibliography. A guide to  Vaudeville research resources available in libraries is also included.         Wilmeth, Don B. and Miller, Tice L. Cambridge Guide to American Theatre . Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993.    Bobst Ref1 PN2220.C35 1993   This Cambridge work rivals the Oxford Companion the American Theatre in  its ability to provide short, factual answers to questions about the  world of American theatre. Eighty writers, including many of the  best-known theatre historians, inform readers about all subjects  related to the Theatre and to vaudeville, burlesque, the circus, magic,  and film festivals. Cambridge is more inclusive than Oxford whose scope  includes only legitimate theatre. Cambridge also does a better job with  the histories of major American cities such as Baltimore and  Philadelphia. Oxford, however, provides many more entries for  individual plays and persons. Cambridge includes a bibliography written  by Wilmeth and a introductory historical survey. At the moment,  Cambridge is more up-to-date than Oxford, but that advantage will  alternate as additional editions are issued.         Young, William C. Famous American Playhouses in the series Documents of American Theater History . Chicago: American Library Association, 1973.    Bobst Ref1 NA6830.Y68 vol. 1 &amp; 2   Vol. 1 covers theatre buildings from 1716-1899, Vol. 2 from 1900-1971.  In addition to brief overview of period each volume contain source  material from magazines and newspapers plus illustrations and  photographs.         Young, William C. Famous Actors and Actresses on the American Stage in the series Documents of American Theater History . New York: R.R. Bowker, 1975.    Bobst Ref1 PN2285.Y6 1975b vol. 1 &amp; 2   Presents information about 225 American actors, mostly from the  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He uses excerpts from articles,  interviews, and reviews published at the time the actor was working to  present both the actor&#39;s views on the profession and the critical  reception of his or her work. Chapters are arranged alphabetically by  name and excerpts are presented with citations at the end of each  chapter. The book is useful only as a beginning point. Young includes a  general index and a chronological index as well as a bibliography at  the end of the volume.

Course Description: The culture and history of the Caribbean islands will be at the center of this interdisciplinary colloquium. The class will be organized around key moments of Caribbean history: slavery and the struggles against it, colonialism and independence movements, U.S. occupations, dictatorships, and revolutionary movements, the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora, and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. We will work with both literary texts and primary sources; we will also study some of the most influential approaches to the Caribbean in cultural studies, anthropology, and history.    Back to top    Seminars     LATC-GA 1014 \u2014 Tpcs: Sociology of the Image: Orality, Performance, and the Gaze in the Andes Day/Time: Wednesday, 9:30am - 12:00pm Prof. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Visiting Andres Bello Chair of Latin American Literature and Culture Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description:    Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui is a Bolivian sociologist, historian, activist, filmmaker, and public intellectual of Aymara descent. Founding Director of the Andean Oral History Workshop, she is a leading scholar of postcolonialtiy and indigeneity in the Andes. She published the classic, Oppressed but Not Defeated: Peasant Struggles Among the Aymara and Quechua in Bolivia, 1910-1980, and numerous essays on subaltern critiques of neoliberalism. A Professor emeritus of Sociology a the Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz, she has lectured widely throughout the hemisphere.   Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui proposes a new approach to decolonizing practice. \"Sociology of the Image\" refers to a teaching and research methodology developed at the University of La Paz, focused on bilingual Aymara students' daily experiences at the university and at home, and the historical memories of their families. The goal is to guide them to pertinent sociological and political research and action, to overcome the ventriloquist quality of the social sciences, and to develop a more autonomous relation with the Euro-North American conceptual world. Her work engages visual art and photography as well as film, and is designed to challenge inherited knowledge and produce an alternative view of colonial iconography and popular religiosity. The course will be taught in English, with some readings in Spanish.    LATC-GA 1017 - Government &amp; Politics of Latin America Day/Time: Tuesday, 5:00pm - 7:00pm Prof. Patricio Navia Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: As a social science, political science differs from other disciplines in that its basic object of study is the State and the way individuals and groups of individuals relate, interact and respond to the State. Political parties, institutions and collective behavior of individuals are central components in the field. Thus, political science will often focus more on political parties, the military, government bureaucracies and revolutionary forces than on labor unions, peasants or disposed groups. In short, political science tends to show a bias towards elite studies. Perhaps as a signal that traditionally disposed groups are acquiring greater political power, non-elite studies have grown and enriched the field in recent years. Yet, the primary research focus continues to be the State and how different groups influence (or seek to influence) the State.    LATC-GA 1020 \u2013 Tpcs: Political Paradigms in Action: The Social Dynamics of Citizenship in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean Day/Time: Wednesday, 5:00pm - 7:30pm Prof. Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This seminar will critically approach three paradigms that have shaped the construction of the nation-state and the emergence of citizenships in Latin America and the Caribbean: the Enlightenment, Emancipation and Multiculturalism. These intersecting political paradigms have been more clearly articulated by privileged individuals such as Bol\u00edvar, Mart\u00ed or Freyre. However, we will study the social processes behind these paradigms, highlighting the role, challenges and contradictions of collective action, and the interplay between political discourse and everyday life experiences. This seminar will examine citizenship not merely as a political category but as a dynamic social process of political belonging. Students will read bibliography regarding different but interconnected places such as Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, and even intensely Caribbean New Orleans.    LATC-GA 1048 \u2013 International Human Rights in Latin America Day/Time: Thursday, 6:00pm-9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: In this graduate seminar, students will study the international human rights standards and principals, topical case studies in Latin America, the role of international and local NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the human rights movement, popular resistance and social movements in the Latin American human rights movement, and the role of media and representation in reporting and promoting human rights.    LATC-GA 2030 Tpcs: Ethnographic Methods in Latin American and Caribbean Studies  Day/Time: Tuesday, 2:00pm - 4:00pm Prof. Katherine Smith Location: KJCC 404W Course Description: This course will introduce students to ethnographic methods, offer an overview of different types of ethnography, and reflect critically on the practice of ethnography. Through a series of fieldwork exercises and readings students will learn practical skills related to fieldwork, such as note-taking and interviewing. The course readings will also survey different ethnographic perspectives--such as feminist ethnography, thick description, visual ethnography, and historical ethnography--each of which engenders certain critiques of the limits of qualitative research and empiricism.       Back to top    Languages  LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I [Same as: SPAN-UA 81] Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: 25 W4-C17 Course Syllabus Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

LATC-GA 3050 - Internship Seminar Day/Time: TBD Prof: Pamela Calla Location: TBD    Back to top    Courses of Interest Offered in Other Departments at NYU    ANTH-GA 3392 \u2014 Colonialism, Nationalism, Modernity: Indians and Indigeneity in the Rural and Urban Andes Day/Time: Wednesday, 5:00pm - 7:30pm Prof. Thomas Abercrombie Location: TBA Course Description: This seminar queries the invention, colonial construction, nationalist problematics, and scholarly reproduction (in history and anthropology), of distinctions among the lived categories of \"Spanish/white,\" mestizo, cholo, and \"indian\" in the countryside and cities of the Andean region (present day Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile). The course begins with a survey of Andean ethnohistory, the interdiscipline that supplements archaeology to \"reconstruct\" indigenous societies prior to the 1532 Spanish invasion through written evidence. It then examines in depth the colonizing and state practices of surveillance and control, and the intellectual pursuits of folklore and anthropology, through which \"indigeneity\" has been produced and sustained in these settler societies to generate the \"modernity\" of the region's non-indigenous inhabitants (and of a succession of imperial metropoles) from the colonial through republican eras to the present. Tracking the succession of key concepts of difference through which social hierarchy has been policed (from 16th-century \"naci\u00f3n\" to 19th-century \"decencia\" to 20th-century \"raza,\" \"etnicidad,\" and \"cultura\"), the seminar considers the longevity of coloniality as well as moments of attempted decolonization. We compare such processes in Andean territory with those of other settler colonies (and with \"non-Andean\" parts of the Andean countries) to ask what differences resulted from the \"Inca-region\" proclivity for rule of large polities by hereditary aristocracy and the state-friendly inclination to provide tribute and labor service, and the long term impact of colonial rule of such polities through Christian confraternal practices, the assignment of collective property rights, and local government via elected councils of commoners, both in rural \"indigenous\" towns and in urban indian parish/neighborhoods. Along with claims about indigenous collectivism, reciprocity, and \"different\" experience of space-time, we particularly question the construal of indigeneity (by colonizers, nation-states, oligarchs, anthropologists, and tourists) via assertions of ontological difference (\"non-Western\" boundaries among persons, things, animals, and \"natural forces\").    ECON-GA 1605 \u2014 Latin American Economics Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:00pm - 6:00pm Prof. Ernest Brown Location: 19W4 736 Course Description: Provides an understanding of economic relationships in the Latin American-Caribbean region through an examination of the leading issues and key problems that these countries face in developing and modernizing their economies. Topics include a brief historical outline; a comparison of heterodox Latin American economic thought to neoclassical theories of growth and development; external equilibrium; foreign trade, balance of payments, exchange rates, foreign investments, and external debt.

LATC-GA 2532 - Tinker Colloquium I: Slavery, Race, and Social Identities: The Case of Brazil in Atlantic Perspective [History GXXX] Day/Time: TBA Prof. Hebe Mattos Location: TBA Course Description: The seminar examines how social identities and racial categories have been historically related in Brazil and the process by which they were constructed during the slave period and in the aftermath of abolition.    LATC-GA 2535 \u2013 Remapping Citizenship in 19th Century Mexico (4 points) [LCRS G6260] Day/Time: Wednesday, 2:10pm - 4:00pm Prof. Frida Osorio Location: (CU) 802 IAB Course Description: This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore the relationship between individuals and the emerging national Mexican state. Assuming that the state is not an abstract entity that stands above a mass of equal individuals, but a dynamic space where there is a continuous adjustment and bargaining between them, the main aim is to enable students to observe how the formation of the Mexican national state was a process in which different groups, including subalterns, had an active role. Examining issues of sovereignty, representation, pronunciamientos, federalism, justice, racial and ethnic relations, sex and gender, among others, two interrelated topics will be studied: the ways that society and the state were conceived by political elites and how responses given by majorities to the elite\u2019s political projects affected Mexican political life. We also will be mindful of how state formation was a multilateral process where institutions were constructed, negotiated and contested by a myriad of social actors.    LATC-GA 2536 \u2013 Bodies and Populations in Latin American History [History G9663] Day/Time: Wednesday, 11:00pm-12:50pm Prof. Nara Milanich Location: TBA Course Description: Examines colonial and modern Latin American history through a focus on biopolitics. In addition to transversal themes of gender, sexuality, and race, considers a range of thematic topics including slavery, discipline and punishment, labor and migration, identification practices, criminality, eugenics, demography, citizenship, reproduction, and public health.    LATC-GA 2537 \u2013 Art and Late Capitalism in Latin America [Spanish G6475] Day/Time: Thursday, 1:10pm-4:00pm Prof. Karen Benezra Location: TBA Course Description: This course will examine the ways in which visual art and art theory thought the emergence of post-industrial capitalism in Latin America. Beginning in the 1960s, the so-called dematerialization of art transformed the field of artistic and theoretical production into a fertile ground for posing questions about art\u2019s autonomy from both culture and the social relations of production. We will explore the ways in which artists, critics and theorists revisited issues such as the definition and necessity of the avant-garde, the socialization of art and labor, the historical inheritance of artistic and gremial collectivism and the relationship between art and ideology in light of the social, historic and psychic changes wrought by the emergence of a new phase of capitalist production. In attempting to historicize art\u2019s dematerialization, the course also seeks to raise broader questions about the periodization and contradictory articulation of late capitalism and its social effects in the global periphery.

Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 B45 (also on microform)   Compiled as an index to the Readex Microprint edition of Three  Centuries of English and American Plays, this checklist can stand on  its own as a bibliography of 5,500 plays written between 1500 and 1830.  Entries are arranged by playwright and list the earliest edition known  and significant later editions for each play. Anonymous works can be  found under their titles. Entries include brief bibliographical  information and chronological period to which the play belongs. As  there is no title index readers must know the playwright&#39;s name when  looking for a specific play.         Dubois, William R.

Hall, 1973    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 D85   Prompt books and production editions of plays are valuable resources to  theatre historians because they often contain notes that illuminate  historical practices in staging and production. This work catalogs more  than 2,000 promptbooks and prompter&#39;s editions of plays that form a  collection held by the Northern Illinois Univ. Library. The plays were  produced on the American and English stage between 1775 and 1900, and  these books were used and annotated by directors and actors of those  productions. Entries are arranged alphabetically by playwright. Each  entry includes a physical description of the promptbook, a description  of its covers and any handwritten marks in the text, the date of the  earliest recorded New York or London production, and references to  secondary sources. Indexes provide additional access by play titles and  names of persons mentioned in the text.         Ellis, James ed. English Drama of the Nineteenth Century: an index and finding guide . New Canaan, CT: Readex Books, 1985.    Bobst Ref1 Z2014.D7 E42 1985 c.1   This single alphabetical listing by author and title of approximately  9,000 plays constitutes a substantial bibliography of  nineteenth-century English drama. Its primary purpose, however is as an  index and finding guide to the English plays issued through 1981 in the  Readex Microprint Collection English and American Drama of the  Nineteenth Century. It ranges far beyond the drama proper to include  children&#39;s plays, pantomime books of words, minstrel dialogues, solo  entertainments, opera libretti and vocal scores, and translations of  Continental dramatists from Aeschylus to Ibsen. The earlier English  dramatists, most particularly Shakespeare, are well represented in  collected series of the standard repertory and in acting editions  citing nineteenth-century casts and reflecting stage productions from  the time of Sarah Siddons and John Philip Kemble to that of Henry  Irving and Ellen Terry.         Hixon, Don L. and Hennessee, Don A. Nineteenth-Century American Drama: a finding guide . Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1977.    Bobst Ref1 PS632.H57   The Readex Corporation&#39;s English and American Drama of the 19th Century  microprint collection is a monumental work, containing thousands of  plays. It is located in the Microprint section of Bobst on the A Level.  Because of the difficulty of access, Hixon and Hennessee created an  index to part of the collection entitled &quot;American Plays, 1831-1900&quot;.  That section includes 4,500 plays. Authors and titles are arranged  alphabetically with all titles cross-referenced to authors. Because  Readex classified some plays under their adapters&#39; names instead of  their authors (for instance Shakespeare&#39;s works are listed under  various adaptors&#39; names), Hixon and Hennessee provide cross-references.  Appendices include one for series of plays, an ethnic/racial cast index  and a subject/form index. This last section locates children&#39;s plays,  minstrel plays, temperance plays, and so forth.         Litto, Fredric M. American Dissertations on the Drama and the Theatre: a bibliography .

Although access is  provided by author, sufficient and keyword-in-context indexes, the  actual bibliography is arranged by a computer-generated reference mode.  Each entry lists the author and title of the dissertation along with  university and department names, degree granted, and date. Since this  work stops at 1965, one must use Dissertation Abstracts International  and the lists published annually in Theatre Journal (formerly  Educational Theatre Journal) to find more recent theses.         Pence, James Harry. The Magazine and the Drama: An index . (Theatre and Drama Series, 12) New York: Burt Franklin, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z5781 P43 1970   An early attempt to index theatre articles in the periodical  literature, Pence&#39;s work locates articles about &quot;acted drama&quot; in 166  nineteenth-century magazines. These include Blackwood&#39;s, Godey&#39;s,  Lippincott&#39;s, McClure&#39;s, and the Spectator as well as other lesser  known titles. Although Pence does not state the years he has indexed  they appear to be from around 1872 to 1896. Subjects and authors appear  in one alphabet, and citations list periodical, volume, beginning page,  and (sometimes) date. The most reliable indexing is by personal name,  but one can find information on topics such as &quot;voice, culture of&quot; and  &quot;German stage.&quot; The usefulness of this volume depends in part on the  availability of nineteenth-century periodicals.         Stratman, Carl Joseph. American Theatrical Periodicals, 1789-1967 . Durham, NC Duke Univ. Press, 1970.    Bobst Ref1 Z6935.S75   Stratman has listed in chronological order all known theatrical  periodicals published in the United States to 1967. Although he found  685 titles, he warned that this first effort was likely incomplete.  Entries list bibliographic citations and holdings in several American  libraries. Using the index, readers can locate periodical titles,  editors, cities of publication, organizations sponsoring periodicals  and some keywords-in-the-title terms such as &quot;ballet,&quot; &quot;dance,&quot; or  &quot;repertory.&quot; Stratman explains the use of the bibliography and index in  a clearly written introduction.

So that the reader can consider the leading  players in relation to their supporting actors, Mullin includes reviews  of both stars and unknowns. For both he selects criticism of the actors  abilities in general and criticism of their performance of specific  roles. Critics quoted include George Bernard Shaw, Otis Skinner, and  William Winter, the &quot;doyen of New York theatre critics.&quot; Entries are  arranged alphabetically and include the actor&#39;s dates and nationality.  Excerpts are arranged chronologically. Full bibliographic information  for each citation in the bibliography is included. A subject index  completes the volume.         Odell, George C.D.

Each entry,  when appropriate, includes a very brief bibliography. A guide to  Vaudeville research resources available in libraries is also included.         Wilmeth, Don B. and Miller, Tice L. Cambridge Guide to American Theatre . Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993.    Bobst Ref1 PN2220.C35 1993   This Cambridge work rivals the Oxford Companion the American Theatre in  its ability to provide short, factual answers to questions about the  world of American theatre. Eighty writers, including many of the  best-known theatre historians, inform readers about all subjects  related to the Theatre and to vaudeville, burlesque, the circus, magic,  and film festivals. Cambridge is more inclusive than Oxford whose scope  includes only legitimate theatre. Cambridge also does a better job with  the histories of major American cities such as Baltimore and  Philadelphia. Oxford, however, provides many more entries for  individual plays and persons. Cambridge includes a bibliography written  by Wilmeth and a introductory historical survey. At the moment,  Cambridge is more up-to-date than Oxford, but that advantage will  alternate as additional editions are issued.         Young, William C.

All first-year students must register for this course.  Course Description: Part II of the required introductory course sequence begins with the independence era. Students learn about contending paradigms of sovereignty, patrimony, liberalism, citizenship, and development. The course explores continuing problems of inequality and the impact of pressure by other countries and international organizations on political and economic arrangements in the region. Alongside such issues, students are introduced to expressive culture and the arts, to competing paradigms of formal and commemorative memory and history, and to the emergence of tourism and the UNESCO-associated \u201cculture industry.\u201d The course ends with in-depth analysis of the impact of globalization, neoliberal policies, emerging social movements, increased political participation and decentralization of governance, and the rise of populist governments.

In addition to offering a public lecture, guest scholars, artists, or activists visit the seminar, giving students access to leading thinkers in the field. Course Description: The culture and history of the Caribbean islands will be at the center of this interdisciplinary colloquium. The class will be organized around key moments of Caribbean history: slavery and the struggles against it, colonialism and independence movements, U.S. occupations, dictatorships, and revolutionary movements, the massive growth of a Caribbean diaspora, and the transformation of the Caribbean islands into so many tourist destinations. We will work with both literary texts and primary sources; we will also study some of the most influential approaches to the Caribbean in cultural studies, anthropology, and history.    Back to top    Seminars     LATC-GA 1014 \u2014 Tpcs: Sociology of the Image: Orality, Performance, and the Gaze in the Andes Day/Time: Wednesday, 9:30am - 12:00pm Prof. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Visiting Andres Bello Chair of Latin American Literature and Culture Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description:    Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui is a Bolivian sociologist, historian, activist, filmmaker, and public intellectual of Aymara descent. Founding Director of the Andean Oral History Workshop, she is a leading scholar of postcolonialtiy and indigeneity in the Andes. She published the classic, Oppressed but Not Defeated: Peasant Struggles Among the Aymara and Quechua in Bolivia, 1910-1980, and numerous essays on subaltern critiques of neoliberalism. A Professor emeritus of Sociology a the Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz, she has lectured widely throughout the hemisphere.   Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui proposes a new approach to decolonizing practice. \"Sociology of the Image\" refers to a teaching and research methodology developed at the University of La Paz, focused on bilingual Aymara students' daily experiences at the university and at home, and the historical memories of their families. The goal is to guide them to pertinent sociological and political research and action, to overcome the ventriloquist quality of the social sciences, and to develop a more autonomous relation with the Euro-North American conceptual world. Her work engages visual art and photography as well as film, and is designed to challenge inherited knowledge and produce an alternative view of colonial iconography and popular religiosity. The course will be taught in English, with some readings in Spanish.    LATC-GA 1017 - Government &amp; Politics of Latin America Day/Time: Tuesday, 5:00pm - 7:00pm Prof. Patricio Navia Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: As a social science, political science differs from other disciplines in that its basic object of study is the State and the way individuals and groups of individuals relate, interact and respond to the State. Political parties, institutions and collective behavior of individuals are central components in the field. Thus, political science will often focus more on political parties, the military, government bureaucracies and revolutionary forces than on labor unions, peasants or disposed groups. In short, political science tends to show a bias towards elite studies. Perhaps as a signal that traditionally disposed groups are acquiring greater political power, non-elite studies have grown and enriched the field in recent years. Yet, the primary research focus continues to be the State and how different groups influence (or seek to influence) the State.    LATC-GA 1020 \u2013 Tpcs: Political Paradigms in Action: The Social Dynamics of Citizenship in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean Day/Time: Wednesday, 5:00pm - 7:30pm Prof. Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: This seminar will critically approach three paradigms that have shaped the construction of the nation-state and the emergence of citizenships in Latin America and the Caribbean: the Enlightenment, Emancipation and Multiculturalism. These intersecting political paradigms have been more clearly articulated by privileged individuals such as Bol\u00edvar, Mart\u00ed or Freyre. However, we will study the social processes behind these paradigms, highlighting the role, challenges and contradictions of collective action, and the interplay between political discourse and everyday life experiences. This seminar will examine citizenship not merely as a political category but as a dynamic social process of political belonging. Students will read bibliography regarding different but interconnected places such as Brazil, Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, and even intensely Caribbean New Orleans.    LATC-GA 1048 \u2013 International Human Rights in Latin America Day/Time: Thursday, 6:00pm-9:00pm Prof. Peter Lucas Location: KJCC Room 404W Course Syllabus Course Description: In this graduate seminar, students will study the international human rights standards and principals, topical case studies in Latin America, the role of international and local NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the human rights movement, popular resistance and social movements in the Latin American human rights movement, and the role of media and representation in reporting and promoting human rights.    LATC-GA 2030 Tpcs: Ethnographic Methods in Latin American and Caribbean Studies  Day/Time: Tuesday, 2:00pm - 4:00pm Prof. Katherine Smith Location: KJCC 404W Course Description: This course will introduce students to ethnographic methods, offer an overview of different types of ethnography, and reflect critically on the practice of ethnography. Through a series of fieldwork exercises and readings students will learn practical skills related to fieldwork, such as note-taking and interviewing. The course readings will also survey different ethnographic perspectives--such as feminist ethnography, thick description, visual ethnography, and historical ethnography--each of which engenders certain critiques of the limits of qualitative research and empiricism.       Back to top    Languages  LATC-GA 10 - Beginning Quechua I [Same as: SPAN-UA 81] Day/Time: MTR, 9:30am - 10:45am Prof. Odi Gonzales Location: 25 W4-C17 Course Syllabus Course Description: Quechua is the most important and most widely distributed indigenous language in South America, with about 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia (where the language is called Ingano), Ecuador (where it is called kichwa or runa shimi, \"human speech\"), Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina (where it is usually spelled Quechua and called, by its speakers, runa simi). Studying Quechua opens a window onto alternative ways of thinking about social worlds, about space and time, family, and humans' relationship with the natural world. Quechua is recommended for students anticipating travel to the Andean region, those interested in language and linguistics, and those interested in indigenous literatures and cultures. Students who satisfactorily complete introductory Quechua will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

LATC-GA 3050 - Internship Seminar Day/Time: TBD Prof: Pamela Calla Location: TBD    Back to top    Courses of Interest Offered in Other Departments at NYU    ANTH-GA 3392 \u2014 Colonialism, Nationalism, Modernity: Indians and Indigeneity in the Rural and Urban Andes Day/Time: Wednesday, 5:00pm - 7:30pm Prof. Thomas Abercrombie Location: TBA Course Description: This seminar queries the invention, colonial construction, nationalist problematics, and scholarly reproduction (in history and anthropology), of distinctions among the lived categories of \"Spanish/white,\" mestizo, cholo, and \"indian\" in the countryside and cities of the Andean region (present day Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile). The course begins with a survey of Andean ethnohistory, the interdiscipline that supplements archaeology to \"reconstruct\" indigenous societies prior to the 1532 Spanish invasion through written evidence. It then examines in depth the colonizing and state practices of surveillance and control, and the intellectual pursuits of folklore and anthropology, through which \"indigeneity\" has been produced and sustained in these settler societies to generate the \"modernity\" of the region's non-indigenous inhabitants (and of a succession of imperial metropoles) from the colonial through republican eras to the present. Tracking the succession of key concepts of difference through which social hierarchy has been policed (from 16th-century \"naci\u00f3n\" to 19th-century \"decencia\" to 20th-century \"raza,\" \"etnicidad,\" and \"cultura\"), the seminar considers the longevity of coloniality as well as moments of attempted decolonization. We compare such processes in Andean territory with those of other settler colonies (and with \"non-Andean\" parts of the Andean countries) to ask what differences resulted from the \"Inca-region\" proclivity for rule of large polities by hereditary aristocracy and the state-friendly inclination to provide tribute and labor service, and the long term impact of colonial rule of such polities through Christian confraternal practices, the assignment of collective property rights, and local government via elected councils of commoners, both in rural \"indigenous\" towns and in urban indian parish/neighborhoods. Along with claims about indigenous collectivism, reciprocity, and \"different\" experience of space-time, we particularly question the construal of indigeneity (by colonizers, nation-states, oligarchs, anthropologists, and tourists) via assertions of ontological difference (\"non-Western\" boundaries among persons, things, animals, and \"natural forces\").    ECON-GA 1605 \u2014 Latin American Economics Day/Time: Wednesday, 4:00pm - 6:00pm Prof. Ernest Brown Location: 19W4 736 Course Description: Provides an understanding of economic relationships in the Latin American-Caribbean region through an examination of the leading issues and key problems that these countries face in developing and modernizing their economies. Topics include a brief historical outline; a comparison of heterodox Latin American economic thought to neoclassical theories of growth and development; external equilibrium; foreign trade, balance of payments, exchange rates, foreign investments, and external debt.    HIST-GA 1800 \u2014 Topics in Latin America: Latin America &amp; the US in Transnational Perspective Day/Time: Tuesday, 9:30am - 12:15pm Prof. Gregory Grandin Location: TBA    SPAN-GA 2967 \u2014 Special Topics: Pacific Designs: Orientalism/Trans/Modern Mexico Day/Time: Thursday, 4:00pm - 6:00pm Prof. Laura Torres Rodriguez Location: TBA   Courses at Columbia University  The following courses are courses from Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public affairs (SIPA) and are open to all NYU graduate students.

LATC-GA 2532 - Tinker Colloquium I: Slavery, Race, and Social Identities: The Case of Brazil in Atlantic Perspective [History GXXX] Day/Time: TBA Prof. Hebe Mattos Location: TBA Course Description: The seminar examines how social identities and racial categories have been historically related in Brazil and the process by which they were constructed during the slave period and in the aftermath of abolition.    LATC-GA 2535 \u2013 Remapping Citizenship in 19th Century Mexico (4 points) [LCRS G6260] Day/Time: Wednesday, 2:10pm - 4:00pm Prof. Frida Osorio Location: (CU) 802 IAB Course Description: This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore the relationship between individuals and the emerging national Mexican state. Assuming that the state is not an abstract entity that stands above a mass of equal individuals, but a dynamic space where there is a continuous adjustment and bargaining between them, the main aim is to enable students to observe how the formation of the Mexican national state was a process in which different groups, including subalterns, had an active role. Examining issues of sovereignty, representation, pronunciamientos, federalism, justice, racial and ethnic relations, sex and gender, among others, two interrelated topics will be studied: the ways that society and the state were conceived by political elites and how responses given by majorities to the elite\u2019s political projects affected Mexican political life. We also will be mindful of how state formation was a multilateral process where institutions were constructed, negotiated and contested by a myriad of social actors.    LATC-GA 2536 \u2013 Bodies and Populations in Latin American History [History G9663] Day/Time: Wednesday, 11:00pm-12:50pm Prof. Nara Milanich Location: TBA Course Description: Examines colonial and modern Latin American history through a focus on biopolitics. In addition to transversal themes of gender, sexuality, and race, considers a range of thematic topics including slavery, discipline and punishment, labor and migration, identification practices, criminality, eugenics, demography, citizenship, reproduction, and public health.    LATC-GA 2537 \u2013 Art and Late Capitalism in Latin America [Spanish G6475] Day/Time: Thursday, 1:10pm-4:00pm Prof. Karen Benezra Location: TBA Course Description: This course will examine the ways in which visual art and art theory thought the emergence of post-industrial capitalism in Latin America. Beginning in the 1960s, the so-called dematerialization of art transformed the field of artistic and theoretical production into a fertile ground for posing questions about art\u2019s autonomy from both culture and the social relations of production. We will explore the ways in which artists, critics and theorists revisited issues such as the definition and necessity of the avant-garde, the socialization of art and labor, the historical inheritance of artistic and gremial collectivism and the relationship between art and ideology in light of the social, historic and psychic changes wrought by the emergence of a new phase of capitalist production. In attempting to historicize art\u2019s dematerialization, the course also seeks to raise broader questions about the periodization and contradictory articulation of late capitalism and its social effects in the global periphery.

Representations of Women ENGL-UA 755 Identical to SCA-UA 734. Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every other year. 4 points. Broadly speaking, feminist theory and studies have been concerned with three central problems or issues: (1) describing the organization of power differences between men and women, (2) explaining the \u201corigins\u201d of sexual and gender difference, and (3) accounting for differences among women (and among men) that complicate notions of sexual and gender difference. This course surveys representations of sexual and gender difference in literary and cultural production, focusing especially on texts authored by women. Students consider theories of gender and sexuality that enable us to consider how literature depicts and engages social relations and, conversely, how our reading practices enact (or transform) social conventions regarding gender difference.
