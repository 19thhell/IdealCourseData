Expand All   Collapse All          Anthropology        Anthropology is the comparative study of humankind. Most anthropologists agree that the discipline is divided into four fields: cultural anthropology, which deals with the description and the analysis of culture; physical or biological anthropology, which explores human evolution and variation; linguistic anthropology, which focuses on the relationships between language and culture; and archaeology, which examines the material remains of past cultures.   If you are interested in going to law school; pursuing graduate study; or beginning or advancing a career in international fields, business, government, public policy, education, or market research, the anthropology concentration provides an excellent foundation.           Foundation Courses by Concentration         20 Credits . Prior to beginning this concentration, students must complete the following foundation course and select three additional social sciences foundation courses and one additional humanities foundation course .

The history concentration encourages exploration of the human condition in a manner that is both deep chronologically\u2014looking back to the ancient and pre-modern periods\u2014and broad in approach. You examine the human experience from a variety of perspectives\u2014politically, socially, ideologically, and culturally\u2014on a global scale. You also learn to develop and to utilize the skills critical to navigating today's world, including assessing evidence, evaluating arguments, and understanding how to synthesize various types of information. The curriculum encourages you to go beyond the more common aspects of history and to delve into how individuals, families, and societies construct different versions of the past. So, you explore not only the past, but also how the past becomes history.   The study of history prepares people for a wide variety of professions where critical thinking, analytical skills, and the ability to synthesize information are necessary. Graduates of our program have entered a broad array of fields, including law, education, communication, fine arts, theater and film, and national security. Some have started their own businesses, while others have gone on to graduate studies.             Foundation Courses by Concentration           20 credits .

The concentration in media studies is designed to provide you with the critical knowledge and analytical skills necessary to understand and examine contemporary global media. By investigating the social, cultural, political, and economic forces that shape and are shaped by the media, you also explore the role that the media play in constructing identities and worldviews.   Grounded in the liberal arts, the concentration in media studies provides a solid theoretical foundation to prepare you for future scholarly pursuits and, at the same time, it fosters the versatility, creativity, and social engagement to help you excel in your chosen professional field. Some of our graduates have entered careers in media production (film, television, and new media), marketing, advertising, public relations, media research, and media advocacy, as well as the field of education. Others have pursued graduate degrees in media, communications, journalism, sociology, and cultural studies.         Foundation Courses by Concentration         20 credits .
