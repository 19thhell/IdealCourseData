We kick off the year with Welcome Week, and then plan an ongoing calendar of socials, outings, and workshops. The major events listed here are only a few of the programs for commuters. Be sure to check the Commuter Events Calendar on the Commuter Services homepage for details on these and all upcoming commuter events.     Commuter Overnight Retreat   The Commuter Overnight Retreat is a program to welcome incoming first-year and transfer undergraduate commuter students to the NYU community. It will provide the students an opportunity to learn more about services and organizations for commuter students including the Commuter Student Council and the Commuter Assistant program. They will also meet their first-year commuter peers, have a reception at their respective schools, and engage in community building activities within NYU and New York City.   Commuter Student Welcome   The first commuter event of each academic year is our annual Commuter Welcome, on the first day of Welcome Week. This is a mandatory program for new commuter students. At the Welcome they will meet the Commuter &amp; Off-Campus Student Programs staff, their Commuter Assistant, get to know other new students, and learn about important commuter resources. They will also receive their tickets to The Presidential Welcome &amp; Reality Show at The Beacon Theater. It's a lot of fun and often said by students to be one of the most memorable days of their first year at NYU.     Commuter Student Council Programs     Commuter Student Council , the student elected government for the commuter population, both advocates and creates programs to enhance the quality of life for commuters at NYU. Check out their website to learn more about CSC.     Breakfast for Dinner   At the end of each semester, the Student Resource Center sponsors an evening of pancakes, bacon, and OJ, and commuter students are invited to take a break from studying and eat Breakfast for Dinner (for free)!   Commuter Appreciation Week   Commuter Appreciation Week is a week of events recognizing commuter students during the spring semester. Students from the Commuter Student Council create, organize and run these amazing events throughout the week.
