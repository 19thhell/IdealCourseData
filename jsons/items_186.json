A gateway to all majors offered by the  Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA). It focuses on the  core concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA:  Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies,  Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan  Studies.

Approaches to American Studies SCA-UA 201 Offered every year. 4 points. Offers a survey of American studies as  a dynamic field of scholarship. Using a schedule of keywords, the  course engages key themes and concerns, including war\u2019s role in  social and political development, the meaning of borders, the  politics of entertainment, public interest in private affairs, and  the interplay of goods and labor in shaping national (and  transnational) conditions of fulfillment and dignity. It is intended  to serve as a gateway to lines of inquiry and analysis currently  animating interdisciplinary study of \u201cAmerica\u201d; as an opportunity  to relate current debates to respective historical contexts; and as  an occasion to interrogate presumptions of the United States\u2019  exceptionality, at a time when its interrelation with broader worlds  becomes ever more clear.

The  internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview  and permission of the director of internships. Majors are required to  take the internship program for 4 points but may choose to register  for 8 points. Majors who choose to take the internship for 8 points  count the additional 4 internship credits as an elective.      ELECTIVE COURSES          Comparative U.S. Ethnic Studies SCA-UA 224 Offered every fifth  semester. 4 points. Serves as an introduction to the  interdisciplinary study of race and ethnicity in the United States  and to the range of identities and issues inherent in American  culture. No previous knowledge of ethnic studies is presumed, but the  goal of the class is to create a framework for thoughtful discussion  and analysis of race and ethnicity for students to use long after the  completion of the class.          Intersections: Gender, Race, and  Sexuality in U.S. History and Politics SCA-UA 230 Can be substituted for  Approaches to American Studies (SCA-UA 201). Offered every year. 4  points. Draws on the histories of African,  Asian, European, Latino, and Native Americans of many genders and  sexualities to explore the complex and important intersection of  gender, race, and sexuality in the United States from the 17th  century through the 20th, in historically related case studies.  Starting in the period of European imperialism in the Americas,  examines the ways that gender, race, and sexuality shaped cultural  and political policies and debates surrounding the Salem witch  trials; slavery, abolition, and lynching; U.S. imperialism in Puerto  Rico and Hawaii; the politics of welfare and reproduction; cultural  constructions of manliness, masculinity, and citizenship; and  responses to the AIDS pandemic in a global context.            Ethnicity and the Media SCA-UA 232 Offered every other year. 4  points. Examines media images in relation to  the making of ethnic and racial identities in the United States.  Surveys some of the theoretical approaches to the study of images,  paying particular attention to the intersection of history and  ideologies or representation. Looks into the nature and politics of  stereotypes; inquires into their reproduction through discourses,  representations, and practices; and then moves to a comparative  examination of media images in relation to the making of African  American, Asian, Latino, and Native American images in the media,  looking specifically at changes and continuities in the  representation of these four minority groups in the media.          Cultures and Economies SCA-UA 234   Prerequisite: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1) or  Intersections: Gender, Race, and Sexuality in U.S. History and  Politics (SCA-UA 230). Offered every spring. 4 points. This upper-level seminar focuses on the  relationship between the \u201cthe economy\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d in the  contemporary United States. Though political analysts and scholars  have often treated economic issues and cultural politics and policies  as if they were separate and independent areas for public discussion  and debate, in this course we focus on their interrelatedness and  mutual dependence\u2014on the cultural construction of \u201cthe economy\u201d  and the economic basis for cultural practices and policies. We  examine the historical shift during the 20th century from the rise of  corporate capitalism, through the depression and the New Deal, to the  rise and challenges of neoliberal policy shifts, financialization,  and accelerated globalization since the 1970s. We focus particularly  on the dynamics of \u201ccrisis,\u201d both as an economic and as a  cultural phenomenon.          Marxist Cultural Theory SCA-UA 240 Offered every other year. 4  points. This  course is meant to familiarize students with key concepts in Marxist  cultural theory so that they might (1) begin to appreciate how  extensively Marxist thought informs contemporary scholarly criticism,  and (2) start to use elements of that thought in their own analytical  work. We study founding texts in the Marxist critical tradition;  review Marxist-oriented analyses of literary, musical, and visual  productions; and, finally, consider recent work on the import of  culture as lived experience. Students should ultimately emerge not  only with enhanced critical skills, but also with a deepened  understanding of the significance of culture ,  broadly conceived.          Studies in Popular Culture SCA-UA 251 Prerequisite: Approaches to  American Studies (SCA-UA 201), Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200),  or permission of the instructor. Offered every other year. 4 points. Introduces students to the serious  study of contemporary popular culture as it is manifested in several  overlapping mass-media formations. More specifically, the course  considers the distinct but interrelated functions of various  mass-cultural modes (for example, popular music, cinema, television)  within an increasingly conglomerated entertainment industry that  targets increasingly diversified audience constituencies. Through a  highly selective case-study approach, students are quickly  familiarized with the specific critical considerations demanded by  each form under review. In-depth attention is given to particular  genres characteristic of each medium and to the linkages among the  different media in their joint constitution of a generalized  contemporary mass culture.          Topics in American Studies SCA-UA 280 Offered every year. 4  points. In-depth study of a particular problem  or research area within American studies. See course schedule for  current topic. Nationalism and Development in U.S. Literature, 1850 to 1950 SCA-UA 568 Offered every three years. 4 points. This class is designed primarily as a survey of U.S. literature from 1850 to 1950. The themes of the course are nationalism and development, and thus we focus on those themes in the assigned novels. These novels are chosen because they foreground U.S. slavery, western expansion, industrialization, and imperialist adventure as modes of primitive accumulation that contributed to the foundation of the United States as a \u201cdeveloped\u201d nation. The authors offer anti-imperialist, feminist, and minoritarian critiques of this history of U.S. national development. The course celebrates this oft-ignored tradition in U.S. literature.
