His wife's search for her cultural roots and self-actualization causes the policeman to question his own beliefs and values.                         O Tamaiti                  (directed by Sima Urale, New Zealand, 1996, 15 min)                 O Tamaiti portrays the impressions of a young boy in a powerless, adult-dominated world. Seen through the eyes of 11 year-old Tino, the eldest of five children in a Samoan family in New Zealand, the film opens with the birth of yet another baby. Tino must cope with the added pressures and responsibilities expected of him as the eldest. With mother and father figures who are heard, but not seen, the family struggles with mundane jobs, changing social values, and financial pressures as new immigrants.                         Matou Uma                  (directed by Justine Simei-Barton, New Zealand, 1999, 25 min)                 Matou Uma is a fictional portrayal of a Polynesian, working-class, young women's netball team in Auckland, the city with the largest Pacific Islander population in New Zealand.                         The Overstayer                  (directed by Justine Simei-Barton, New Zealand, 1999, 25 min)                 The Overstayer is a drama based on the \"dawn raids\" in Auckland, New Zealand during the early 1970s, a period of anti-immigration hysteria. Called \"overstayers,\" Pacific Islander immigrants to New Zealand who had not obtained work permits or visas were subjected to random checks (dawn raids) and deportation by immigration officials.                           Matou Uma  and  The Overstayer  were produced by Tala Pasifika with funding by NZ On Air and aired on New Zealand public television (TV One).                                            tues .oct.23.2001                                         FILM SCREENINGS         War or Peace? | 6:00 - 7:30 PM                 Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Jurow Lecture Hall, 101A                 (entrance on Washington Place)                         The Feathers of Peace                  (directed by Barry Barclay, New Zealand, 2000, 85 min)                 The Feathers of Peace reveals the secret shared by Maori and Pakeha (whites) for more than two centuries: the destruction of the Morimori race. This film traces the impact that both races had on the indigenous Morimori of the Chatham Islands. Morimori were a peaceful people who, at the behest of their chief Nunuku, vowed never to take up arms against another human being. Morimori men wore white feathers in their beards to denote their peaceful intent. The film uses the techniques of modern television news as well as dramatized documentary as historical participants tell their own stories through a series of intercut interviews. The narrative and dialogue were taken from the oral histories of Morimori, Maori and colonial records.                                        wed .oct.24.2001                                         FILM SCREENINGS         Pacific Women from New York to New Zealand | 6:00 - 7:30 PM                                 Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Jurow Lecture Hall, 101A                 (entrance on Washington Place)                         Aunty Betty                  (directed by Adria L. Imada, United States, 2000, 22 min)                 Betty Puanani Makia, affectionately known as \"Aunty Betty,\" is a part-Chinese, part-Hawaiian lady who has proudly made New York City her home since 1938. As a professional hula dancer in the 1940s and 50s, Aunty Betty entertained in popular New York City floorshows and on national television. Eighty-five year-old Aunty Betty is hard at work at the Pluck U. restaurant, grilling chicken and joking with her Latino and Bangladeshi co-workers. This documentary explores Aunty Betty's glamorous hula past and her independent life as a \"chicken lady\" in New York City.                         Brown Sugar                  (directed by Justine Simei-Barton, New Zealand, 1995, 10 min)                 Brown Sugar is a story of three young Polynesian girls, confident in their identities, who are about to get their first big break on a TV commercial.                         Velvet Dreams                  (directed by Sima Urale, New Zealand, 1997, 46 min)                 In this witty docudrama shot in Tahiti, Australia, Seattle and New Zealand, a male narrator embarks on a quest to find a Pacific Island woman he spies in a black velvet painting; a 1970s kitsch obsession. Along his journey, the narrator encounters white male painters, former models, and contemporary collectors of tiki art. Urale plays with the consumption and circulation of the eroticized Pacific Island woman, a powerful fixation in the Western world since the \"discovery\" of the Pacific Islands.                                                                                 thurs .oct.25.2001                                  SYMPOSIUM OPENING EVENT | 5:30 - 7:00 PM                 Exhibition Viewing & Reception                 Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program & Institute, 269 Mercer Street, Suite 609                        Art and video by Samoans in Amelika (America) on hybridity, sexuality and diaspora               Featuring artists Jewel Castro and Dan Taulapapa McMullin                            JEWEL CASTRO is a visual artist who creates paintings and multimedia installations about Samoan identity and history. Much of Castro's work is large scale and her paintings are constructed to stand alone or to become part of an installation. While the subjects of Castro's work deal specifically with the Samoan experience, her method of visual storytelling is reminiscent of artists such as Faith Ringgold. Her images are strongly influenced by the dualities of her domestic environment, as well as by her extensive travel throughout the Southwest and her collaborations with Chicano border artists. The colors and forms present in Castro's paintings are informed by both her Samoan heritage and her interest in Mexican muralists, Chicano art and Native American aesthetics.                      DAN TAULAPAPA McMULLIN is a queer Samoan artist living in California and Samoa. He studied conceptual art at California Arts School for a couple years before pursuing an eclectic career decorated with awards, including a Los Angeles area Emmy Award for cable photojournalism. Since 1993, he has worked as an artist, using various media to explore and create narrative and collaborative works. Sinalela is a hybrid of the Samoan Sina story and the Euro-Afro-Asian Cinderella story. Sina, in Samoa, has been the heroine of a vast number of stories and songs. As Hina, Sina or Ina, she is as prominent or more prominent than Maui in the stories of Polynesia. Often her stories are about the soul-seeking and resurrection of a deceased lover. Sometimes with the help of an old woman she raises the young man from the dead.                                                                                      fri .oct.26.2001                                  Coffee & Registration | 8:30 - 9:00 AM         Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                  Welcome & Introductions | 9:00 - 9:30 AM         Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)          PANEL | 9:30 - 11:15 AM                   Identifying the 'Native' in Pacific Studies         Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                 This panel addresses disciplinary and institutional constructions of \"Native\" and \"Pacific\" as the field of Pacific Studies is currently challenged by the politics of indigeneity and Native status.

Through images, stories, and words, she addresses what it means to be a young Tongan American woman, an activist, feminist and educator. In this performance, her paintings are brought to the audience from the isolation of the studio and gallery.                                     Water                  Reading by Dan Taulapapa McMullin                          In the tradition of Po Ula (Glowing Night), McMullin tells an irreverent and unremorseful story of communal consanguinity, erotic turmoil and political shuffling against the background of West Coast Polynesiana.                                   Salt Water Tongue                  Readings by Teresia Teaiwa                          Salt Water Tongue is a compilation of fresh and well-seasoned work by Teresia Teaiwa. The language Teresia uses is simple and spare. The images are drawn from and reflect on being Native, to islands as well as to oceans, the Pacific as well as the Atlantic. In Salt Water Tongue, Teresia will perform her work in English, with some phrases in the Pacific languages of Fijian and Kiribati, and some translations into Spanish. One of her poems, \"Salt Water Feet,\" was written especially for the dance performance of Julia Gray and Katerina Teaiwa.                             Salt Water Feet                  Multi-media dance production by Julia Gray and Katerina Teaiwa                          Salt Water Feet is the intersection of our life journeys. We were raised to dance and move in certain ways, some connected to home and heritage and others to histories and cultures far, far away. Both of us are highly mobile women who travel five or six times a year to visit family and friends across the Pacific. Along these routes we encounter images, music and movement that challenge and sometimes change our identifications. We are very different, however, in our politics, experiences and common mediums of expression. Julia tells stories through dance and song and Katerina through written words. Julia is trained to dance well and Katerina is trained to write well. Katerina, however, wants a space for dance in Pacific Studies beyond entertainment and beyond cultural and historical boundaries. So, what can we learn by working together? What could other people learn?                                                                                                                                   sat .oct.27.2001                                  Coffee | 8:30 - 9:00 AM                       Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                        PANEL | 9:00 - 10:15 AM                        Shifting Currents: Pacific Cultural Productions                  Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Hemmerdinger Hall, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                               This panel aims to introduce contemporary cultural politics in and about the Pacific by exploring contemporary Pacific Islands aesthetics and artistic practices. How do these practices operate in different geographic settings, particularly in diasporic contexts?

His wife's search for her cultural roots and self-actualization causes the policeman to question his own beliefs and values.                         O Tamaiti                  (directed by Sima Urale, New Zealand, 1996, 15 min)                 O Tamaiti portrays the impressions of a young boy in a powerless, adult-dominated world. Seen through the eyes of 11 year-old Tino, the eldest of five children in a Samoan family in New Zealand, the film opens with the birth of yet another baby. Tino must cope with the added pressures and responsibilities expected of him as the eldest. With mother and father figures who are heard, but not seen, the family struggles with mundane jobs, changing social values, and financial pressures as new immigrants.                         Matou Uma                  (directed by Justine Simei-Barton, New Zealand, 1999, 25 min)                 Matou Uma is a fictional portrayal of a Polynesian, working-class, young women's netball team in Auckland, the city with the largest Pacific Islander population in New Zealand.                         The Overstayer                  (directed by Justine Simei-Barton, New Zealand, 1999, 25 min)                 The Overstayer is a drama based on the \"dawn raids\" in Auckland, New Zealand during the early 1970s, a period of anti-immigration hysteria. Called \"overstayers,\" Pacific Islander immigrants to New Zealand who had not obtained work permits or visas were subjected to random checks (dawn raids) and deportation by immigration officials.                           Matou Uma  and  The Overstayer  were produced by Tala Pasifika with funding by NZ On Air and aired on New Zealand public television (TV One).                                            tues .oct.23.2001                                         FILM SCREENINGS         War or Peace? | 6:00 - 7:30 PM                 Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Jurow Lecture Hall, 101A                 (entrance on Washington Place)                         The Feathers of Peace                  (directed by Barry Barclay, New Zealand, 2000, 85 min)                 The Feathers of Peace reveals the secret shared by Maori and Pakeha (whites) for more than two centuries: the destruction of the Morimori race. This film traces the impact that both races had on the indigenous Morimori of the Chatham Islands. Morimori were a peaceful people who, at the behest of their chief Nunuku, vowed never to take up arms against another human being. Morimori men wore white feathers in their beards to denote their peaceful intent. The film uses the techniques of modern television news as well as dramatized documentary as historical participants tell their own stories through a series of intercut interviews. The narrative and dialogue were taken from the oral histories of Morimori, Maori and colonial records.                                        wed .oct.24.2001                                         FILM SCREENINGS         Pacific Women from New York to New Zealand | 6:00 - 7:30 PM                                 Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Jurow Lecture Hall, 101A                 (entrance on Washington Place)                         Aunty Betty                  (directed by Adria L. Imada, United States, 2000, 22 min)                 Betty Puanani Makia, affectionately known as \"Aunty Betty,\" is a part-Chinese, part-Hawaiian lady who has proudly made New York City her home since 1938. As a professional hula dancer in the 1940s and 50s, Aunty Betty entertained in popular New York City floorshows and on national television. Eighty-five year-old Aunty Betty is hard at work at the Pluck U. restaurant, grilling chicken and joking with her Latino and Bangladeshi co-workers. This documentary explores Aunty Betty's glamorous hula past and her independent life as a \"chicken lady\" in New York City.                         Brown Sugar                  (directed by Justine Simei-Barton, New Zealand, 1995, 10 min)                 Brown Sugar is a story of three young Polynesian girls, confident in their identities, who are about to get their first big break on a TV commercial.                         Velvet Dreams                  (directed by Sima Urale, New Zealand, 1997, 46 min)                 In this witty docudrama shot in Tahiti, Australia, Seattle and New Zealand, a male narrator embarks on a quest to find a Pacific Island woman he spies in a black velvet painting; a 1970s kitsch obsession. Along his journey, the narrator encounters white male painters, former models, and contemporary collectors of tiki art. Urale plays with the consumption and circulation of the eroticized Pacific Island woman, a powerful fixation in the Western world since the \"discovery\" of the Pacific Islands.                                                                                 thurs .oct.25.2001                                  SYMPOSIUM OPENING EVENT | 5:30 - 7:00 PM                 Exhibition Viewing & Reception                 Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program & Institute, 269 Mercer Street, Suite 609                        Art and video by Samoans in Amelika (America) on hybridity, sexuality and diaspora               Featuring artists Jewel Castro and Dan Taulapapa McMullin                            JEWEL CASTRO is a visual artist who creates paintings and multimedia installations about Samoan identity and history. Much of Castro's work is large scale and her paintings are constructed to stand alone or to become part of an installation. While the subjects of Castro's work deal specifically with the Samoan experience, her method of visual storytelling is reminiscent of artists such as Faith Ringgold. Her images are strongly influenced by the dualities of her domestic environment, as well as by her extensive travel throughout the Southwest and her collaborations with Chicano border artists. The colors and forms present in Castro's paintings are informed by both her Samoan heritage and her interest in Mexican muralists, Chicano art and Native American aesthetics.                      DAN TAULAPAPA McMULLIN is a queer Samoan artist living in California and Samoa. He studied conceptual art at California Arts School for a couple years before pursuing an eclectic career decorated with awards, including a Los Angeles area Emmy Award for cable photojournalism. Since 1993, he has worked as an artist, using various media to explore and create narrative and collaborative works. Sinalela is a hybrid of the Samoan Sina story and the Euro-Afro-Asian Cinderella story. Sina, in Samoa, has been the heroine of a vast number of stories and songs. As Hina, Sina or Ina, she is as prominent or more prominent than Maui in the stories of Polynesia. Often her stories are about the soul-seeking and resurrection of a deceased lover. Sometimes with the help of an old woman she raises the young man from the dead.                                                                                      fri .oct.26.2001                                  Coffee & Registration | 8:30 - 9:00 AM         Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                  Welcome & Introductions | 9:00 - 9:30 AM         Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)          PANEL | 9:30 - 11:15 AM                   Identifying the 'Native' in Pacific Studies         Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                 This panel addresses disciplinary and institutional constructions of \"Native\" and \"Pacific\" as the field of Pacific Studies is currently challenged by the politics of indigeneity and Native status.

Through images, stories, and words, she addresses what it means to be a young Tongan American woman, an activist, feminist and educator. In this performance, her paintings are brought to the audience from the isolation of the studio and gallery.                                     Water                  Reading by Dan Taulapapa McMullin                          In the tradition of Po Ula (Glowing Night), McMullin tells an irreverent and unremorseful story of communal consanguinity, erotic turmoil and political shuffling against the background of West Coast Polynesiana.                                   Salt Water Tongue                  Readings by Teresia Teaiwa                          Salt Water Tongue is a compilation of fresh and well-seasoned work by Teresia Teaiwa. The language Teresia uses is simple and spare. The images are drawn from and reflect on being Native, to islands as well as to oceans, the Pacific as well as the Atlantic. In Salt Water Tongue, Teresia will perform her work in English, with some phrases in the Pacific languages of Fijian and Kiribati, and some translations into Spanish. One of her poems, \"Salt Water Feet,\" was written especially for the dance performance of Julia Gray and Katerina Teaiwa.                             Salt Water Feet                  Multi-media dance production by Julia Gray and Katerina Teaiwa                          Salt Water Feet is the intersection of our life journeys. We were raised to dance and move in certain ways, some connected to home and heritage and others to histories and cultures far, far away. Both of us are highly mobile women who travel five or six times a year to visit family and friends across the Pacific. Along these routes we encounter images, music and movement that challenge and sometimes change our identifications. We are very different, however, in our politics, experiences and common mediums of expression. Julia tells stories through dance and song and Katerina through written words. Julia is trained to dance well and Katerina is trained to write well. Katerina, however, wants a space for dance in Pacific Studies beyond entertainment and beyond cultural and historical boundaries. So, what can we learn by working together? What could other people learn?                                                                                                                                   sat .oct.27.2001                                  Coffee | 8:30 - 9:00 AM                       Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Silverstein Lounge, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                        PANEL | 9:00 - 10:15 AM                        Shifting Currents: Pacific Cultural Productions                  Main Building, 100 Washington Square East, Hemmerdinger Hall, First Floor         (entrance on Washington Place)                               This panel aims to introduce contemporary cultural politics in and about the Pacific by exploring contemporary Pacific Islands aesthetics and artistic practices. How do these practices operate in different geographic settings, particularly in diasporic contexts? What are some of the challenges facing Pacific Islander artists and critics who frequently cross between several arenas of artistic and intellectual practice?
