COURSE LEARNING GOALS:    1. Course Objectives:   The course covers fundamentals of object oriented systems analysis and design. Topics covered include requirement gathering, system modeling and software specifications.  The major emphasis of this course is on using object-oriented modeling to define system specification.    As part of this course, the student is exposed to object oriented concepts such as objects and classes, attributes and methods, packages, associations, interfaces, generalization and inheritance, and other concepts.  In addition, the class will cover UML (Unified Modeling Language) concepts such as use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, etc. We will look into RUP (Rational Unified Process) and learn the iterative process of OO analysis, design and construction    Information systems development is a process in which technical, organizational and human aspects of a system are analyzed and changed with the goal of creating or improving a system. In spite of the advanced technology that surrounds computer-based information systems, the process of systems analysis and design is still largely an art. This course will give students an understanding of the most common tools, techniques, and theories currently used in object-oriented systems modeling.   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The focus of the course will be on the following topics:     Object Oriented concepts and principles  The importance of good requirement gathering and risk management  Object oriented systems analysis and design  System modeling techniques using UML  Use cases, class diagram, sequence and activity diagrams     2. Student Learning Outcomes:     Distinguish between various system development methodologies  Understand Object Oriented concepts, terms and principles  Develop a project scope, and a project plan with feasibility analysis   Recognize the importance of good requirement gathering and risk management  Gain knowledge of object oriented systems analysis and design techniques and models  Work with and use UML for object oriented modeling  Develop use cases - both diagrams and narratives  Model an overall system using UML class diagrams  Model system functionality using UML sequence and collaboration diagrams  Use cases, class diagram, sequence and activity diagrams  Create a conceptual and a physical ER model for a database to support the system  Understand system architecture in terms of single vs. multi-tier with thick/thin client  Realize and appreciate system operation and ongoing support issues/concerns      COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES:   See [Policies]         BOOKS:     Required Reading & Materials -     Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design (2nd Edition)    Authors - George, Batra, Valacich and Hoffer  Publisher - Pearson/Prentice Hall      Available at Amazon.com, or   You can obtain an e-version of the book at http://www.coursesmart.com/0132279053      Recommended Reading & Materials -      UML for Java Programmers     Author - Robert Martin  Publisher - Pearson            GRADE ASSIGNMENT AND EVALUATION:       Attendance and Participation - 15% (Students must ask questions and engage in class discussions/topics)   Homeworks/Project - 25% (Project - Team members will weigh in on each other's contribution toward the final project)  Midterm Exam - 30%   Final Exam - 30%         Details of Assignment and Evaluation .

COURSE LEARNING GOALS:    1. Course Objectives:   The course covers fundamentals of object oriented systems analysis and design. Topics covered include requirement gathering, system modeling and software specifications.  The major emphasis of this course is on using object-oriented modeling to define system specification.    As part of this course, the student is exposed to object oriented concepts such as objects and classes, attributes and methods, packages, associations, interfaces, generalization and inheritance, and other concepts.  In addition, the class will cover UML (Unified Modeling Language) concepts such as use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, etc. We will look into RUP (Rational Unified Process) and learn the iterative process of OO analysis, design and construction    Information systems development is a process in which technical, organizational and human aspects of a system are analyzed and changed with the goal of creating or improving a system. In spite of the advanced technology that surrounds computer-based information systems, the process of systems analysis and design is still largely an art. This course will give students an understanding of the most common tools, techniques, and theories currently used in object-oriented systems modeling.   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The focus of the course will be on the following topics:     Object Oriented concepts and principles  The importance of good requirement gathering and risk management  Object oriented systems analysis and design  System modeling techniques using UML  Use cases, class diagram, sequence and activity diagrams     2. Student Learning Outcomes:     Distinguish between various system development methodologies  Understand Object Oriented concepts, terms and principles  Develop a project scope, and a project plan with feasibility analysis   Recognize the importance of good requirement gathering and risk management  Gain knowledge of object oriented systems analysis and design techniques and models  Work with and use UML for object oriented modeling  Develop use cases - both diagrams and narratives  Model an overall system using UML class diagrams  Model system functionality using UML sequence and collaboration diagrams  Use cases, class diagram, sequence and activity diagrams  Create a conceptual and a physical ER model for a database to support the system  Understand system architecture in terms of single vs. multi-tier with thick/thin client  Realize and appreciate system operation and ongoing support issues/concerns      COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES:   See [Policies]         BOOKS:     Required Reading & Materials -     Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design (2nd Edition)    Authors - George, Batra, Valacich and Hoffer  Publisher - Pearson/Prentice Hall      Available at Amazon.com, or   You can obtain an e-version of the book at http://www.coursesmart.com/0132279053      Recommended Reading & Materials -      UML for Java Programmers     Author - Robert Martin  Publisher - Pearson            GRADE ASSIGNMENT AND EVALUATION:       Attendance and Participation - 15% (Students must ask questions and engage in class discussions/topics)   Homeworks/Project - 25% (Project - Team members will weigh in on each other's contribution toward the final project)  Midterm Exam - 30%   Final Exam - 30%         Details of Assignment and Evaluation .

COURSE LEARNING GOALS:    1. Course Objectives:   The course covers fundamentals of object oriented systems analysis and design. Topics covered include requirement gathering, system modeling and software specifications.  The major emphasis of this course is on using object-oriented modeling to define system specification.    As part of this course, the student is exposed to object oriented concepts such as objects and classes, attributes and methods, packages, associations, interfaces, generalization and inheritance, and other concepts.  In addition, the class will cover UML (Unified Modeling Language) concepts such as use cases, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, etc. We will look into RUP (Rational Unified Process) and learn the iterative process of OO analysis, design and construction    Information systems development is a process in which technical, organizational and human aspects of a system are analyzed and changed with the goal of creating or improving a system. In spite of the advanced technology that surrounds computer-based information systems, the process of systems analysis and design is still largely an art. This course will give students an understanding of the most common tools, techniques, and theories currently used in object-oriented systems modeling.   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The focus of the course will be on the following topics:     Object Oriented concepts and principles  The importance of good requirement gathering and risk management  Object oriented systems analysis and design  System modeling techniques using UML  Use cases, class diagram, sequence and activity diagrams     2. Student Learning Outcomes:     Distinguish between various system development methodologies  Understand Object Oriented concepts, terms and principles  Develop a project scope, and a project plan with feasibility analysis   Recognize the importance of good requirement gathering and risk management  Gain knowledge of object oriented systems analysis and design techniques and models  Work with and use UML for object oriented modeling  Develop use cases - both diagrams and narratives  Model an overall system using UML class diagrams  Model system functionality using UML sequence and collaboration diagrams  Use cases, class diagram, sequence and activity diagrams  Create a conceptual and a physical ER model for a database to support the system  Understand system architecture in terms of single vs. multi-tier with thick/thin client  Realize and appreciate system operation and ongoing support issues/concerns      COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES:   See [Policies]         BOOKS:     Required Reading & Materials -     Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design (2nd Edition)    Authors - George, Batra, Valacich and Hoffer  Publisher - Pearson/Prentice Hall      Available at Amazon.com, or   You can obtain an e-version of the book at http://www.coursesmart.com/0132279053      Recommended Reading & Materials -      UML for Java Programmers     Author - Robert Martin  Publisher - Pearson            GRADE ASSIGNMENT AND EVALUATION:       Attendance and Participation - 15% (Students must ask questions and engage in class discussions/topics)   Homeworks/Project - 25% (Project - Team members will weigh in on each other's contribution toward the final project)  Midterm Exam - 30%   Final Exam - 30%         Details of Assignment and Evaluation .
