Published by the World Bank Group, the Disease Control Priorities (DCP3) Essential Surgery volume examines new evidence for the unmet need and potential impact of surgery on saving lives in low- and middle-income countries. DCP3 expands on the seminal findings from the second edition (2006) of DCP2 by showing that by providing surgery for road traffic injuries, obstetric emergencies, and common ailments like cataracts, poor countries could gain $10 worth of health benefits for every $1 invested.    \u201cIn Essential Surgery, we have identified 44 essential surgical procedures which should be readily available in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d said volume editor and University of California, San Francisco Professor Haile Debas \u201cMost of these procedures can be performed in first-level hospitals by multidisciplinary teams of surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and other healthcare providers. Investment in first-level hospitals is critical because they are the most important sites for essential surgical care delivery.\u201d   In addition to the volume\u2019s overall review of essential key surgical elements, prevention can reduce the need for surgery.    \u201cIf community health care workers provided comprehensive prevention for caries and periodontitis they could reduce the need for dental surgery by almost 80 percent,\u201d said Dr. Richard Niederman, NYU College of Dentistry professor and chair of Epidemiology and Health Promotion, co-author of DCP3\u2019s dentistry chapter.   DCP3 volume editor and University of Washington Professor of Medicine Dr. Charles Mock hopes the volume will change how surgery is viewed in terms of global health priorities.   \u201cThe essential package addresses the highest priority surgical conditions: those with large health burdens and for which there are surgical procedures that are cost-effective and eminently feasible to provide universally\u201d says Mock. \u201cMoreover, essential surgical procedures are among the most cost-effective of all health interventions, on the same level of cost-effectiveness as immunizations, bed nets, anti-retroviral therapy for HIV, and other interventions that have received wide attention and investment globally. Similar investment in making essential surgery universally available would contribute to significant improvements in health globally.\u201d   The volume will be released at the Consortium of Universities in Global Health conference in Boston, MA . Speakers include volume editors and authors who provided critical leadership throughout the writing and production process. The full series will be comprised of nine individual volumes that will be published in 2015-2016.

The CDC currently supports 37 centers associated with schools of public health or medicine throughout the country, reaching 41 million people in 66 partner communities.   Each center conducts at least one core research project with an underserved population that has a disproportionately large burden of disease and disability. In addition, the centers work with partners on special interest projects. As a result, the PRCs\u2019 portfolio includes hundreds of projects each year.

Published by the World Bank Group, the Disease Control Priorities (DCP3) Essential Surgery volume examines new evidence for the unmet need and potential impact of surgery on saving lives in low- and middle-income countries. DCP3 expands on the seminal findings from the second edition (2006) of DCP2 by showing that by providing surgery for road traffic injuries, obstetric emergencies, and common ailments like cataracts, poor countries could gain $10 worth of health benefits for every $1 invested.    \u201cIn Essential Surgery, we have identified 44 essential surgical procedures which should be readily available in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d said volume editor and University of California, San Francisco Professor Haile Debas \u201cMost of these procedures can be performed in first-level hospitals by multidisciplinary teams of surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses and other healthcare providers. Investment in first-level hospitals is critical because they are the most important sites for essential surgical care delivery.\u201d   In addition to the volume\u2019s overall review of essential key surgical elements, prevention can reduce the need for surgery.    \u201cIf community health care workers provided comprehensive prevention for caries and periodontitis they could reduce the need for dental surgery by almost 80 percent,\u201d said Dr. Richard Niederman, NYU College of Dentistry professor and chair of Epidemiology and Health Promotion, co-author of DCP3\u2019s dentistry chapter.   DCP3 volume editor and University of Washington Professor of Medicine Dr. Charles Mock hopes the volume will change how surgery is viewed in terms of global health priorities.   \u201cThe essential package addresses the highest priority surgical conditions: those with large health burdens and for which there are surgical procedures that are cost-effective and eminently feasible to provide universally\u201d says Mock. \u201cMoreover, essential surgical procedures are among the most cost-effective of all health interventions, on the same level of cost-effectiveness as immunizations, bed nets, anti-retroviral therapy for HIV, and other interventions that have received wide attention and investment globally. Similar investment in making essential surgery universally available would contribute to significant improvements in health globally.\u201d   The volume will be released at the Consortium of Universities in Global Health conference in Boston, MA . Speakers include volume editors and authors who provided critical leadership throughout the writing and production process. The full series will be comprised of nine individual volumes that will be published in 2015-2016.

The CDC currently supports 37 centers associated with schools of public health or medicine throughout the country, reaching 41 million people in 66 partner communities.   Each center conducts at least one core research project with an underserved population that has a disproportionately large burden of disease and disability. In addition, the centers work with partners on special interest projects. As a result, the PRCs\u2019 portfolio includes hundreds of projects each year.
