consists of instrumental pieces from the 17th-century Ottoman court and 19th and 20th-century Cairo and Aleppo, as well as Arabic mystical, folkloric, and popular music. The internationally-known performers also discuss the history of the q\u0101n\u016bn, the historical roots of Arabic rhythms, and fundamental elements of Arabic musical aesthetics going back to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 339/950).

Courts and Performance in the Premodern Middle East               In bringing together leading scholars and performers of the Abbasid, Byzantine, Fatimid, Crusader, Jewish, Persianate, and Ottoman traditions, this conference engages three major themes: the power of patronage to affect and inflect performance modes in comparison with other settings; the ways court performers express emotion and invite emotional response in their audiences; and how performance often blurs the line between oral and written traditions.

consists of instrumental pieces from the 17th-century Ottoman court and 19th and 20th-century Cairo and Aleppo, as well as Arabic mystical, folkloric, and popular music. The internationally-known performers also discuss the history of the q\u0101n\u016bn, the historical roots of Arabic rhythms, and fundamental elements of Arabic musical aesthetics going back to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 339/950).

Courts and Performance in the Premodern Middle East               In bringing together leading scholars and performers of the Abbasid, Byzantine, Fatimid, Crusader, Jewish, Persianate, and Ottoman traditions, this conference engages three major themes: the power of patronage to affect and inflect performance modes in comparison with other settings; the ways court performers express emotion and invite emotional response in their audiences; and how performance often blurs the line between oral and written traditions.

Courts and Performance in the Premodern Middle East               In bringing together leading scholars and performers of the Abbasid, Byzantine, Fatimid, Crusader, Jewish, Persianate, and Ottoman traditions, this conference engages three major themes: the power of patronage to affect and inflect performance modes in comparison with other settings; the ways court performers express emotion and invite emotional response in their audiences; and how performance often blurs the line between oral and written traditions.
