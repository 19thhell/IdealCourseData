The seminar examines the impact of political change, and changes in the burden of disease on community health. Students examine how primary health care is delivered through the South African health care system; the current distribution of infectious and chronic diseases (including HIV, TB, Malaria and various cancers) in South Africa; specific issues related to reproductive health including the implementation of HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs and issues in family planning. The course also examines challenges for health policy and service implementation, associated with the legacy of apartheid as well post-apartheid era developments. After a week of lectures, and field trips, students spend one week shadowing the activities of a community-based social advocacy groups or health NGO's, in order to gain insights into the important role civil society organizations play in community health in South Africa.   Three weeks of the course are spent in Cape Town and include lectures, seminars, and field trips in the Western Cape. During the third week of the course, students travel to rural areas od KwaZulu-Natal, which is the epi-center of HIV in South Africa to learn about research projects concerning HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and other key health issues and examine health care delivery and community health issues from a rural perspective. During this segment of the course those students who choose to, are given the opportunity to stay overnight with a family living in the rural area. At the end of this week most students take a 3 day break to visit a game reserve near where the group has been staying. Back in Cape Town for the final week of the course students work on a presentation on the topic related to the work they were involved in during the second week of the course.

Please click here to view the syllabus.     This course is devoted to flexible forms of inquiry suited to the local context of global public health research. Sometimes known as 'action research', 'rapid assessment, and 'community-based participatory research' these approaches share a commitment to working closely with and in communities to identify health risks and effective interventions for ameliorating them. Although field research may include surveys and other forms of quantitative research, the emphasis in this class will be on qualitative methods with mixed method approaches included where appropriate. The focus will be on introducing the basic content/skills of on-the-ground field research under challenging conditions, i.e., shortages of time and resources as well as cultural/ linguistic differences. There are additional aspects to learning these methods (e.g., data analysis) that require much more time and skill development than is possible in this brief introductory course. Interested students are strongly advised to take additional coursework in qualitative methods.                                                                GPH-GU 2352 \u00a0 \u00a0Comparative Health Systems                                   Spring Semester   4 credits   Prerequisites: GPH-GU 2110; microeconomics recommended   * Cross-listed with HPAM-GP 2852   We tend to be ethnocentric in our views of health care organization and policy. A look abroad, however, can provide insights about problems at home. In spite of differences in the organization and financing of their health care systems, most countries share a number of common problems with the United States. First, is the question of deciding - or not explicitly deciding - what proportion of GNP should be devoted to health and welfare. Second, is the problem of agreeing on appropriate criteria to allocate health and social service expenditures. Third, is the problem of how to implement established policies: through regulation, promotion of competition, budgeting, or reimbursement incentives directed at health care providers. In this class, students will be asked to become \"experts\" about a health system of their choice outside the United States but in a nation belonging to the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Students with a special interest in developing nations and the transitional economies of Central and Eastern Europe may choose to become an expert in a second health system, as well, but all students must choose one relatively wealthy nation that they can compare to the United States. We will examine a range of health systems with respect to their own published data, as well as data collected and analyses conducted by international organizations, e.g. the World Health Organization (WHO), OECD, the World Bank, and UNICEF. The readings, lectures and class discussions will focus on the common problems and themes noted above as they affect the organization and financing of health systems in wealthy OECD nations. We begin with a discussion of the impact of globalization on health system development and an overview of health system models around the world. Second, we examine conceptual frameworks and methods for health systems analysis, and a range of myths about health systems with universal coverage. Third, and this is the heart of the class, we apply these approaches to the empirical analysis of health systems in selected nations and examine the extent to which the available evidence supports or refutes these myths. Throughout the class, we will also consider issues of medicine, culture and public health infrastructure; and the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods of comparative analysis in cross-national research.                                                                                PUHE-GE 2316 Community Health: A Society in Transition (South Africa)                               Explore how political change has affected health care access and policy in South Africa. Immersed in the work of social advocacy groups and health NGOs, you\u2019ll visit rural areas and meet local families, learning about HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs from a rural perspective. In the process, you\u2019ll gain an understanding of the country\u2019s priority regions in reproductive health and infectious diseases.

The emergence of new pathogens and drug resistance, as well as increased transmission opportunities caused by human migration, political instability and breakdown of healthcare infrastructure, has led to a rising prevalence of infectious disease. This course aims to provide training in the biology, epidemiology and control of emerging diseases. It will provide the necessary skills to analyze the interplay between human host and pathogen in both evolutionary ecology and statistical epidemiology frameworks. There will be a discussion of &quot;Darwinian Medicine&quot;. Specific bioterrorism pathogens will be discussed, as well as methods of identification and predictive modeling of a bioterrorism incident. In addition to lectures, class time will include practical data handling. Discussion of both methodological and substantive epidemiology papers from the recent literature will be led by the students.

This advanced course develops a set of analytic skills that are used by some policy analysts. It focuses on impact analysis. The goals of the course are to (a) extend familiarity with methodologic issues, including various study designs, measurement problems, and analytic approaches; (b) provide hands-on experience in management, analysis, and presentation of data; and (c) develop skills in reading, critiquing, and reporting on policy-relevant impact analyses written by others. The emphasis of the course is on learning by doing, through data analysis, data presentation, and study critiquing activities. Students work on developing the ability to convey findings in text and table format.                                                                  GPH-GU 2510 \u00a0 \u00a0Fundamentals of International Dental Public Health Practice                                 Spring Semester   3 credits   Prerequisites: None   Dental, oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders are amongst the most common health problems in all regions of the world. Caries, periodontal infections, orofacial pain, temporomandibular joint diseases (TMD), and salivary gland dysfunction in the form of Sjogren's syndrome, significantly affect the quality of life of people around the world due to their high prevalence and incidence. Some of these conditions are more prevalent in certain countries or regions, while others are found virtually in all countries, but to varying degrees. Other oral health burdens are imposed by a variety of oral diseases and disorders with oral manifestations, such as HIV/AIDS, birth defects, head and face injuries, and head and neck cancers. As oral health is part of total health and is essential to quality of life, the World Health Organization, through international collaborative partnerships, gives priority to integration of oral health with general health programs at community or national levels for oral health promotion and disease prevention. This course will cover several thematic units (basic philosophy, epidemiology of oral diseases, etiologies of oral disease, social and culture risk factors, prevention of oral disease in public health), each of which will include a lecture component and a group discussion component.

Common mental disorders\u2014depression, anxiety, substance abuse\u2014present the largest disabling disease burden for people in the world today\u2014rivaling HIV, TB, or malaria in that respect. They exacerbate risk for, and severity of, medical illness. They are implicated in other social issues such as violence, poverty, and individual and collective efficacy. Yet they tend to get lost on the global health agenda. Why this discrepancy between relevance, and resources? Lack of familiarity with the interventions, measuring challenges, population-based strategies, and disease-language that captures these issues is in part to blame. Public health approaches to common mental disorders are also only recently demonstrating new rigor and maturity. This course provides exposure to this increasingly relevant public health challenge, with a particular focus on low-income country settings and on the implications of mental health issues for global development efforts. It also will challenge students to think critically about the goals of public health more generally with respect to how health outcomes both reflect and further outcomes in other sectors\u2014eg, education outcomes, criminal recidivism, economic and social participation.

This course is based on the premise that a rational and desirable goal for any society is to develop and maintain a food system that promotes health, protects the environment, is sustainable, and supports the livelihoods of its participants.     The course deals with how governments\u2014particularly that of the United States\u2014design and implement policies and programs to foster social goals such as ensuring a sufficient, safe, affordable, and sustainable food supply.&amp;nbsp; It examines why and how governments do or do not decide to set policies; reviews how stakeholders in the food system become involved in and influence policy development; identifies the social, cultural, economic, and political factors that influence stakeholder and government positions on policy issues; and describes the ways in which these factors promote or act as barriers to policies aimed at promoting the health of people and the planet.   COURSE OBJECTIVES     Define what is meant by policy, and explain how policies differ from programs.   Describe the principal areas of domestic and international nutrition, food, and agriculture policy and the most important current issues related to those policy areas.   Identify the government agencies primarily responsible for each area of food and nutrition policy, explain their roles, and describe their principal policy goals and method for achieving them.   Explain what is meant by \u201cfood system,\u201d the issues raised by this term, and the principal stakeholder groups and positions on food system issues.   Identify the ways in which social, cultural, economic, commercial, and institutional factors promote or act as barriers to the design and implementation of agriculture, food, and nutrition policies and programs, and the ways in which these policies and programs affect health.   Identify the principal health\u2013related problems linked to food and nutrition. Explain how these problems, in both U.S. and international populations, may (or may not) be linked to domestic and international food policy.   Identify and apply the methods by which stakeholder groups affect the design and implementation of agriculture, food, and nutrition policies.   Describe arguments that support and counter the position that government should not be involved in the food choices of individuals.
