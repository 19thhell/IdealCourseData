To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

To set the context for future clinical research activities, the NIH convened a Director's Panel in the late 1990s. They recognized the state of clinical research as a national problem and made certain recommendations. These recommendations included improving the quality of clinical research training, initiating training programs to attract students into clinical research careers, and educating the public about the importance of clinical research.   NIH Roadmap clearly identifies that in order to provide 21 st century medicine; we need expanding medical/dental advances. To support such advances, a trained clinical research workforce is needed who will take research from bench-to-bedside or chair side. As of Oct 29, 2014, globally, there were 177,688 clinical trials listed on the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials web site ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). Nearly 46% of these studies were located in the U.S. (over 30,250 of these studies were in the tri-state area). As we need trained clinical research personnel at all levels to conduct these studies using the highest scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards, New York University College of Dentistry initiated a Clinical Research Training Program in 2001. As of May 2013, we have graduated over 150 students from this program who were born in 28 different countries. Among those who have gone through our program were foreign and U.S. trained dentists and physicians, pharmaceutical industry employees, colleague graduates with pharmacy, pharmacology, and other degrees, and even a few students with MS and/or PhD degrees in basic sciences. Our graduates have obtained positions in academia, industry, and government institutes and some others have gone to obtain higher degrees such as MD, DDS, and MPH. In an independent external review of the program conducted by three reviewers (two from academia and one from industry) in 2011, the students and alumni expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the program and the program faculty, which is comprised of both academicians and industry experts.   MISSION OF THE MS PROGRAM     The mission of the NYU College of Dentistry Master of Science (MS) in Clinical Research Program is to produce competent entry-level clinical researchers who are knowledgeable about clinical research methodology, administration, ethics, and governing regulations, with a programmatic emphasis on Randomized Controlled Trials.   GOALS OF THE MS PROGRAM   The major functions of the NYU College of Dentistry MS in Clinical Research Program are education, simulation, and practice and the goals for each function are defined below:                                                  Education                               To educate students about fundamentals of clinical research, clinical research regulations, and the process of constructing research protocols and grant proposals; to develop relevant skills needed for effective practice of clinical research; and, to maintain an environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation.                                                              Simulation                               To contribute to the advancement of clinical research knowledge and experience through simulation with peers, educators, researchers, and research administrators.                                                              Practice                               To provide relevant working experience in clinical research, research administration, and regulatory oversight.                      Academics   We offer two graduate programs in clinical research. The first is a two-year MS program and the second, a one-year Certificate Program .   Eligible applicants for these programs are individuals from academia and industry with backgrounds in dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and other allied health professions or those who possess a minimum of a BA or a BS degree. Tuition for the program is according to the standard per credit tuition fee for the Graduate School of Arts and Science at NYU.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

Perelman Department of Dermatology was structured with the department's mission in mind, and seeks to provide the skills needed to pursue and achieve lifelong learning in dermatology.   \u00a0       Introductory Course for First-Year Residents:   The initial six weeks of the year are dedicated to providing first-year residents with the basic tools they need as dermatology residents. A curriculum of reading centered around some of the more common dermatoses is coordinated with a differential diagno\u00adsis course. The goal is to arm residents with a sound approach to clinical diagnosis. During this time peri\u00adod, second- and third-year residents review recently published CME articles.   \u00a0   Morning Didactic Sessions:   After the first six weeks of the academic year, the first-year residents join the second- and third-year residents for the morning didactic teaching sessions, which include lectures, seminars, and conferences. A committee directs resident didactic education. A core curriculum in medical and pediatric dermatol\u00adogy, dermatologic surgery, dermatopathology, and the basic sciences is supplemented by Journal Club, which is aimed at developing residents\u2019 skills in critical review of the literature. There are also several clinical conferences, during which the translation of academic knowledge into clinical practice is emphasized.   \u00a0   Residents meet daily from 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. for didactic sessions, and twice weekly from 12:15 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. for case-based clinical sessions. All sessions are moderated or led by full- or part-time faculty mem\u00adbers who possess a range of expertise that covers the spectrum of dermatology.   \u00a0   Weekly Didactics Schedule   Monday: Textbook Review   The medical and basic science dermatology curricu\u00adlum is covered in this session, which is resident-run under faculty direction. Residents become \u201cmini-ex\u00adperts\u201d in the topics they review and are provided with a structured framework for their weekly read\u00ading. An interactive format is encouraged, with a focus on synthesis of the material in current major dermatology textbooks, clinical pearls, and pertinent information from the recent literature.   Tuesday: Residents\u2019 Lecture Series   Senior residents invite faculty and other experts to lecture on a range of topics, including dermatologic surgery, pediatric dermatology, and the basic scienc\u00ades. In addition, the medical dermatology curriculum is enhanced through lectures by specialists on a variety of topics and regular case review sessions, in which differential diagnoses and therapeutic strategies are discussed in an interactive manner.   Wednesday: Journal Club   Residents review journal articles from major derma\u00adtology journals as well as the relevant non-derma\u00adtology literature; discussion takes place under the direction of multiple faculty. Other faculty members also attend. This session serves not only to keep residents and faculty abreast of the advances in our field, but to encourage critical reading and knowl\u00adedge of evidence-based medicine.   Thursday: Dermatopathology   Dermatopathology faculty members lead this discus\u00adsion of \u201cunknown slides\u201d that have been reviewed by residents prior to the session. A well-established and successful curriculum is updated annually. Clin\u00adicopathologic correlation sessions are held approxi\u00admately once per month.   Friday: Grand Rounds (Howard Fox Guest Lecture Series)   Formal lectures on topics of dermatologic relevance are presented by leading members of the national aca\u00addemic dermatologic communities, as well as related experts from outside the field of\u00a0dermatology. Resi\u00addents are thus exposed to the latest advances across the spectrum of the specialty.  Noon Conference:   Twice weekly at noontime, residents attend clinical con\u00adferences during which NYU Langone faculty members lead a discussion on interesting cases from the clinics and consult services at NYU Langone Medical Center and Bellevue, particularly those that have presented di\u00adagnostic or therapeutic challenges. In addition to clinical images and patient viewing at both sites, histopathologic correlation is provided by dermatopathology faculty and fellows at NYU Langone\u2019s Ambulatory Care Center.       \u00a0   Educational Experiences   Tuesday Night Conferences:   This conference series provides residents with a live patient viewing opportunity. Residents prepare protocols on interesting and unusual cases, and a member of the full-time or voluntary clinical faculty leads a discussion based on these cases. Dermatol\u00adogists throughout the New York Metropolitan area attend the conference. The evening also provides a forum for residents to hone their presentation skills. Each resident and clinical fellow speaks on a subject of his or her choice at one of these conferences yearly. There are five such conferences per year.   \u00a0   Faculty and Trainee Educational Conference:   The Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatolo\u00adgy\u2019s Educational Seminars provide a comfortable and open environment for participants to learn, discuss, and review subjects that may occur in daily activ\u00adities within their working environment. The semi\u00adnars allow faculty, trainees, and, on occasion, staff members to work as a group to understand each other, while educating our faculty and trainees on dermatology advances. This boosts confidence and communication on all levels, creating a friendly work\u00ading environment. At the conclusion of each seminar activity, participants will be able to recognize import\u00adant new developments in medical and procedural dermatology and in basic interpersonal situations.   \u00a0   Cutaneous Biology and Dermatology Annual Research Day:   Research Day is an annual, full-day educational, train\u00ading, and networking event led by the chair. Postdoc\u00adtoral basic and clinical fellows, residents, and faculty performing dermatologic research share their current research findings through presentations and poster sessions. The audience includes the department\u2019s Cu\u00adtaneous Biology Program\u2019s basic science faculty and physician-investigators in addition to our clinicians. A leading expert in the field of research is invited annu\u00adally to give a lecture on a topic of importance for con\u00adducting research or developing an investigative career. Past lectures have included how to conduct clinical research at NYU Langone Medical Center, funding research, presentation skills, journal writing, build\u00ading collaborative translational research teams, and designing multifaceted/multicentered clinical trials. In addition to presentations there are also poster ses\u00adsions to present additional research projects that are ongoing within the department and the department\u2019s Cutaneous Biology Program. The event is considered a forum to openly discuss research findings, as well as to foster new collaborations for future studies.   \u00a0   Advances in Dermatology Symposium:   Each year in June, the department hosts a two-day Continuing Medical Education conference to update participants on the latest information about a broad array of topics relevant to clinical dermatology. Pre\u00adsentations are made by NYU Langone faculty from dermatology and other departments, fellows, and visiting faculty. The goal is to expose participants to current knowledge in dermatology and related topics. This popular conference draws a national audience.   \u00a0   Local Conferences:   Residents attend meetings of the New York Acad\u00ademy of Medicine\u2019s Section of Dermatology and the Dermatologic Society of Greater New York, the country\u2019s largest regional dermatologic organization. Highlights include annual resident competitions held by each society.   \u00a0     National Conferences:   First- and third-year residents attend the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Second-year residents divide coverage for clinical responsibilities during the AAD Meeting. Addi\u00adtionally, residents may be sponsored to attend other national dermatologic meetings, with prior approval, at which they present clinical or research findings.
