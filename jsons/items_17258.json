Our highest priority is to ensure exceptional patient care for an incredibly diverse and underserved population while training Emergency Medicine residents to become outstanding physicians, both clinically and academically, in the vibrant and multicultural setting of New York City.   The Emergency Medicine Residency at NYU/Bellevue is a four-year program dedicated to training well-rounded physicians who learn to not only become superior clinicians, but also learn to become educators, researchers, and leaders in Emergency Medicine.\u00a0 Residents are exposed to tremendous diversity in clinical pathology and patient populations by rotating at three hospital centers all along First Avenue: Bellevue Hospital Center, NYU\u2019s Tisch Hospital, and the Manhattan VA Hospital.   As a resident here, you will care for patients who are diplomats and CEOs as well as those suffering from mental illness, substance abuse, and homelessness. You will experience life a different way every day as you care for patients from all over the world and from all socioeconomic strata who seek your assistance. You will be an integral part of the public health of the community in New York City.   Residents are given graded responsibility as they progress through the program with an emphasis on teaching. Residents are supervised and taught by board-certified Emergency Medicine physicians in a collegial and enthusiastic environment. Our goal is to raise the level of emergency care across the country and across the world.   Thank you for your interest in our program and website.\u00a0 Please feel free to contact us with any questions or comments about our residency.
