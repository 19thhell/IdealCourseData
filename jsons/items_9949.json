                 Jan 07, 2011                                The\u00a0 Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University , seeks to make\u00a0 an appointment (tenured or tenure-track, rank open) of a wide-ranging scholar in the languages, literatures, and cultures of the Near East in the Roman, Late Antique, and early Islamic periods. The principal areas of interest should be in the Semitic languages (Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic, in particular) rather than in Greek, but specialization is less important than broad interests and connections with neighboring regions and cultures. We seek individuals of scholarly distinction whose work will benefit from freedom from departmental structures and who will be stimulated by working closely with colleagues in other disciplines, approaches, periods, or geographical areas and who are committed to helping develop the intellectual life of such a community. Applicants with a history of interdisciplinary exchange are particularly welcome. The Institute\u2019s graduate program emphasizes individual supervision and research seminars. The faculty is involved in choosing a group of visiting researchers each year.    Applications (letter, curriculum vitae, and list of referees) should be made through the NYU online system at\u00a0 www.nyuopsearch.com/applicants/Central?quickFind=50564 . Review of candidates will begin on November 1, 2010. For questions, please email Ms. Kathryn Lawson at\u00a0 kathryn.lawson@nyu.edu .
