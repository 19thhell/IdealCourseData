Regardless of your family's financial circumstances, paying for college will probably require a substantial commitment of your resources over the next several years. It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

These instructions are applicable also to returning students who may have borrowed federal loans in the past.

Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.

YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page.

CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration. The FAFSA can be filed at any time to be reviewed for federal aid eligibility.

NYU requires the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application (for new freshmen only, to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid), the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid), and, for residents of New York State, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) application.       Go to Applications and Forms for complete instructions       Student Aid Report (SAR)  When your FAFSA information has been processed you will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) from the U.S. Department of Education. Review it for accuracy, be sure that all required sections are complete, and verify that federal school number 002785 is indicated for New York University. Follow the SAR instructions to make changes or corrections if necessary (e.g. final income tax return information). Do not send it to NYU. Once the corrections are received by the federal processor, a final SAR will be sent to you for your records. You may view your SAR record and make changes on the FAFSA website .   NYU Award Package  Once you are officially admitted to NYU, if you are eligible we will send to you an official notification that describes your total financial aid package and details the types and amounts of student aid offered to you for the school year. Be sure to read our Financial Aid Guide , which describes the various forms of aid and reviews the components of your package.   Scholarships  There is no separate application for NYU scholarships. All students are automatically considered for academic (merit-based) and financial need-based scholarships upon their application for admission and financial aid. Scholarship awards are based on eligibility and the availability of funds.     Go to Scholarships and Grants     Loans  A financial aid package at NYU may suggest several types of loans for which a student is eligible, based on certain criteria (such as anticipated points/credits, housing status, financial need, etc.) and, for campus-administered loans, the availability of funds.     Go to Types of Financial Aid     Requests for Documentation: Tax Information and Income Verification  It is not necessary to submit copies of your tax returns or any other family financial records or supporting documentation to the Office of Financial Aid unless you are specifically requested to provide additional information.

Regardless of your family's financial circumstances, paying for college will probably require a substantial commitment of your resources over the next several years. It may surprise you to learn that most full-time undergraduate students at New York University would not be able to pay their educational costs without financial assistance. These students are able to attend NYU only because they applied for and received financial aid.    While we believe that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs rests with the student and the family, New York University as well as the state and federal governments can help. Although NYU is not able to meet the full need of every student, by combining the various types of funds available we use every method possible to coordinate adequate resources to enable you to invest in a higher education at NYU.    If you believe you will need any amount of financial assistance to attend NYU, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid immediately.

Review important information to ensure the proper disbursement of your financial aid awards .   If you have been awarded Federal Direct Loans, be sure to read our instructions to secure those Direct Loans . These instructions are applicable also to returning students who may have borrowed federal loans in the past. You are encouraged to review the definitions of the loans before pursuing these or any educational loan. Please think carefully about your obligations as a borrower before pursuing any educational loan. Consider your educational investment at NYU, as well as your long term financial commitments, when borrowing.   Read the Financial Aid Guide , which provides essential information to accompany your NYU financial aid award package for the academic year.   Students must meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress to remain eligible for financial aid. Be sure to follow the requirements of your program/department.

The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).

International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. The PROFILE is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test.

Admission to NYU Shanghai is need-blind, and financial support will be tailored for each indivdual family based upon the results of the PROFILE.     For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration. The FAFSA can be filed at any time to be reviewed for federal aid eligibility.
