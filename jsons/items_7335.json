Documentary   News and Documentary prepares students to report and produce short form and long form journalism for traditional and non-traditional media. From the first class, students are on the streets reporting, shooting and editing. We emphasize not only the story, but the storytelling. Our goal is to have a student skilled in both form and content, able tell a story by effectively using all aspects of the medium.   The Reporting I class begins with the basics of short form stories in a variety of formats and genres. After a progression of reporting classes, the curriculum culminates with each student producing a thirty-minute documentary . Our News Magazine editing class coincides with the Advanced Reporting class to give extra support to the production of the documentary. News Doc students have the opportunity to take electives university wide.

We also host filmmaker screenings throughout the year so students can see current work and interact with filmmakers to learn more about the process and different styles.   Our students are in demand for internships at all the major  broadcast news organizations and websites in New York as well as at  smaller documentary production companies.   \u00a0   Our Specialness   NewsDoc is special because it is among the most creative programs in journalism education. Many journalism programs today use multimedia as a catch phrase: it has become short hand for scratching the surface of everything. The problem with that approach is that you master nothing.   NewsDoc still takes the long view. It values in-depth long form journalism and takes the time to get there. Its curriculum is made up of building blocks with each class and semester layering on what came before. The diverse backgrounds of the faculty \u2013 film documentary, broadcast news, TV news magazine, multimedia reporting, even magazine writing \u2013 is a testament to the program\u2019s respect for storytelling in all forms and exposes students to a variety of tools to draw from. That is how you truly master your craft and it is evident in the annual News Doc Film Festival. You leave us prepared to work in news at the networks, a documentary production company, VICE, New York Times video or on your own.   \u00a0   Fellow Students  NewsDoc also has a tradition of attracting students from all over the  world. This commitment to creating an intimate international group each year is the best newsroom setting we can imagine. Students partner on projects, share feedback, and foster a strong professional environment. Most incoming students have two-three years of professional and intern experience in some aspect of journalism but that is not a requirement. We\u2019re interested in interesting students who have something to say.  \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0   Rialda Zukic (2014) films her thesis documentary in Sarajevo, Bosnia.

Documentary   News and Documentary prepares students to report and produce short form and long form journalism for traditional and non-traditional media. From the first class, students are on the streets reporting, shooting and editing. We emphasize not only the story, but the storytelling. Our goal is to have a student skilled in both form and content, able tell a story by effectively using all aspects of the medium.   The Reporting I class begins with the basics of short form stories in a variety of formats and genres. After a progression of reporting classes, the curriculum culminates with each student producing a thirty-minute documentary . Our News Magazine editing class coincides with the Advanced Reporting class to give extra support to the production of the documentary. News Doc students have the opportunity to take electives university wide.   Please visit our\u00a0 NewsDoc site for more information about the program      \u00a0   NewsDoc Alumni on Producing their First Films at NYU   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   \u00a0   New Master Classes   Not only do students work with full time faculty, but we now have a series of MASTER CLASSES that bring in the best independent documentary filmmakers in New York  City. We also host filmmaker screenings throughout the year so students can see current work and interact with filmmakers to learn more about the process and different styles.   Our students are in demand for internships at all the major  broadcast news organizations and websites in New York as well as at  smaller documentary production companies.   \u00a0   Our Specialness   NewsDoc is special because it is among the most creative programs in journalism education. Many journalism programs today use multimedia as a catch phrase: it has become short hand for scratching the surface of everything. The problem with that approach is that you master nothing.   NewsDoc still takes the long view. It values in-depth long form journalism and takes the time to get there. Its curriculum is made up of building blocks with each class and semester layering on what came before. The diverse backgrounds of the faculty \u2013 film documentary, broadcast news, TV news magazine, multimedia reporting, even magazine writing \u2013 is a testament to the program\u2019s respect for storytelling in all forms and exposes students to a variety of tools to draw from. That is how you truly master your craft and it is evident in the annual News Doc Film Festival. You leave us prepared to work in news at the networks, a documentary production company, VICE, New York Times video or on your own.   \u00a0   Fellow Students  NewsDoc also has a tradition of attracting students from all over the  world. This commitment to creating an intimate international group each year is the best newsroom setting we can imagine. Students partner on projects, share feedback, and foster a strong professional environment. Most incoming students have two-three years of professional and intern experience in some aspect of journalism but that is not a requirement. We\u2019re interested in interesting students who have something to say.  \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0   Rialda Zukic (2014) films her thesis documentary in Sarajevo, Bosnia.

Documentary   News and Documentary prepares students to report and produce short form and long form journalism for traditional and non-traditional media. From the first class, students are on the streets reporting, shooting and editing. We emphasize not only the story, but the storytelling. Our goal is to have a student skilled in both form and content, able tell a story by effectively using all aspects of the medium.   The Reporting I class begins with the basics of short form stories in a variety of formats and genres. After a progression of reporting classes, the curriculum culminates with each student producing a thirty-minute documentary . Our News Magazine editing class coincides with the Advanced Reporting class to give extra support to the production of the documentary. News Doc students have the opportunity to take electives university wide.

We also host filmmaker screenings throughout the year so students can see current work and interact with filmmakers to learn more about the process and different styles.   Our students are in demand for internships at all the major  broadcast news organizations and websites in New York as well as at  smaller documentary production companies.   \u00a0   Our Specialness   NewsDoc is special because it is among the most creative programs in journalism education. Many journalism programs today use multimedia as a catch phrase: it has become short hand for scratching the surface of everything. The problem with that approach is that you master nothing.   NewsDoc still takes the long view. It values in-depth long form journalism and takes the time to get there. Its curriculum is made up of building blocks with each class and semester layering on what came before. The diverse backgrounds of the faculty \u2013 film documentary, broadcast news, TV news magazine, multimedia reporting, even magazine writing \u2013 is a testament to the program\u2019s respect for storytelling in all forms and exposes students to a variety of tools to draw from. That is how you truly master your craft and it is evident in the annual News Doc Film Festival. You leave us prepared to work in news at the networks, a documentary production company, VICE, New York Times video or on your own.   \u00a0   Fellow Students  NewsDoc also has a tradition of attracting students from all over the  world. This commitment to creating an intimate international group each year is the best newsroom setting we can imagine. Students partner on projects, share feedback, and foster a strong professional environment. Most incoming students have two-three years of professional and intern experience in some aspect of journalism but that is not a requirement. We\u2019re interested in interesting students who have something to say.  \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0   Rialda Zukic (2014) films her thesis documentary in Sarajevo, Bosnia.

Any person with an eye or ear toward pop culture and consumer trends knows that traditional television viewership is declining. Whether it be network news casts that have been replaced by internet news aggregators or former staples, such as premium cable movie channels\u2014uprooted in favor of paid streaming services, consumer tastes have shifted away from the tube, towards alternative internet based programming. A recent Washington Post article, found here , gives little hope to traditional television media, in a chronicle of the accelerating trend towards internet based substitutions. However, in the wake of accelerating biannual decline, to the tune of almost 10 percent, author Cecilia King reveals that broadcast and cable networks are fighting back. These networks are attempting to claw back some market share, by entering the very market that is quickly eroding their decades old platform.   The last few years has seen a rise of online video viewership, as the Post article points out, roughly \u201c40 percent of U.S. homes\u201d, up from just 36 percent last year, subscribe to at least one paid internet streaming service like Netflix or Hulu. For traditional networks, hungry for advertising fees and licensing arrangements, this trend is difficult to ignore. Networks such as HBO, NBC, and CBS have either launched or announced plans for streaming services to compete with current internet incumbents. While new service providers in an already dense market unquestionably strokes the public\u2019s desire for more price and quality competition, the increase in service options comes with a matched increase in opportunities for consumer privacy information appropriations and mishaps.   With these new entrants, the internet programming industry is becoming more diffuse. Consumers will likely no longer be giving information merely to the cable company and one other internet provider such as Netflix. For example, I have already eschewed cable for a combination, though not simultaneously, of Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO-Go and Hulu subscriptions as well as \u201cfree\u201d providers like YouTube and Twitch.tv. As in my case, consumers are no longer putting their identifying information, address, credit card information, email address, viewing habits in the hands of one or two companies. Rather, in order to match and surpass the level of choice they once had through network and cable TV, consumers may very well sign up for multiple streaming services, the combined cost of which is still less than traditional television. The rub of course is, that to access these services, consumers must in effect deal with multiple companies and provide varied information to each of them. This raises privacy concerns that are much more nascent than when there was only one video entertainment provider.   Ask any regular user of \u201cfree\u201d video providers such as YouTube and they will tell you that the website has an uncanny ability to recommend new videos based on your history and subscriptions, as well as tailor advertising towards your interests. While you do not necessarily have to sign-up to YouTube to access its content, linking your Google account to YouTube arguably enhances your experience and augments this tailoring. Paid subscription services like Netflix operate similarly by tracking your preferences and spitting out recommendations. There is no doubt that this preference data, collected by Google, Netflix, and the like, is valuable\u2014evidenced by the ubiquitous tailored advertising located on many websites. In addition to preference metadata, paid services require you provide them billing information, meaning, that you must give them, among other things, your credit card information and name. With the entry of more paid services, consumers must give this static data to more and more companies. A short example may shed light on one concern presented by only one provider. Perusing Netflix&#8217;s stated privacy policy as of March 12, 2015, reveals that it sends consumer information oversees for what it bills as provision of services. Netflix notes that \u201cthe countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country, although your personal information will continue to be protected in accordance with the standards described in this policy.&#8221; While it is comforting that Netflix will endeavor to protect our information, the information is not invulnerable to theft or misappropriation overseas.   But what is a consumer supposed to do when faced with an increased number of service providers, each with their own informational requirements and privacy policy? The question is daunting and may call for a more unified industry wide standard to bring privacy sharing policies back in line with consumer expectations as to traditional television providers. While this is by no means the correct answer to the question, one thing is clear, with more market participants, the opportunities for perceived and actual privacy breaches increase, an unsettling proposition for consumers.
