To book an appointment with a PWA, select your desired, available time and leave a brief description of what you would like to work on. You must be logged into your NYU Gmail account to make an appointment.   Students are recommended to make appointments online, however, feel free to drop by during the open hours to see if a PWA is available.

Work within the parameters of a particular assignment . For example, we can look over your paper with &quot;fresh eyes&quot; to see if your writing conveys what you want it to.       We don't\u2026       Quickly &quot;fix&quot; papers or look only for grammatical errors.   During your appointment we may address grammar and usage, though in the service of helping you articulate ideas within your piece overall. We are happy to provide additional resources and tips for proofreading.     Additional information\u2026       Bring a printed copy (preferably two) of your writing.   Bring the assignment or prompt from your professor so that we can more accurately guide you.   Be on time for your appointment. Unfortunately when students are late, the appointment still ends at the scheduled time. Students are welcome to sign up for an appointment at a later date for additional help.   Walk-ins are welcome ! Be mindful of the appointment schedule and prepare to arrive on time.   If you need to cancel an appointment, please do so online and free up space for other students. If in the event the Writing Center must close during a time you have a scheduled appointment, you will receive an email and request to reschedule.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

To book an appointment with a PWA, select your desired, available time and leave a brief description of what you would like to work on. You must be logged into your NYU Gmail account to make an appointment.   Students are recommended to make appointments online, however, feel free to drop by during the open hours to see if a PWA is available.                             Gallatin undergraduates work together in the Writing Center.           Questions? Email Syma Mohammed , Writing Program Graduate Assistant.

Work within the parameters of a particular assignment . For example, we can look over your paper with &quot;fresh eyes&quot; to see if your writing conveys what you want it to.       We don't\u2026       Quickly &quot;fix&quot; papers or look only for grammatical errors.   During your appointment we may address grammar and usage, though in the service of helping you articulate ideas within your piece overall. We are happy to provide additional resources and tips for proofreading.     Additional information\u2026       Bring a printed copy (preferably two) of your writing.   Bring the assignment or prompt from your professor so that we can more accurately guide you.   Be on time for your appointment. Unfortunately when students are late, the appointment still ends at the scheduled time. Students are welcome to sign up for an appointment at a later date for additional help.   Walk-ins are welcome ! Be mindful of the appointment schedule and prepare to arrive on time.   If you need to cancel an appointment, please do so online and free up space for other students. If in the event the Writing Center must close during a time you have a scheduled appointment, you will receive an email and request to reschedule.                      top of page                                                                        NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
