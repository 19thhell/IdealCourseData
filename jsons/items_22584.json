Reflecting this focus on undergraduate  education, faculty members of the Department are chosen both for their  outstanding achievements as scholars and for their dedication to  teaching. We offer courses in the history of Western art and  architecture from antiquity to the present and in a wide variety of  other traditions, from Latin America to East Asia, South Asia, and the  Islamic world. The former New York Times art critic John Russell called  us \"the best undergraduate department of art history in the country.\" The  hundreds of museums, galleries, and notable works of architecture in  New York make NYU the ideal place in which to pursue an interest in the  visual arts. Some of our courses are taught at these locations, in the  presence of the actual works of art. Others draw on our vast slide  collection and our new digital database. The Department offers  two undergraduate majors, one in Art History and another in Urban  Design and Architecture Studies. Art History majors may minor in Studio  Art at the Steinhardt School. Art History may also be combined (as  either a major or a minor) with a second major in another department.  Some of our graduates have gone on to distinguished careers as  curators, critics, scholars, art dealers, fashion designers,  architects, urban planners, and architectural preservationists; others  have continued to enjoy art and architecture while pursuing careers in  different fields.
