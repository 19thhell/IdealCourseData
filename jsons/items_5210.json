[{"detail": [{"content": "how to write a math proof       how to write a math proof        We did a few simple proofs today in linear algebra class. It's one of the harder things for students to get good at. Lots of times the statement you're trying to prove makes perfect sense, but where do you begin to write the proof?    Here's an example. We defined what it means for a set of vectors v_1, v_2, ... v_k to be linearly dependent.       Definition : v_1, v_2, ... v_k are linearly dependent if there exist numbers c_1, c_2, ... c_k, not all 0, so that   c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + ... + c_k v_k = 0       Now the problem:       Prove that two vectors are linearly dependent if and only if they are multiples of each other.      'If and only if' statements come up all the time in math - it means that two things are equivalent: if one is true then the other is true and the other way around. They're useful because you can use whichever statement is more convenient for you - they mean the same thing. To prove an 'if and only' if statement you have to prove both directions. We sometimes write 'if and only if' as 'iff'. To prove \"A iff B\" we need to prove both \"If A then B\" and \"If B then A\".      So first we'll prove: \"If two vectors are multiples of each other, then they are linearly dependent.\"    We have given information (\"Two vectors are multiples of each other\") and a statement we need to prove (\"The two vectors are linearly dependent\"). The first step is to translate these English sentences into math statements that we can work with. We first give our two vectors names: v_1 and v_2 (we don't want to work with vectors of actual numbers because we want to prove this for all  possible vectors). How do we write mathematically that v_1 and v_2 are multiples of each other? We say:   ( GIVEN ) v_1 = a v_2  for some number 'a' (again we don't need to know what the multiplier is, just that it's some number). And next we translate the second statement into math. \"v_1 and v_2 are linearly dependent\" means there exist c_1 and c_2, not both 0, so that   ( WTS ) c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 =0  (WTS stands for 'want to show'). The next step is to do math to get from (GIVEN) to (WTS). We just subtract a v_2 from both sides in (GIVEN) to get:   v_1 - a_v2 = 0  Now if we set c_1 = 1 and c_2 = -a, then this equation becomes   c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 = 0  which is (WTS). And since c_1=1, c_1 and c_2 are not both 0. So we're done with this direction.    The other direction is similar. Now we are given that there exist c_1 and c_2, not both 0, so that   ( GIVEN ) c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 =0   And we want to show that:   ( WTS ) v_1 = a v_2   Say c_1 is not 0. (If c_1 = 0 we could do the same thing but with 1 and 2 reversed). Then we can solve (GIVEN) for v_1:   v_1 = -c_2/c_1 v_2   where we can divide both sides by c_1 since it is not 0. Now we set a=-c2/c_1 and we get   v_1 = a v_2   which is (WTS). So we are done.       To recap : we first state the information that we are given and the statement we want to prove.  We use definitions to translate these English sentences into mathematical statements. Then we turn (GIVEN) into (WTS) by using legal mathematical operations. Of course choosing these operations can be quite tricky and require clever ideas, but this at least is how to get started."}]},

SPCED-UE 1005    Teaching Students with Disabilities in the General Education Classroom    Increasingly, students with a variety of disabilities are remaining in the general education classroom. This course is designed for non-special education majors and those from related service areas who recognize the need to understand the issues and possibilities for working successfully with these students. Sample topics include: current legislation, availability of resources and related services, parenting issues and instructional strategies.                   General Pedagogical Core Syllabi and Course Descriptions          Course ID Title Description             TCHL-UE 0001    Inquiries Into Teaching &amp; Learning I    Inquiries I explores two themes: Learners and Learning and Teachers and Teaching. Students are introduced to teaching and learning by reconstructing, critiquing and sharing their own educational histories, and by reading and responding to the autobiographies and memoirs of learners and teachers of diverse backgrounds, needs, and experiences. The course focuses on way to promote and assess learning, support learners' interests, foster effective communication, honor diversity, create democratic learning environments, and enable teachers to fulfill their responsibility to self, others, school and community. By applying relevant professional literature to their micro teaching and their observations in school settings, students examine how the classroom context shapes the acquisition of knowledge, attitudes, and skills.          TCHL-UE 0005    Field Observations             TCHL-UE 0041    American Dilemmas: Race, Inequality &amp; the Unfulfilled Promise of Public Education    The course provides students with background on the historical &amp; sociological foundation of education in the United States. It examines the role that education has played in advancing civil &amp; human rights &amp; it explores the ways in which education continues to be implicated in the maintenance of social inequality in American society. Through readings, lectures, films &amp; class debates, students will gain an understanding of some of the most complex &amp; controversial issues confronting education today including: affirmative action, Bi-Lingual Education, Special Education, the achievement gap, school choice &amp; vouchers, &amp; the role of race &amp; culture in student achievement.
