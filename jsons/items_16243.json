national communities and across nations. The program is motivated by the conviction that understanding the complex dynamics of peace and conflict can facilitate the work of making the world a more just and peaceful place.   The Peace Studies program draws on tools and methods from an array of disciplines in order to examine both the sources of conflict and the strategies and institutions that aim to resolve or prevent conflict, from methods of grass-roots local engagement to diplomacy, mediation, and international intervention. It analyzes peacemaking strategies across vastly divergent scales, from the contributions of individuals and small groups to the work of nations and multilateral organizations.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the social, economic, and political dynamics affecting peace and conflict, the Peace Studies program also investigates the psychological factors that can cause or resolve conflict, such as the psychological roots of prejudice and aggression and the psychological origins of attitudes of reconciliation and cooperation that allow enemies to transcend seemingly intractable conflicts and societies to build bridges across painful and deeply-rooted divides.   Additional courses rooted in the humanities and arts aim to deepen our understanding of the philosophical and human dimensions of peace and conflict. They pose questions such as: Can war ever be just? Can the priority of peace ever be used as a tool to preserve unjust institutions? More generally, these courses raise the question of whether the exercise of artistic creativity or inquiry into the human condition can foster peacebuilding, cross-cultural communication, and a greater sense of empathy with other human beings.     The ideas and issues addressed by the Peace Studies concentration include:     the challenges and strategies involved in promoting the peaceful resolution of conflict   the costs of conflict and of the reconstruction of post-conflict societies from economic, social, psychological, and legal perspectives   conflict and non-violence   the psychological dimensions of conflict, prejudice, cooperation, and reconciliation   peacekeeping   transitional justice and post-conflict reconciliation   post-conflict state-building   migration and post-conflict economic development   disarmament   international law and governance   the ethics of war and peace   the history of wars and peacemaking   artistic responses to war and roles for art in peacebuilding     The program draws on courses in the Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science as well as pre-professional courses in Law and in Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship. Students interested in international relations, comparative politics, economic development, social change and social justice, public service, anthropology, the arts and humanities may find special relevance in the Peace Studies program, as will students participating in Engineers for Social Impact, an activity organized by the Engineering program.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 212J International Law                                                                              &ldquo;Inter-national&rdquo; law, which the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham defined as the rules governing sovereign nations, is today more like a curriculum than a single course. Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,  violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

Sub-themes will include an analysis of four kinds of truth, the problem of denialism, and the difference and relation between restorative and punitive justice. The course will offer comparative reflections on how similar issues have been dealt with in Northern Ireland, Colombia and Sri Lanka.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

PEACE-AD 124 Causes and Prevention of Violence                                             This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine &ndash; indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of &ldquo;political religions&rdquo; &ndash; Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency.

We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

national communities and across nations. The program is motivated by the conviction that understanding the complex dynamics of peace and conflict can facilitate the work of making the world a more just and peaceful place.   The Peace Studies program draws on tools and methods from an array of disciplines in order to examine both the sources of conflict and the strategies and institutions that aim to resolve or prevent conflict, from methods of grass-roots local engagement to diplomacy, mediation, and international intervention. It analyzes peacemaking strategies across vastly divergent scales, from the contributions of individuals and small groups to the work of nations and multilateral organizations.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the social, economic, and political dynamics affecting peace and conflict, the Peace Studies program also investigates the psychological factors that can cause or resolve conflict, such as the psychological roots of prejudice and aggression and the psychological origins of attitudes of reconciliation and cooperation that allow enemies to transcend seemingly intractable conflicts and societies to build bridges across painful and deeply-rooted divides.   Additional courses rooted in the humanities and arts aim to deepen our understanding of the philosophical and human dimensions of peace and conflict. They pose questions such as: Can war ever be just? Can the priority of peace ever be used as a tool to preserve unjust institutions? More generally, these courses raise the question of whether the exercise of artistic creativity or inquiry into the human condition can foster peacebuilding, cross-cultural communication, and a greater sense of empathy with other human beings.     The ideas and issues addressed by the Peace Studies concentration include:     the challenges and strategies involved in promoting the peaceful resolution of conflict   the costs of conflict and of the reconstruction of post-conflict societies from economic, social, psychological, and legal perspectives   conflict and non-violence   the psychological dimensions of conflict, prejudice, cooperation, and reconciliation   peacekeeping   transitional justice and post-conflict reconciliation   post-conflict state-building   migration and post-conflict economic development   disarmament   international law and governance   the ethics of war and peace   the history of wars and peacemaking   artistic responses to war and roles for art in peacebuilding     The program draws on courses in the Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science as well as pre-professional courses in Law and in Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship. Students interested in international relations, comparative politics, economic development, social change and social justice, public service, anthropology, the arts and humanities may find special relevance in the Peace Studies program, as will students participating in Engineers for Social Impact, an activity organized by the Engineering program.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 212J International Law                                                                              &ldquo;Inter-national&rdquo; law, which the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham defined as the rules governing sovereign nations, is today more like a curriculum than a single course. Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,  violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

PEACE-AD 124 Causes and Prevention of Violence                                             This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine &ndash; indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of &ldquo;political religions&rdquo; &ndash; Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

POLSC-AD 176J Nation-Building                                                                   Nation-Building explores the range of strategies which strong states use in order to build the capacity of weak ones. This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency.

POLSC-AD 179J Political Conflict and Economic Development                                                                               It is now widely acknowledged that political conflicts play a major role in driving economic development trajectories. We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

national communities and across nations. The program is motivated by the conviction that understanding the complex dynamics of peace and conflict can facilitate the work of making the world a more just and peaceful place.   The Peace Studies program draws on tools and methods from an array of disciplines in order to examine both the sources of conflict and the strategies and institutions that aim to resolve or prevent conflict, from methods of grass-roots local engagement to diplomacy, mediation, and international intervention. It analyzes peacemaking strategies across vastly divergent scales, from the contributions of individuals and small groups to the work of nations and multilateral organizations.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the social, economic, and political dynamics affecting peace and conflict, the Peace Studies program also investigates the psychological factors that can cause or resolve conflict, such as the psychological roots of prejudice and aggression and the psychological origins of attitudes of reconciliation and cooperation that allow enemies to transcend seemingly intractable conflicts and societies to build bridges across painful and deeply-rooted divides.   Additional courses rooted in the humanities and arts aim to deepen our understanding of the philosophical and human dimensions of peace and conflict. They pose questions such as: Can war ever be just? Can the priority of peace ever be used as a tool to preserve unjust institutions? More generally, these courses raise the question of whether the exercise of artistic creativity or inquiry into the human condition can foster peacebuilding, cross-cultural communication, and a greater sense of empathy with other human beings.     The ideas and issues addressed by the Peace Studies concentration include:     the challenges and strategies involved in promoting the peaceful resolution of conflict   the costs of conflict and of the reconstruction of post-conflict societies from economic, social, psychological, and legal perspectives   conflict and non-violence   the psychological dimensions of conflict, prejudice, cooperation, and reconciliation   peacekeeping   transitional justice and post-conflict reconciliation   post-conflict state-building   migration and post-conflict economic development   disarmament   international law and governance   the ethics of war and peace   the history of wars and peacemaking   artistic responses to war and roles for art in peacebuilding     The program draws on courses in the Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science as well as pre-professional courses in Law and in Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship. Students interested in international relations, comparative politics, economic development, social change and social justice, public service, anthropology, the arts and humanities may find special relevance in the Peace Studies program, as will students participating in Engineers for Social Impact, an activity organized by the Engineering program.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 212J International Law                                                                              &ldquo;Inter-national&rdquo; law, which the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham defined as the rules governing sovereign nations, is today more like a curriculum than a single course. Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,  violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

PEACE-AD 124 Causes and Prevention of Violence                                             This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine &ndash; indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of &ldquo;political religions&rdquo; &ndash; Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

POLSC-AD 176J Nation-Building                                                                   Nation-Building explores the range of strategies which strong states use in order to build the capacity of weak ones. This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency.

We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

national communities and across nations. The program is motivated by the conviction that understanding the complex dynamics of peace and conflict can facilitate the work of making the world a more just and peaceful place.   The Peace Studies program draws on tools and methods from an array of disciplines in order to examine both the sources of conflict and the strategies and institutions that aim to resolve or prevent conflict, from methods of grass-roots local engagement to diplomacy, mediation, and international intervention. It analyzes peacemaking strategies across vastly divergent scales, from the contributions of individuals and small groups to the work of nations and multilateral organizations.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the social, economic, and political dynamics affecting peace and conflict, the Peace Studies program also investigates the psychological factors that can cause or resolve conflict, such as the psychological roots of prejudice and aggression and the psychological origins of attitudes of reconciliation and cooperation that allow enemies to transcend seemingly intractable conflicts and societies to build bridges across painful and deeply-rooted divides.   Additional courses rooted in the humanities and arts aim to deepen our understanding of the philosophical and human dimensions of peace and conflict. They pose questions such as: Can war ever be just? Can the priority of peace ever be used as a tool to preserve unjust institutions? More generally, these courses raise the question of whether the exercise of artistic creativity or inquiry into the human condition can foster peacebuilding, cross-cultural communication, and a greater sense of empathy with other human beings.     The ideas and issues addressed by the Peace Studies concentration include:     the challenges and strategies involved in promoting the peaceful resolution of conflict   the costs of conflict and of the reconstruction of post-conflict societies from economic, social, psychological, and legal perspectives   conflict and non-violence   the psychological dimensions of conflict, prejudice, cooperation, and reconciliation   peacekeeping   transitional justice and post-conflict reconciliation   post-conflict state-building   migration and post-conflict economic development   disarmament   international law and governance   the ethics of war and peace   the history of wars and peacemaking   artistic responses to war and roles for art in peacebuilding     The program draws on courses in the Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science as well as pre-professional courses in Law and in Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship. Students interested in international relations, comparative politics, economic development, social change and social justice, public service, anthropology, the arts and humanities may find special relevance in the Peace Studies program, as will students participating in Engineers for Social Impact, an activity organized by the Engineering program.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 212J International Law                                                                              &ldquo;Inter-national&rdquo; law, which the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham defined as the rules governing sovereign nations, is today more like a curriculum than a single course. Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,  violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

PEACE-AD 124 Causes and Prevention of Violence                                             This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine &ndash; indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of &ldquo;political religions&rdquo; &ndash; Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

POLSC-AD 176J Nation-Building                                                                   Nation-Building explores the range of strategies which strong states use in order to build the capacity of weak ones. This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency.

POLSC-AD 179J Political Conflict and Economic Development                                                                               It is now widely acknowledged that political conflicts play a major role in driving economic development trajectories. We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

national communities and across nations. The program is motivated by the conviction that understanding the complex dynamics of peace and conflict can facilitate the work of making the world a more just and peaceful place.   The Peace Studies program draws on tools and methods from an array of disciplines in order to examine both the sources of conflict and the strategies and institutions that aim to resolve or prevent conflict, from methods of grass-roots local engagement to diplomacy, mediation, and international intervention. It analyzes peacemaking strategies across vastly divergent scales, from the contributions of individuals and small groups to the work of nations and multilateral organizations.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the social, economic, and political dynamics affecting peace and conflict, the Peace Studies program also investigates the psychological factors that can cause or resolve conflict, such as the psychological roots of prejudice and aggression and the psychological origins of attitudes of reconciliation and cooperation that allow enemies to transcend seemingly intractable conflicts and societies to build bridges across painful and deeply-rooted divides.   Additional courses rooted in the humanities and arts aim to deepen our understanding of the philosophical and human dimensions of peace and conflict. They pose questions such as: Can war ever be just? Can the priority of peace ever be used as a tool to preserve unjust institutions? More generally, these courses raise the question of whether the exercise of artistic creativity or inquiry into the human condition can foster peacebuilding, cross-cultural communication, and a greater sense of empathy with other human beings.     The ideas and issues addressed by the Peace Studies concentration include:     the challenges and strategies involved in promoting the peaceful resolution of conflict   the costs of conflict and of the reconstruction of post-conflict societies from economic, social, psychological, and legal perspectives   conflict and non-violence   the psychological dimensions of conflict, prejudice, cooperation, and reconciliation   peacekeeping   transitional justice and post-conflict reconciliation   post-conflict state-building   migration and post-conflict economic development   disarmament   international law and governance   the ethics of war and peace   the history of wars and peacemaking   artistic responses to war and roles for art in peacebuilding     The program draws on courses in the Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science as well as pre-professional courses in Law and in Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship. Students interested in international relations, comparative politics, economic development, social change and social justice, public service, anthropology, the arts and humanities may find special relevance in the Peace Studies program, as will students participating in Engineers for Social Impact, an activity organized by the Engineering program.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 212J International Law                                                                              &ldquo;Inter-national&rdquo; law, which the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham defined as the rules governing sovereign nations, is today more like a curriculum than a single course. Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,  violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

PEACE-AD 124 Causes and Prevention of Violence                                             This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine &ndash; indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of &ldquo;political religions&rdquo; &ndash; Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

POLSC-AD 176J Nation-Building                                                                   Nation-Building explores the range of strategies which strong states use in order to build the capacity of weak ones. This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency.

We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

                   Political Science at NYU Abu Dhabi attracts students who are interested in the many important political questions \u2014 conceptual, empirical, policy-oriented \u2014 that societies everywhere face today. How do different political systems affect policy-making? What are the intrinsic and instrumental virtues of democracy? Why do dictatorships survive in many countries, but evolve into democracies in others? Why do countries go to war? What are the connections between internal conflicts (such as civil war) and political or economic development? What are the main characteristics and causes of economic underdevelopment? Why are prosperity and stagnation distributed so unequally, both across countries and within them?   Major in Political Science   The student with a passion for questions such as these finds the Political Science major most rewarding. The philosophy underlying the courses has several distinctive features. First, the major has a strong analytical focus, with two required courses that introduce students to statistics and models of political behavior and institutions. These courses provide an introduction to the kinds of tools used by social scientists to conduct a deep analysis of these questions and to test the analysis using quantitative data. Second, the major offers many substantive courses, wherein these analytical tools are applied to important policy questions of considerable current interest. Third, the courses in the major include discussions of classic texts that illuminate both the intellectual history and the broader dimensions of these policy questions. Finally, the major offers several courses jointly with programs in Economics, Psychology, and Philosophy, providing students with exciting interdisciplinary opportunities.   Majors in Political Science take two required courses (Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Introduction to Political Thinking), two principal electives, and four general electives. The general electives are organized in the following areas: Methods; Political Theory and Institutions; Comparative Politics; and International Politics. In senior year, every student majoring in Political Science takes a two-course sequence of seminars, culminating in the production of a senior thesis in Political Science. During the first semester, students in Senior Seminar 1 develop a research question, construct a research design that allow them to test potential answers to that question, and collect relevant data. During the second semester, in Senior Seminar 2, students implement their proposed research design, analyze the results, and write their senior theses.

We begin by discussing the basic science and availability of energy sources, the state of technology, the functioning of energy markets, the challenges of coping with global climate change and the key role of the oil reserves in the Middle East. The second part of the course focuses on the history of oil in the Middle East and its impact on societies in the region.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Although policy makers often regard education as a means to promote greater equality and opportunity, empirical evidence suggests that more often than not, a child&rsquo;s background predicts how well they will perform in school and what types of employment opportunities will be available to them later in life. However, some nations do a better job than others in using education to expand opportunity. Understanding why some nations continue to have schools that struggle in their efforts to serve minorities and the poor children, and why other nations are experiencing greater success in this endeavor is the central aim of this course. We will also consider the ways in which teachers, students, parents and their allies, have used educational settings and the educational process as a focal point for resistance to social and cultural reproduction, and various forms of oppression and discrimination. The role of social identities related to class, race, language and ethnicity in shaping the experiences of students and teachers in the reproduction process, will be a primary focus of the course readings and class discussions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

In course readings and papers, we will examine how the meanings of &ldquo;nation&rdquo; in China shifted across the past century. We will also intersperse our classes with visits to schools and other educational sites, to study contemporary trends and dilemmas in the teaching of nationalism. At the end of the course, we will ask what other national school systems might learn from China&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, danger, and opportunity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 169 From the &quot;Chilean Road to Socialism&quot; to the Pinochet Era: Chile and the Global Cold War                                                         This course explores some of Latin America&rsquo;s most significant social and political events during the Cold War: the democratic election in 1970 of a Marxist president in Chile, his overthrow by a military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1973, and the installation of a military regime led by General Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1989. During this period, Chile attracted the world&rsquo;s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies.    This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile&#39;s social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile&rsquo;s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime.

We read foundational works from philosophy, sociology, political science, and law to explore why states punish, how they punish, and whom they punish. We focus on the modern American approach to punishment, including its use of mass incarceration and the death penalty. We analyze U.S. Supreme Court cases in light of the fundamental purposes of punishment, and compare penal practices around the world. Though subject to change, activities outside the classroom may include attending arraignment court, observing a sentencing hearing, and visiting a correctional facility.

Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The changing nature and media of contemporary globalized lawyering, and web-based access to what were traditionally arcane written sources of law, also renders a multi-media approach to the syllabus desirable. Reported cases will be mixed with film, television, and web-based depictions of legal norms. The course will examine the history, philosophy, method and disciplines of civil and common law. The course will provide students with a critical understanding of legal concepts, an introduction to the divisions of legal doctrine and an understanding of the most pressing issues facing the profession and governments today.

MDENV-AD 115 The Global Debate on Green Growth                                                                    In March 2012, the OECD published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources. In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.

The class will focus on major themes and issues such as the determinants of peaceful  cooperation and sustainable peace; the root causes of armed conflict; the determinants of ethnic conflict; the political economy of civil wars; the variables affecting the duration and termination of wars; the phenomenon of different forms of political violence-including protests, riots, military coups, political assassinations, and terrorism; and the politics and economics of peacebuilding. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will cover a wide variety of cases from a comparative perspective.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

What justifies the state&rsquo;s exercise of such authority? Could it be justified because we have at least implicitly given our consent to it? This is only one central question in political philosophy. Others include: What form of government best serves the people? Who are the people, anyway? What is justice? Do we have fundamental rights to property or to free expression? If so, what is the source of these rights? What is freedom, and are there different kinds? What is the proper relation between freedom and equality? Is equality desirable? Can we live in a genuine community that is not a community of equals? As we grapple with such questions, we draw on writings from both classical and contemporary philosophers.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles of social scientific experimentation and its uses. All types of social science experiments are explored: laboratory experiments, survey experiments, field experiments, and the new use of &quot;lab-in-the-field&quot; experiments. The course will discuss the issues of validity and artificiality in experimentation as well as the ethical concerns involved in experimental research. Students will have the opportunity to create and design their own experiment as part of the class.

The course focuses on individual decision makers in the world of politics (citizens, voters, legislators, executives, judges) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape political outcomes. Students study the formal modeling of political behavior and analyze the theories of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action). The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to illustrate how these models of political behavior and institutions can shed light on current political events.

POLSC-AD 131 Elections and Voting                                                        Elections and voting take place all over the world almost every day. In this course we will draw on both theory and evidence to investigate the interplay between voters&rsquo; preferences and electoral processes. We will focus on the current academic literature as well as elections that have taken place recently. Each week we will discuss and analyze a current election. Each semester the course will also involve an in depth examination of an election taking place during the semester, taking a class trip to meet individuals involved in the election process in that country. In Spring 2016 we will study and visit the Philippines which will be having a general election in early May and also discuss the presidential nomination process which will be taking place in the United States during the semester as well.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

Particular emphasis is placed on the United States, although international comparisons are also present. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.

Eckstein considers the political culture approach as \"one of the two still viable general approaches to political theory and explanation&hellip;the other still being political rational choice theory.\" This course examines major approaches to political culture and their relationship to democratic development. We discuss questions of how to define political culture, how political culture can be studied, and how it relates to democratic politics and political performance. The pros and cons of the political culture approach will be discussed in the concluding session.

This class involves a careful reading and analysis of his masterpiece, The Prince, in its historical context, with a focus on its principal theme, namely how and why political leaders gain and lose power. Students also study selected portions of The Discourses. In order to understand the nature of Machiavelli&rsquo;s &quot;republicanism&quot; and how it relates to the advice and warnings he gave to princes. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to Machiavelli&rsquo;s tomb in Santa Croce; the David of Verrocchio in the Bargello (a statue that Machiavelli saw every day on his way to his office); and the estate at Sant&rsquo;Andrea in Percussina, near San Casciano in Val di Pesa, where Machiavelli retired to write The Prince.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

POLSC-AD 143 Gender Parity                                              This course introduces students to the basic theories, empiricism and methodological concepts of women&#39;s and gender studies within political science. Following an overview session about global and regional patterns, each of the subsequent weeks will tackle a series of key gender and politics topics in turn. The course goes beyond gender inequality in the labor market to explore patterns of violence and political participation, among others. Lastly, the course provides basis for research, practical action and policy formulation and for evaluating directions and strategies for social change from a gender perspective.

POLSC-AD 150 Introduction to Comparative Politics                                             This course introduces students to the study of comparative politics and the study of domestic political institutions around the world. The course emphasizes the use of theory and evidence to generate and test hypotheses about both the causes and the consequences of the observed variation in domestic political institutions. For example, the course investigates the factors that lead some countries to democratize, and others to institute authoritarian governments, as well as the consequences of those institutional choices for policy outcomes. The course also looks at the variations in institutional arrangements within both democratic and non-democratic governments.

POLSC-AD 152X Comparative Politics of the Middle East                                                                                         A focus on the &quot;Arab Middle East&quot; presupposes that regional culture is a significant factor in explaining political outcomes in the region. For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth.

What explains the variation in the types of regimes&mdash;democratic and authoritarian&mdash; across South Asia? To what extent do these countries vary in the structure of their states as well as regimes? How does ethnic diversity affect the politics of South Asian countries? What is the pattern of economic growth across these countries, and their human development record and why? What explains the high levels of violence in some South Asian countries and patterns of variation across these countries? These are some of the questions that this course addresses, with a primary focus on India and a secondary focus on Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan. Although students learn a vast number of facts about the history and politics of the region, the primary purpose of the course is to identify overarching patterns that characterize the politics of these regions&mdash;and to teach students to think analytically and comparatively about these patterns.

With regard to the EU, classical governance issues of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making are both sharply drawn and the subject of explicit agreements between states. These same issues were explicitly confronted in the recent past by those involved in democratization and democratic consolidation central and eastern Europe. Western Europe is the intellectual \"home\" to many of the classical models of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making, yet all countries, and especially smaller countries, are now forced to adapt these models in a setting where the traditional notion of the \"stand alone\" nation-state is becoming ever less relevant.

POLSC-AD 159X Public Policy Challenges in the Middle East                                                                                         Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

POLSC-AD 160J Social Media and Political Participation                                                        In recent years, social media usage (Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Tumbler, etc.) has exploded to such an extent that it is impossible to believe it does not have an effect on the political behavior of citizens. The question remains, though, of how exactly does it matter? This is the focus of our course. In the morning sessions, student are first introduced to the most important topics of political behavior&mdash;voting, turnout, partisanship, public opinion formation, and protests and social movements&mdash;and then to the much newer literature on the usage of social media. In the afternoon sessions, students both visit social media companies located in New York City, and are taught the necessary tools to work on their own original research projects. These research projects are conducted in conjunction with NYU&rsquo;s new Social Media and Political Participation laboratory (smapp.nyu.edu).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 161 Comparative Politics of Africa                                             The goal of this course is to introduce participants to the study of African politics from multiple methodological approaches and in a number of African contexts. The course begins with the historical roots of contemporary African politics, exploring how pre-colonial institutions and colonialism shaped African politics at independence. Then, we survey the political and economic strategies of leaders post-independence and the factors shaping those strategies. We examine the causes and consequences of poor governance, and evaluate the recent patterns of redemocratization on the continent. The course closes with a discussion of present-day challenges: electoral malfeasance, public health crises, the &ldquo;new&rdquo; populism, and China in Africa.    * Recommended prerequisite: POLSC-AD 150.

We are especially concerned with analytically exploring major issues in international politics, such as the causes of war, the emergence of cooperative trade relations between states, the origins and functioning of international organizations such as the United Nations, and the political determinants of financial crises. The focus of the course is neither historical nor descriptive; rather, it requires students to exercise skills in logic and to think of imaginative ways to apply subtle techniques to gain a clearer grasp of the above political issues.

The course seeks to familiarize students with analytical tools that help them gain a better understanding of the current problems and opportunities facing actors in today&rsquo;s international political economy.

This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency. Students then travel to Kathmandu, Nepal to meet with participants in Nepal's 10-year civil war from 1996 to 2006 and learn their perspectives on these questions obtained from their experiences.

We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

The industrial revolution initially occurred in locations where coal was available. The discovery of oil, which provided a more transportable and more powerful source of energy, launched international competition for control of sources of oil. Oil cartels and powerful transnational oil companies have played vital roles in the politics, economics, and international policies of developed and developing nations, and access to oil has shaped the relationship of the Middle East to the world from the early 20th century to the present. This course explores these historical developments and considers how the need for energy has defined domestic politics and world developments over the past two centuries. Taking advantage of our location in Abu Dhabi, the course explores the relationship of an oil-producing region to the rest of the world.

The course will consider the emerging &quot;market&quot; or economic discussion, reviewing what academics, the press, financial institutions, etc., mean when they speak of these countries, with acronyms such as BRICs, BRICS, MINT, and others. What is the key factor: size, growth, novelty, potential or promise? Which of all of these questions is truly relevant and important? The second part of the class will examine regional, geopolitical issues: are these countries important actors in their regions? Why or why not, and how does their economic performance influence their regional political action (domestic ideological and institutional issues would also be rapidly addressed here)? The third part of the class will turn to international and multilateral factors: are &quot;emerging powers&quot; truly powers? Are they all the same? Do others see them as powers? How do they express their economic success or geographic and demographic clout in the international arena?    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 184 UN: Negotiation towards A New Binding &amp; Universal Agreement on Climate Change in Paris in Dec 2015                                                                   The United Nations (UN) provides the forum where states come together to discuss mutual problems. In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

Students learn to manage and analyze such data and to deploy statistical techniques that are common in these applications, with an emphasis on how to translate social science theory into empirical research. Topics include review of basic regression analysis, building multivariate analytical models, and regression analysis with limited dependent variables. The course emphasizes practical training in these skills as well as evaluation, replication, and critical analysis of research conducted in the social science literature. The course assumes knowledge of the material covered in Statistics for Social and Behavioral Sciences and is designed as alternative for students in the social sciences who are not taking Introduction to Econometrics.

SOCSC-AD 101 Mathematics for Social Sciences I                                                                   This course provides an introduction to topics in mathematics immediately relevant for social scientists beginning their studies in Economics, Political Science, or Social Research and Public Policy. Beginning with a review of sets and functions, the course covers key topics in univariate calculus and introduces the notation associated with basic linear algebra. The course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course provides an introduction to mathematics as the lingua franca of modern social sciences, and focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences.    *Note: This course is only open to students who started before 2015.

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing.

They are perceived as &lsquo;social problems&rsquo; and divide public opinion about the appropriate ways to protect society from their deleterious effects. Lectures first focus on sociological perspectives on social problems and examine the role of social structure and social processes in their production and reproduction. Subsequent lectures focus on exploring selected social problems such as: suicide, suicide terrorism, euthanasia, aging, genocide, incest, genomics, and religious fundamentalism. The selected social problems are examined in a global perspective, focusing on contemporary industrialized societies.

This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.

The key research questions informing this project are: What conceptions do Somalis in Somalia, Ethiopia and the diaspora harbor to address historic and recent violence and how do these relate to Islamic, Somali customary and human rights law? What are the implications of these conceptions and plural legal orders for a place-based approach to transitional justice in protracted conflict?
